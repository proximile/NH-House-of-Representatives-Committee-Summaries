remember when i was in college and i was
 
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
doing some uh
 
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
i took acting one and acting two
 
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i had to uh memorize
 
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
all of the lines uh and i
 
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
thought that perhaps by this time i
 
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
i should have the chairman script
 
00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
memorized but
 
00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 align:start position:0%
i don't so i will read
 
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 align:start position:0%

page by page so we're ready and willing
 
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
to do that anytime
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
okay that sounds perfect
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
um does anyone have
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative heath thank you madam
 
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
representative heath thank you madam
chair

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
and um thank you all for being here i
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
just it's so
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
fascinating everything that that comes
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
out of your department
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
um i see that we have somebody here from
 
00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.029 align:start position:0%
um i see that we have somebody here from
aeronautics

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
aeronautics
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
and um the first section of our budget
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
um kind of relates to that
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
could you just kind of talk a little bit
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
about what's going on what's new
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
um some of the things you're asking for
 
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.230 align:start position:0%
um some of the things you're asking for
uh

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
what's happened over the last biennium
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
you want me to handle that commissioner
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
i think that's appropriate
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
um the depart the bureau of the division
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
of aeronautics rail and transit and
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
specific the bureau of aeronautics
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
oversees approximately 20 million
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in federal funding
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
through the airport improvement program
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
that funding actually goes through the
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the operating budget and
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
is matched by the state
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a 9010 program it's matched
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
um five percent and by the airports five
 
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.270 align:start position:0%
um five percent and by the airports five
percent

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
um there are 12 eligible federally
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
federally eligible airports
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
in the state three three commercial
 
00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:46.629 align:start position:0%
in the state three three commercial
airports

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
airports
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
which are of course manchester lebanon
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
and pease
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
and then there are nine general aviation
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
airports nashua being the largest
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh that are eligible for that funding
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
but we also have
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
funding available through the airway
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
toll which is also in the budget as a
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
separate org code
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
the airway toll funding is about 225 000
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
a year that funding primarily and
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
priority wise goes to the non-federal
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
airports the smaller uh airports that
 
00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:19.029 align:start position:0%
airports the smaller uh airports that
are

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
that may be privately owned but they're
 
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
open to the public
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh none of the funding goes to privately
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
owned that aren't open to the public
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
um so that that funding has been very
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
successful we just
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh went through governor and council to
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
approve um
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
re rehabbing the jaffrey airport
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh runway which hadn't been done since
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
1961 and was in very
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
dire need of being done for safety
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
reasons so that that airway toll fund
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
um very significant for those airports
 
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.350 align:start position:0%
um very significant for those airports
that

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
cannot realize federal funding uh the
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
other big thing we're looking at
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
in the office in in the bureau of
 
00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
aeronautics are uh
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
unmanned aerial systems or drones
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
and and in fact there's a position in
 
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
the budget that was granted two years
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
ago and it was carried forward by the
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
governor this year to have a position
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
to look at and to work with unmanned
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
aircraft systems both
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh from for private industries that are
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
using them but as well as the department
 
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.310 align:start position:0%
using them but as well as the department
that

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh is looking at using them for a myriad
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
of things
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh to do with with the construction
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
projects and inspection projects
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh the bureau of aeronautics also um
 
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.350 align:start position:0%
uh the bureau of aeronautics also um
inspects

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
inspects
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
all of the public uh open to the public
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
airports each year to make sure they're
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
that they're safe and
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
and they're compliant with faa
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines and we also
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
administer the aircraft registration
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
program uh so each
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
aircraft owner in the state of new
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire or who has a plane base in the
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
is required to pay an aircraft
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
registration fee
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
250 000 of that registration fee goes
 
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.470 align:start position:0%
250 000 of that registration fee goes
back

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
to those airports based on the number of
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
based aircraft in each of the
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
at each of those airports and then the
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
remaining balance goes into the general
 
00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:05.430 align:start position:0%
remaining balance goes into the general
fund

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's pretty much it in a
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
nutshell in case
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
unless there's any other specific
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
questions you'd like to ask on that
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
um just um on page 851
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
the equipment line and i know this is
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
all federal funds
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
um i see that you have a big decrease
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
um in the the pending um biennium
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
where you've gone from almost 4 million
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
4.1 million and 1.3
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
down to 870 000 um and then 340 000.
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
is that a decline in funding or what is
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
um that has to do with the um
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
the the state bus program so we needed
 
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.590 align:start position:0%
the the state bus program so we needed
this

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
one yeah oh okay all right thank you
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that was
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
that big increase when we we did a
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
replacement program for the 22 bus and
 
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.069 align:start position:0%
replacement program for the 22 bus and
express

00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
express
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
24 bus and express buses that we own but
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
that the replacement program will be
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
completed before the next biennium
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much and if i could
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
just follow up madam chair
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely um could you just um
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
buses have taken a big hit during the
 
00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:18.550 align:start position:0%
buses have taken a big hit during the
pandemic

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and i'm sure you have um
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
what what does it look like is it
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
starting to come back
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
or what do you anticipate it's starting
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
to come back but it's very slowly
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
coming back on the local public transit
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
side they're about at 50 percent
 
00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:34.310 align:start position:0%
side they're about at 50 percent
ridership

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
ridership
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
then pre-pandemic levels uh the inner
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
city bus
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
industry though is is in the commuter
 
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:40.630 align:start position:0%
industry though is is in the commuter
bus

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
bus
 
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
industry in particular is has not come
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
back yet
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
um ridership is
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
almost 90 percent less than what it was
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
but pre-pandemic
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
but it is it's part of our
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and luckily we
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
on the boston express side we'll be able
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
to realize cares act funding
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
uh to keep those buses going um because
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
at some point the commuter market is
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
going to come back uh we don't know to
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
what degree yet
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
but we need to be ready for when that
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
when that does happen
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%

okay uh seeing none uh mr hurley i
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
i do have a couple of questions
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
um in your
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
general fund area is that
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
all for airports
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
the general fund area for us is all in
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh staffing and administrative costs in
 
00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:42.949 align:start position:0%
uh staffing and administrative costs in
in

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
the in aeronautics and 2107 and in
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
the uh rail and transit is for rail
 
00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:49.590 align:start position:0%
the uh rail and transit is for rail
staff

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
for for rail staffing and for half of
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
the administrator's salary
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
for the rail and transit bureau the
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
administrator gets paid half federal and
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
half general funds representative
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
umberger there's also two hundred
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
each year in the transit bureau of
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
to assist the the locals with their
 
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.829 align:start position:0%
to assist the the locals with their
match

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
match
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
um against the federal program that was
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
um included in the budget last year
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
um and had the governor has continued
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
that uh in our budget this year as well
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
yeah the fed the federal funding for for
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
local transit agencies
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
isn't uh for operating as a 50 50
 
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.790 align:start position:0%
isn't uh for operating as a 50 50
program

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
so 50 comes from the feds and 50 comes
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
from either local or state resources
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
and the 200 000 goes towards that 50
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
is that sufficient to cover the match
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
or uh do the local communities
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
need to pony up the local communities
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
pony up in a
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
and what communities are we talking
 
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.550 align:start position:0%
and what communities are we talking
about

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
uh wherever the public wherever local
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
public transit system so it's both rural
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
communities and urban communities
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
so the urban systems run on the seacoast
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
in manchester
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
in nashua and um at unh
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
and the rural community the rurals come
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
from the north country
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
north country transit carroll county
 
00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.990 align:start position:0%
north country transit carroll county
transit

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
transit
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
even concord area transit is considered
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
a rural service
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh sullivan county i mean they're they
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
they cover the state
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
for the most part so any any um
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
community that they operate in
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
is asked to provide part of that local
 
00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:42.150 align:start position:0%
is asked to provide part of that local
match

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
okay that's i just
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
i i thought that's what it was but i
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
i wanted to uh be sure um
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
so your your general funding you said
 
00:14:56.839 --> 00:14:59.430 align:start position:0%
so your your general funding you said
covers

00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
covers
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
mostly salaries is that and
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
mostly mostly what's in um org code 2107
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
so anything that's in 2107 which is
 
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.389 align:start position:0%
so anything that's in 2107 which is
aeronautics

00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
aeronautics
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
all of that is general fun
 
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
except for the air well the airway tolls
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
it's on separate
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
and then what's in um
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
2931 railroad that cover that so that
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
and then as marie mentioned the 200 000
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
that goes towards the local transit
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
match and half the salary and benefits
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
okay and there have been no personnel
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
increases or anything like that in
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
either of those
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
divisions um for this
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
proposed biennium yes no there was a
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
transfer of a highway funded position
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
um from highway design into rail and
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
transit because that person works on
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
but that's highway funded okay so
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
that person is considered highway funded
 
00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:24.550 align:start position:0%
that person is considered highway funded
correct

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.829 align:start position:0%
correct
okay

00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
staffing

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
okay are there
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative heath thank you madam
 
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.829 align:start position:0%
yes representative heath thank you madam
chair

00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
um last session we spent a lot of time
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
talking about rail um and
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
what was happening with rail could you
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
just update i see
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
that um that it's pretty
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
consistent um in the general fund uh
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
for uh that line can you just update us
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
on how that's going and um
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
what the plan is anything input for
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
anything in particular or
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
the at the uh real
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
transportation to boston from manchester
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
uh the capital corridor project yes
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
yes the cap the capital pride capital
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
corridor project we are currently in the
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
project development phase for that
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
so we did a study back in 2014
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
which looked at alternatives to to get
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
to boston
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
um the alternative of the of a
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
manchester regional service
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
with two stops in manchester two stops
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
to nashua
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh to go on to the one at manchester
 
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.510 align:start position:0%
uh to go on to the one at manchester
airport

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
airport
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
to go to boston um that is a federally
 
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.270 align:start position:0%
to go to boston um that is a federally
funded

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
project the pro that we're working on
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
the project development phase includes
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
the engineering
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh to come up with a cost a realistic
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
and final cost estimate that we need to
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
carry forward for the rest of the
 
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.270 align:start position:0%
carry forward for the rest of the
project

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
to do the environmental uh review that's
 
00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:08.710 align:start position:0%
to do the environmental uh review that's
necessary

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
and most importantly to come up with a
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
financial plan on how
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
this is going to get paid for how the
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
capital that
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
the non-federal capital share will be
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
paid for as well as the operating costs
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
so we just kicked that project off a
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
couple months ago we fired a consultant
 
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.150 align:start position:0%
couple months ago we fired a consultant
a

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
ecom this is a national consultant to
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
help with that
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
we have met with our federal partners at
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
the federal transit administration
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
we've also met with massdot and mbta
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
just to kick this off and now we're
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
looking at trying to schedule meetings
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
that that we need to to help us with
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
station design
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
station location as well as the
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
financial plan
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative maria question
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh if we can just go
 
00:18:59.600 --> 00:18:59.909 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh if we can just go
back

00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
a stat on 854 page 854
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
sorry um i assume on line 30 there's the
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
50 000
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
is that par these are two questions is
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
that part of the bus replacement
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
um or other sorts of replacement and
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
then what happened
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
in on line 46 so you have almost three
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized um
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
actual expense was nothing it's three
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand just what's the story
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
behind that
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray could you tell
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
me what page that was on
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
or with page eight five four
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
and i was particularly looking line 30
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
and 43 you know the consultants that
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
apparently were never used and they're
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
gone now and
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
um just the narrative behind that please
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray the
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
the consultant line that is for the
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
capital corridor and
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
we have gone to gnc so those funds are
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
encumbered and will be utilized
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
that's why you see the the decrease in
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
the out years um
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
because that contract has been um
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh contracted um and the equipment in
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
class 30
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
that can vary that's um uh you know
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
equipment for um that they that is
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
purchased with federal funds for
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
various um operations at the bus
 
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.669 align:start position:0%
various um operations at the bus
stations

00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
stations
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
um outside of the the boston express so
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
um that can vary from year to year in
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
the program
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and that 50 000 in fy 20
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
was primarily for camera replacement
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
security camera replacements at the bus
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
facilities that we own thank you so much
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:42.070 align:start position:0%
i'm so happy to hear about the capital
corridor

you're welcome
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
on aeronautics and rail
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
i have trouble trying to keep my fingers
 
00:21:05.679 --> 00:21:06.149 align:start position:0%
i have trouble trying to keep my fingers
on

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%

on me they don't have hard copies at
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
home yet so
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%

check your email you can find the link
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
to what we're working through
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mickey i
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
um dave rodriguez on the line i just
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know so you could
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
elevate him for
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
okay um is anyone else have any
 
00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.390 align:start position:0%
okay um is anyone else have any
questions

00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
this is dealing with the office of
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
federal compliance
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
and i noticed that in the last
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
two years there was nothing funded in
 
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:23.830 align:start position:0%
two years there was nothing funded in
that

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
area but yet we are
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
um putting in additional
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
what appears to be additional money in
 
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.590 align:start position:0%
what appears to be additional money in
22

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
and 23 or was that just
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
um just the way it was
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative umberger in that
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
it did exist um previously we had it as
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent highway funds
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
and as we evaluated you know their
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
functions we
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
determined that they really should be a
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
hundred percent federal funds
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
so you you see there that the the
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
funding was actually switched from
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
100 percent highway funds to 100 federal
 
00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.390 align:start position:0%
100 percent highway funds to 100 federal
funds

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
but that their budget overall budget has
 
00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:13.430 align:start position:0%
but that their budget overall budget has
not

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
increased from fy 2021 it's actually
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
um down slightly in both years
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
just explain what the role of the office
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
of federal compliance is
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
because we are a federally funded agency
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
we are required to
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
follow all federal guidelines across our
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
programs whether they're funded
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
directly with federal dollars or not and
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
so that's why previously
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
because they supported the entire
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
department we didn't show them as
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
a federally funded office within d.o.t
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day we're required
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
to have these programs because we
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
receive federal funds and so that's why
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're making the switch
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
it's a more appropriate way to fund this
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
particular office
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
but they will continue to support the
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
entire department
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
if i may on the previous page 868 shows
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
all the line items
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
for the uh for that office so you can
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
see there's
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
actually been some reductions that has
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
been renoted in 22 from 20
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative murray thank you madam
 
00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:23.909 align:start position:0%
representative murray thank you madam
chair

00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
um apropos it's someone you just said of
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
i see there are six positions in this
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
the office of federal compliance
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
you said they're also supporting um the
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
rest of transportation
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
so do they deal with compliance issues
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
that are not federally related as well
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
um so they're housed here but they also
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
do other work
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
their full-time isn't just federal
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
compliance it's also other
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
aspects of your your organization it is
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
full-time federal compliance um but the
 
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.990 align:start position:0%
full-time federal compliance um but the
federal

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
codes um require us to not just follow
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines on our federally
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
funded programs
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
so because we are receiving federal
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
funds as an agency as an example
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
we have to be an equal opportunity
 
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.830 align:start position:0%
we have to be an equal opportunity
employer

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
and so it doesn't matter whether we're
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
hiring for operation maintenance
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
which isn't federally funded or whether
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
we're hiring for those bureaus that
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
receive federal dollars
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
we still have to ensure that we are
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
following um all the criteria
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
around how we post and recruit for our
 
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.149 align:start position:0%
around how we post and recruit for our
own

00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
internal workforce and so that's
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
what i mean when i say they support the
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
entire department um it's not just
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
our bureaus and sections that are funded
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
directly with federal funds
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair the
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
in federal tax monies or whatever
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
how much do we get back percentage-wise
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
back to the state are you referring to
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
our federal gas tax
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
contributions representative petersburg
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes and any other
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
taxes that they may collect uh you know
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
for that purpose
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
for you know for highway um so
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
by law um where our federal gas tax
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
contributions are concerned
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
and we're required to get at least 95
 
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.350 align:start position:0%
and we're required to get at least 95
back

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
um new hampshire actually gets about 116
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
it varies um slightly year to year
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
um but that is based on and the fact
 
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:39.510 align:start position:0%
um but that is based on and the fact
that

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
the federal um highway trust fund
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
has been insolvent and there's been a
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
general fund infusion
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
to fund all the federal programs and so
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
that is why um we get slightly more than
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
what we pay in
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
and but we still get less federal money
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
than many other states
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
um of similar size uh to new hampshire
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
as an example we always um point out
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
the folks in vermont receive around 300
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
federal gas tax contributions um despite
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
the fact
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
they have less miles of national highway
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
system and a
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
smaller population in new hampshire
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes please go ahead
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
right and the
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of monies that it costs
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
to implement these federal programs
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh in other words the more we
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh how much does it cost to
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
implement these federal programs i mean
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know versus if we
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
kept the money you know without a gas
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the work that they're
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
funding is you know designing
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
construction efforts
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
and so yes there's an administrative
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
burden of following all of the federal
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
requirements um but many of those
 
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.950 align:start position:0%
requirements um but many of those
requirements

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
are actually um you know complementary
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
of what we have in state law
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of ensuring you know
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
competitive procurement opportunities
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
um and items like that there are certain
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
federal requirements which are
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
more cumbersome but i struggled to
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
articulate exactly what that
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
difference in cost would be between
 
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.549 align:start position:0%
difference in cost would be between
administering

00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
administering
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
projects under state law versus federal
 
00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:30.470 align:start position:0%
projects under state law versus federal
law

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's more delay just working
 
00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:34.549 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's more delay just working
through

00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
for example environmental permitting
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
processes and things like that can take
 
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:38.950 align:start position:0%
processes and things like that can take
time

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
and certainly when we have to have
 
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.990 align:start position:0%
and certainly when we have to have
documents

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
documents
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
reviewed and approved by federal
 
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.669 align:start position:0%
reviewed and approved by federal
agencies

00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know that can be cumbersome
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
but as i said you know a lot of the
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
other aspects of administering these
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
programs are
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
are similar whether we're following
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
federal guidance or state
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative porter you have
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
your hand raised
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair i just wanted to let you
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
know my husband is now in the room with
 
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.549 align:start position:0%
know my husband is now in the room with
me

00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
along with one of our cats okay
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
let's do cat all right
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
okay um i would like to
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i just wanted to
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
move to um the highway
 
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance is it okay to move ahead
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
and it's way at the bottom and it's
 
00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.029 align:start position:0%
and it's way at the bottom and it's
federal

00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
revenue experts from other oh transfers
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
there um and then we've got the line
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
that says federal funds and i think i
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
know the answer to this
 
00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
the 41. page uh i'm sorry the page is
 
00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.830 align:start position:0%
the 41. page uh i'm sorry the page is
876.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
876.
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
um commissioner is that the infusion
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
that you have from um the cares act
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
on that line under 2022
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
where it says federal funds it's all
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
zero except that one spot and then
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's lists the highway funds and then my
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
second question is
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
are you seeing a return to a more
 
00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:26.870 align:start position:0%
are you seeing a return to a more
healthy

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
um so i'll let marie take the first
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
question and i'll take the second so
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
i'll start with that response
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
um you know we have been working very
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
closely with our colleagues at the
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
um as we try to forecast revenues
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
and we discussed this at some of the
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
last work sessions
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
um we're still not seeing traffic
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
volumes returned to
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
pre-covert levels um you know on more
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
rural roadways
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
traffic volumes are down to a lesser
 
00:31:00.399 --> 00:31:01.269 align:start position:0%
traffic volumes are down to a lesser
degree

00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
degree
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
but on our you know high volume
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
facilities because of the reduction in
 
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
commuter traffic
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
and we're still seeing um less
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
significantly less cars on the road
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
and so it does depend on the car door um
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
now if you know if you're watching the
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
revenue focus you'll see that in areas
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
like registration fees there's been
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a bump um but overall
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
no we're not seeing the highway fund
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
return to pre-covert levels
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then as we explained during our last
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
work session you know
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
further as we look to the future the
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
increase in fuel efficiency of vehicles
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
um is still something that we have to
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
pay close attention to
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
so it'll be a challenging time for all
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
of us
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of projecting revenues um we're
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
watching what's happening in other parts
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
of the country
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
for the turnpike um we have a consulting
 
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.190 align:start position:0%
for the turnpike um we have a consulting
firm

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
firm
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
that assists us in forecasting uh first
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
the traffic
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
um and then the associated revenue and
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
you know we're partnering with safety
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
and trying to provide them with as much
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
information as possible
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
since they're the ones that collect the
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
revenue to support them
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
as they're presenting to ways and means
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
and working with the governor's office
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
and revenue thank you
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
do you want to answer the other question
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so the the 41 million dollars uh
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
you're correct
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
representative heath that is um it's
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
related to the
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
um coronavirus relief act that was
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
enacted at the end of december so it's
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
different than the cares act
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
um it's this the subsequent one that was
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of signed into law at the end
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
of december
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
and so dots were provided direct funding
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
in that bill
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the state of new hampshire dot was
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
provided 41 million dollars so
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
that is where we have placed those funds
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
to be utilized and as you can see it
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
displaced the highway funds for that
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you that was going to be my next
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you you're welcome
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
and uh if i could follow up on that
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
uh marie are we anticipating
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
getting any uh funds out of the new
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
act that will be signed tomorrow that
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
can be used
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
with the highway fund um there
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
there aren't any direct funds to the
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
highway fund in that bill there are some
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
funds for aeronautics and and transit
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
that are direct but not to the highway
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
and state dots
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
the state will be receiving and the
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner can probably expound on
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
this more the state will be receiving a
 
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.230 align:start position:0%
this more the state will be receiving a
portion

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
portion
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
of the 350 billion going to state and
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
local government
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
of that portion that the state dot may
 
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:48.870 align:start position:0%
of that portion that the state dot may
receive

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
receive
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know we don't know at this time but
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
you know may want to add something to
 
00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:56.230 align:start position:0%
you know may want to add something to
that

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
um so marie is correct there's no direct
 
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.470 align:start position:0%
um so marie is correct there's no direct
assistance

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
for lost highway related revenues
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
um we you know continue to advocate at
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
the federal level
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
um that we have seen significant
 
00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:11.030 align:start position:0%
um that we have seen significant
reductions

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
um both on our federal aid system and
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
but also on the turnpike system
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
and so um we will be working with the
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
governor's office and trying to learn
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
more about what the opportunities might
 
00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:21.990 align:start position:0%
more about what the opportunities might
be

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
with the assistance that was provided
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
for state and local governments
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
i know that there are some
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities that would
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
hope to use some of those relief dollars
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
for transportation purposes perhaps
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
but it's very early to we haven't even
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
seen the guidance yet um
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of how those dollars can be
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
used other than the bill text
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then um now that the relief bill has
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
moved forward for the president's
 
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
signature we expect congress in short
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
order to start talking about an
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure package
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
and that might be where there's more
 
00:34:56.079 --> 00:34:57.670 align:start position:0%
and that might be where there's more
opportunity

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
to advocate for highway investments
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
not just capital projects on the
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
national highway system but perhaps some
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
assistance for projects
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
on the non-federal aid system and so we
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
will continue to advocate
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
in the weeks and months ahead that we
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
there's going to be federal funding for
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that that be as flexible
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
um a package as possible so that we
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
could really try and
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
um ensure that we're you know assisting
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
with addressing this lost revenue
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
across our entire network not just on
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
the assets that would typically be
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on this
 
00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:42.870 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on this
issue

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative heath oh thank you madam
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
chair i'm on
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
looking at um this continues to be
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
about um oh i'm sorry i'm actually
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
jumping to bridge maintenance
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
is that all right on page 878
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
of course that's fine um
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
on underneath estimated source of funds
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
for bridge maintenance bureau
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
you have um projected the
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
highway funds for 2022 8.4
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
and then for um 23 8.8
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
now is that a high estimate uh
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
for those lines i'm just
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
based on what you've said about the
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
highway funds um
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'm fearful that that
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
won't be a reality and if that isn't a
 
00:36:35.839 --> 00:36:36.790 align:start position:0%
won't be a reality and if that isn't a
reality

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
what does that mean so representative
 
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:40.870 align:start position:0%
what does that mean so representative
heath

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
heath
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
we've worked very closely with the
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
department of safety you know we're
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
confident that um
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
the revenue projections have been put
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
forward are
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
realistic and so this is a balanced
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
budget um
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
based on the current revenue projections
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh this work
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
would be funded i also want to
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that dave rodrigue our
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
director of operations
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
um has joined the call and so if you do
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
have specific questions on the work of
 
00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:08.630 align:start position:0%
have specific questions on the work of
our

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
operations bureaus he is available as
 
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.950 align:start position:0%
operations bureaus he is available as
well

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murray
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh same page
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's where i was headed but a little
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
bit further up
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
the 1.7 million that was in 2021 i guess
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
that was not expended
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh can you tell me the story about where
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
that went
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh it says is that operational services
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
and just you know what that means
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
um what it means in the paper but also
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
what it means in real life
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
and there's the two million or one and a
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
half million
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
drop in your total budget for that
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
pardon me um is that going to impact
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
your ability to continue to do
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
so this funding was a new program in the
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year 2021 program it was for
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
bridge washing
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
that was to be able to um wash some of
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
our tier
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
tier one high volume bridges um
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
every year instead of every other year
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
they cove it in the revenue
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
shortfalls this program was
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
eliminated in fy 20 and 21 to
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
to you know assure we had sufficient
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
funds to maintain
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know the system and it was also cut
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
in our 2223 budget to be able to balance
 
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
um based on the reduced revenue
 
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:37.990 align:start position:0%
um based on the reduced revenue
projections

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely is that a is this a
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
covert related fatality or is this
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
something that's more
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
inherent in what transportation is
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
so representative murray um i'm really
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
for the benefit
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
of the new committee members today um
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know as marie said this was a new
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
program so given the help of the highway
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
fund and then how significantly
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
cloven 19 impacted our revenues there
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
was several items that we put on hold
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
last year that we could lapse additional
 
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.550 align:start position:0%
last year that we could lapse additional
dollars

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
and then in this budget um as marie
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
explained because of the health of the
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
highway fund we're not moving forward
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
um so it's not just uh this particular
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
item around bridge washing
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
um for the the new members today
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know we've other programs such as
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
guardrail repair and graffiti removal
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
that were funded in the last budget and
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
we did not move forward and expand those
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
dollars because of
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
covet 19 and then we have not included
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
those items in this budget
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
because of the ongoing concerns about
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
the health of the highway fund
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
thank you so if i might
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
follow up on that so the drop from
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
10 million to 8 million that is
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
in all brick bridge washing guard rails
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
or is that just in the bridge washing
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
area this is
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
the bridge maintenance bureau so this is
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
just the reduction in
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
the bridge washing but as you go through
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
bureau's budget you'll see similar
 
00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:15.589 align:start position:0%
bureau's budget you'll see similar
changes

00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay okay so we're not eliminating the
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
bridge washing program or the others
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
we're just cutting back on how much
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
we're doing is that
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing correct ideally we'd
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
wash our bridges you know every spring
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
after the winter season to wash away all
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
the salt um
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
these additional dollars would allow us
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
to do that instead we're going back to
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
every other year
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
essentially all right thank you thank
 
00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:42.150 align:start position:0%
essentially all right thank you thank
you

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative petrie have a question
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh on the uh 20 match
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
do you feel confident that you'll be
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
able to meet the 20
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
you talk about the 20 match you mean our
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
20 match to federal
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
projects or are you talking about the uh
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
no the low
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
one when the uh when a low
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh matter of fact municipality like
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
farmington uh we have several
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
redless bridges and if we decide to
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh build those will the 20 be there
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
that uh for the match
 
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
so the municipality provides the twenty
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
percent match
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
we progress i'm sorry but if
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
if the twenty if you if they put up to
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
20 percent
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
is the money there for the rest of the
 
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.309 align:start position:0%
is the money there for the rest of the
bills

00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
so i think we touched on this last
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
session i apologize i don't have the
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
chart in front of me
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
um but the we are very confident
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
um that we have adequate revenue um
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the short term to proceed with all of
 
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:55.990 align:start position:0%
in the short term to proceed with all of
the

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
bridge projects that are programmed in
 
00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.030 align:start position:0%
bridge projects that are programmed in
the

00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
state a bridge program um i think what
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
you're referring to
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
is over time
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
the revenue projections um as well as
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
the principal payments kicking in on the
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
tiffy alone
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
mean that there is concern about the
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars available for
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
the city bridge program but for this
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
budget we are very confident that we
 
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.069 align:start position:0%
budget we are very confident that we
have

00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
adequate funding um and that's something
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
that we'll look at more closely you know
 
00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.510 align:start position:0%
that we'll look at more closely you know
it's

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
um it's a concern into the out years but
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
we need to continue to monitor the
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
revenues and
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
adjust the projections accordingly thank
 
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.470 align:start position:0%
adjust the projections accordingly thank
you

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative i do thank you madam
 
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:44.710 align:start position:0%
representative i do thank you madam
chair

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh good morning commissioner sheehan uh
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
i guess the question be for you
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned something near and
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
dear to me uh graffiti removal
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
um do you i know it's not a single line
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
item but
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
do you have a number for say the last
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
year on
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
a dollar amount on how much was spent on
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
graffiti removal
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
and then um if possible if i could
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
get a number on say five years ago what
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
that number was
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
i'm just seeing a huge increase
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
everywhere i drive and it drives me up a
 
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:17.750 align:start position:0%
everywhere i drive and it drives me up a
wall

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
wall
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
seeing it i just would like to know uh
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
you know how much we're actually
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
spending on that thank you
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if any of us have
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
those numbers at hand today um certainly
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
my colleagues can chime in if they do
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
i will tell you representative um
 
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.589 align:start position:0%
i will tell you representative um
unfortunately

00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
with the health of the highway fund and
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
the concerns um
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
around available revenue we really have
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
cut back to focus on
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
our core maintenance of the system and
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
in particular you know
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
public safety and operationally making
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we're addressing issues
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately some of the more
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
cosmetic things um
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
as important as they are in terms of
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
setting the right
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
or first impression for visitors who
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
come to the state and for others
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's the type of work that we have
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
been forced to defer
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
um so i i'll um
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
happily uh get that information for you
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
what's been spent in the past
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
and um what we've been spending most
 
00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.550 align:start position:0%
and um what we've been spending most
recently

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you that that'd be very helpful
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay are there other questions
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay i i would like to if i
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
figure out what were what we're going to
 
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.430 align:start position:0%
figure out what were what we're going to
do

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
i i see that if i am
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly uh you have
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
um increased the winter maintenance by
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
um four million dollars
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
and i know in the past we generally have
 
00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.230 align:start position:0%
and i know in the past we generally have
not

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
funded um winter maintenance
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
at 100 level and
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
um i was wondering where
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh we stood on that
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
and whether or not
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
we can reduce winter maintenance
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
costs at this point knowing that
 
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
as time goes by if
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
indeed you need to come to fiscal uh
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate so
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
i'll start and let marie or others chime
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
so when we were working on the budget in
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
the governor's face
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
we anticipated um having to come back to
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal this year
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
to ask for additional dollars for winter
 
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.150 align:start position:0%
to ask for additional dollars for winter
maintenance

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
fortunately and the last couple of weeks
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
have been milder
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
than we had anticipated and so we've
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
been looking at what our needs are
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
between now and the end of the winter
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
season and so
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
we are going to be moving forward with a
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal item on the next
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
meeting agenda but the ask is much
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
smaller so
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
um that means there'll be additional
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
dollars available
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
to help address some of these highway
 
00:46:37.119 --> 00:46:37.990 align:start position:0%
to help address some of these highway
fund

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
issues and then with respect to the
 
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.589 align:start position:0%
issues and then with respect to the
upcoming

00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
upcoming
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
um budget you know we were very pleased
 
00:46:45.359 --> 00:46:45.670 align:start position:0%
um budget you know we were very pleased
that

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the governor's phase um we were
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
funded for
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
an average winter whereas typically we
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
funded at a lower level and then as you
 
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.069 align:start position:0%
funded at a lower level and then as you
explained

00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
explained
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair we have to go to fiscal and
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
ask for additional dollars
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is the revenue
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
projections from house ways and means
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
for the highway fund are a little bit
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
lower than in the governor's phase
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
and so um certainly if you're looking
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
for areas to cut from
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
um we've explained how lean we are in
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
other areas of the department
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
um it would be appropriate to reduce the
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
amount that's been budgeted for winter
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
once again
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that if we had an
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
average winter or worse
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
we would go to the fiscal committee and
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
request those additional dollars at that
 
00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:30.950 align:start position:0%
request those additional dollars at that
time

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
um so i know that marie had a
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
conversation with steve lavoy from
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
safety and with mickey so i'll let her
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
talk about the specific dollar values
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
are thinking um but yes certainly
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
our preference would be that if you're
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
reduce certain items based on revised
 
00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:49.670 align:start position:0%
reduce certain items based on revised
revenue

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
projections that we would um
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
rather than have unnecessary cuts from
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
other areas of dot
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
and then up then end up having a mild
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
winter not using all of those winter
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
maintenance dollars
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
um it makes a lot of sense to do what
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature has done in the past
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
reduce the value of those lines hope
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
that mother nature is kind to us
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
um and then if she's not we'll go to
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
marie would you go ahead please sure
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
so um for fy 21
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
in the governor's phase for in the
 
00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:24.790 align:start position:0%
in the governor's phase for in the
projection

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
projection
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
in the surplus statement we had
 
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.069 align:start position:0%
in the surplus statement we had
projected

00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
projected
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
needing approximately nine million
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
dollars uh for
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
additional for winter um as the
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner stated
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
it's been a little milder recently we've
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
we've taken a look at the numbers
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
and we feel we'll only need about 5
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
million of that 9 million dollars so
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
therefore an additional 4 million would
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
be able to go towards the highway fund
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
deficit towards those revenue reductions
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
um and then um i know based on the the
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
revenue changes there will be some
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
changes to block grant
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
um and so whatever the net
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
cha difference is that's needed in the
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
highway fund i'm sure mickey
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
um is calculating that um you know that
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
that amount what if it's a million a
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
million and a half
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
2 million whatever that might be we
 
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.790 align:start position:0%
2 million whatever that might be we
would

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know be willing to reduce our class
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
20 line
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
equally over fy 22 and 23
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to have the highway fund
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
balance at the end of the biennium
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh mickey have
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
have you looked at the block grant
 
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.470 align:start position:0%
have you looked at the block grant
numbers

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
i have and i i mailed those out emailed
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
those out to everybody last night
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
so based on based on uh the
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
house estimates versus the governor's
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
estimates um i think block grant
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
just because that is a statutory formula
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
revenues uh certain road toll and motor
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle fee revenues
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
um a budget adjustment of about four
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
net over the two years um would probably
 
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.510 align:start position:0%
net over the two years um would probably
be

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh prudent to make um and it's
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh customary that's what we do at each
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
phase in the budget we'll line up
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
block grant sb 367 account as well as
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
betterment to align with the
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
road toll and motor vehicle fee
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
estimates so based on what marie
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner were saying about
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance for this year
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
the reduction from 9 million to 5
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
as far as the need to close out fiscal
 
00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.230 align:start position:0%
as far as the need to close out fiscal
21

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
also making that adjustment to the block
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
grant appropriation leaves about a
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
million and a half
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
over the biennium to get the highway
 
00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:42.630 align:start position:0%
over the biennium to get the highway
fund

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
into the black so to speak so to do what
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
marie was discussing
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
to do equally over the two years in
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance class 20
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
a 750 000 a year reduction of that line
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
would have a balanced highway fund
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you marie thank you
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner sheehan uh representative
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair this is a real newbie
 
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.309 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair this is a real newbie
question

00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm listening to this and i'm trying
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
to understand how this process works
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
the department comes in and asks us for
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
make up a number a thousand dollars to
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
take care of the roads for the winter
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
in an average an average cost would be a
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
we come back to them and say we'll only
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
give you eight hundred dollars
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
if you need more come to fiscal is that
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
how it works
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
that's exactly how it works and can i
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
ask another question
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's how it works as long as there's
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
money in the highway fund
 
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
can i ask yeah can i ask another
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
question then what happens if there's no
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
money in fiscal for
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
how do we pay for maintaining the roads
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
that heavy winter that we weren't
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
expecting because
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
um i think we'd flip a coin but mickey
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
maybe you could give us a better answer
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
than that
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
it is a newbie question i i apologize
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
for my ignorance
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
i i mean fiscal has the authority to uh
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
although i can't recall it happening
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
anytime in the last decade or so to
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
approve an item that is projected to
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
send the highway fund into a deficit if
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
if they so chose to do that
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
obviously uh at any point in time that
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
the department or
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know comes forward with a request to
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
draw from highway surplus
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're projecting that fund balance as of
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
that point so for instance we're coming
 
00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:46.630 align:start position:0%
that point so for instance we're coming
in

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
this next fiscal committee meeting with
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
a request and we're projecting out
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21's balance as of march
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
um it is it is up to the fiscal
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee should they want to
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
approve an item if the outlook was a
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
negative situation
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
um ideally we wouldn't be in that
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
situation but i think it's
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you we do not play shell games
 
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.349 align:start position:0%
thank you we do not play shell games
okay

00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:16.390 align:start position:0%
okay
that's

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
i think that that that's where we stand
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
on that but
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh fortunately in the past the highway
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
fund has
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
always been able to absorb
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
this now listening to
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
or looking at the the projections
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23 for the highway fund
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
we may run into some problems
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
but all i can do is ask you to drive
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
and make sure you spend some time on the
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
turnpikes as well okay
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately my new car is a hybrid so
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
even if i drive more it's not going to
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
help much but
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
um are there any other questions
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
that folks have
 
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:18.950 align:start position:0%
that folks have
[Applause]

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
let me continue flipping through my
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
pages here
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
but i think i have one but you might get
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
to me you might already
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
be there go ahead the reps of murray
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
can you just speak to what reimbursable
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
maintenance and repairs
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
um it you know there's not a lot of
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
change in there
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
but just um what that's going to how
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
that's going to look out for the next
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
couple years
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah these
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
this is a an area where
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
we have our guard rail repairs so when
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
folks hit and damage our guard rail we
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
have a claims process
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
those expenditures come through here if
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
we have any
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
major fema events you know
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
major winter storms flooding those type
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
of things
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
those things would go through here and
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
we would receive
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
revenue for those type of things so
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
they're more for like emergency
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
and damages that we'll get reimbursed
 
00:55:28.559 --> 00:55:29.829 align:start position:0%
and damages that we'll get reimbursed
for

00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
in the past we've had you know bridge
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
hits down
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
at the seacoast we've had you know we've
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
had a ship hit a bridge
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
um i remember that we were reimbursed by
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
insurance and those
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
costs go through here um so it's just an
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
availability for emergencies so we can
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
quickly respond and
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
make the repairs that are needed so this
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
changes this can change considerably
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
from year to year
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
um i don't suppose there's anything
 
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.549 align:start position:0%
um i don't suppose there's anything
really

00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
any covet funds that would be related to
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
anything around here because there are
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
some fema funds but it would not
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
none of that would affect would pertain
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
um well there are areas but they
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't go through this
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the covid related items are
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
personnel costs
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
related to folks working at the call
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
centers and that type of thing so
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily related to
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
construction um and repair type
 
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
type items so thank you yeah
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray uh we we also
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
have an hb2 item
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
dealing with this uh on the uh
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
insurance payback of insurance so that
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh um we'll discuss that when
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay let's go ahead represent a piece oh
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
um i'm gonna jump ahead to page eight
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
eight eight
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
if that's okay um we're
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
about over weight permits
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
um and under agency income
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's got um for
 
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
20 20 20 20 22
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
255.5 and for 23
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh for 19.1 is that
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
an anticipated increase based on
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
when things come back to normal because
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
i noticed in um
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
21 it was uh 392.3
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
so it it looks like is is that the
 
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:46.390 align:start position:0%
so it it looks like is is that the
reason

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
there's there's some um there can be
 
00:57:53.359 --> 00:57:53.990 align:start position:0%
there's there's some um there can be
some

00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
additional revenue in that area so we
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
basically will budget
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
for the expenditures in that year um
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
but when we get into fy23 you can see
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
there's an addition of some highway
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
funds in there
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
beginning in fy 23 we have a new
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
oversized overweight system
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
and the annual maintenance and hosting
 
00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:15.190 align:start position:0%
and the annual maintenance and hosting
costs

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
come into play and we have to start
 
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.630 align:start position:0%
come into play and we have to start
paying

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
that portion out of the oversize and
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
overweight permits so it
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
it that is bringing us over the amount
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
of revenue
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh we our expenditures will be over the
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
amount of revenue that we generally
 
00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.789 align:start position:0%
amount of revenue that we generally
collect

00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
collect
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
in that accounting unit so that's the
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
reason for that
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
that increase there you may see in fy 22
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
you may see some
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
additional revenue there but it's hard
 
00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:41.510 align:start position:0%
additional revenue there but it's hard
to

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
to to gauge and we we do try to reflect
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
what we
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
anticipate for expenditures and
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
generally any
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
revenue that comes in over our
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures lapses
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund thank you and then
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
i'm chair by may
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
certainly um marie
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
as we look at the volume
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
in especially southern new hampshire and
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
the seacoast
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
the volume of of trek seems to be
 
00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.230 align:start position:0%
the volume of of trek seems to be
increasing

00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
um by quite a bit do you have any
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
numbers or figures about an increase in
 
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:16.789 align:start position:0%
numbers or figures about an increase in
that

00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and its relation to revenue for the
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire i mean is that a
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
good thing or
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
do you does the department overall
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
suffer do the roads suffer from the
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
volume of
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
um increased those uh truckloads that
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
um go across our roads i
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
i would defer to dave i don't know if he
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
has the information
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
um on the number of trucks and the
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
increase in volume
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
we can get that for you but i defer to
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
dave rodrigue our director of operations
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
to see if he has
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
any of that information available thank
 
00:59:52.319 --> 00:59:55.030 align:start position:0%
any of that information available thank
you

00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you marie and thank you for the
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
question representative heath
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
i do not have um information
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
on the increase in truck traffic
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of our regular traffic
 
01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.829 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of our regular traffic
volume

01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
volume
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
but what i can tell you is that trucks
 
01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:17.559 align:start position:0%
impact and degrade our roadways
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
significantly more for for viet than
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
regular passenger cars in the weight
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
of the trucks on the roadways has a
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
significant event
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
or it has a significant increase in the
 
01:00:32.079 --> 01:00:33.270 align:start position:0%
or it has a significant increase in the
damage

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
damage
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
so what we always say is
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
trucks increase the damage exponentially
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
as the weight increases and it's
 
01:00:43.359 --> 01:00:44.190 align:start position:0%
as the weight increases and it's
actually

01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
exponentially to the fourth power
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
so what may seem like a very small
 
01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.109 align:start position:0%
so what may seem like a very small
increase

01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
in weight of the overall vehicle or even
 
01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:54.829 align:start position:0%
in weight of the overall vehicle or even
more

01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
specifically the axle weight of the
 
01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.630 align:start position:0%
specifically the axle weight of the
vehicle

01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
well it may seem like a relatively small
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
increase in the weight the amount of
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
damage that it does to the roadway
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
for let's say a 38 000 pound
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
axle load to a 40 000 pound axle load
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of damage for that change is
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
actually one and a half times the
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
the damage so as we get heavier
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
and heavier trucks on the road and
 
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.030 align:start position:0%
and heavier trucks on the road and
heavier

01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
heavier
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
and heavier axle loads the amount of
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
damage we do
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um it may i may madam chair
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
just to follow up quickly on that
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
problem um in relation to that um
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
that seems to make a lot of sense
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
because those trucks are getting bigger
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
it seems
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
um the costs that
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
you have revenue coming in with the
 
01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.750 align:start position:0%
you have revenue coming in with the
permits

01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
permits
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
but the costs to the damage to our roads
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
do they balance out or is does that
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
create more problems for you
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
so representative if i may this is the
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
oversized overweight program
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
individuals only need a permit when they
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
are carrying a load that exceeds the
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
statutory limits
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
and so many of the trucks you see on the
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
road don't require these permits
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
um yes they're large vehicles they're
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
heavy vehicles
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
and but their registration and other
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
fees are based on the weight
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
and so they are paying more for use of
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
the system
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
it's only if they exceed those statutory
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
load limits
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
um then they or they have an oversized
 
01:02:38.799 --> 01:02:39.750 align:start position:0%
um then they or they have an oversized
vehicle

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
then they have to apply for a permit um
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
and that's for everyone's safety we want
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
to make sure the route that they're
 
01:02:44.799 --> 01:02:45.670 align:start position:0%
to make sure the route that they're
driving

01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
driving
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure can handle both the
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
size and the weight of the vehicles that
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
would be on the road
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so it's it's not just this one
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
area that's
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
um that the trucks are
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
contributing to um they're paying the
 
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.430 align:start position:0%
contributing to um they're paying the
other

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
highway fund revenue as well
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
as contributing to this particular line
 
01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:12.069 align:start position:0%
as contributing to this particular line
item

01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay could we go back just a minute to
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
page 886
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
is this a result of road salt
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
so yes you're correct this is to do with
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
road salt um since we have dave i'll let
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
him explain the
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
program but we have many items that go
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
before governor and council associated
 
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:48.630 align:start position:0%
before governor and council associated
with

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
our uh assault impacts to wells
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chair for the for the
 
01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.069 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chair for the for the
question

01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
what what this is a a program that
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
the department is statutorily required
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
um to investigate and
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
under certain circumstances replace
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
wells that have been compromised um
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
by salt primarily due to
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
um salt use for de-icing so i don't have
 
01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.109 align:start position:0%
um salt use for de-icing so i don't have
the

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
the rsa in front of me that describes a
 
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.029 align:start position:0%
the rsa in front of me that describes a
program

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
but the rough variables are there was a
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
a point in time around um
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
the mid to late 1960s i believe
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
that if a a well was more
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
than a certain distance from the road i
 
01:04:43.039 --> 01:04:43.349 align:start position:0%
than a certain distance from the road i
think

01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's 75 feet and it was in place
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
before um 1960 something
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
if it becomes contaminated with salt the
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
department will pay
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
for the cost of the replacement for the
 
01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:58.870 align:start position:0%
for the cost of the replacement for the
well

01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
and in order that there's a process in
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
place where
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
the water is sampled over a six to 12
 
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.190 align:start position:0%
the water is sampled over a six to 12
month

01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
period on the salt has to show up at a
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
certain concentration
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
at each test um the topography
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
and everything has to make sense for the
 
01:05:18.079 --> 01:05:19.430 align:start position:0%
and everything has to make sense for the
contamination

01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
contamination
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
to come from a a state source not a
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
local or municipal source
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
and if all those things come together
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
the department will replace a well
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
for the for an individual if it's
 
01:05:32.079 --> 01:05:33.430 align:start position:0%
for the for an individual if it's
contaminated

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
contaminated
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
by us do we have any idea
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
how many wells fall into this 75-foot
 
01:05:41.359 --> 01:05:42.390 align:start position:0%
how many wells fall into this 75-foot
category

01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
category
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
across the state or is this just
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
the the way the program works we receive
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
a complaint from an individual
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
and then we we open up the investigation
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
um we tend to to replace about
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
three or four wells uh a year
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
um so on average sometimes
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh a little bit higher than that um
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
and if you'd like i can provide you the
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
the statute that describes the program
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
um and what we work and well that that's
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
fine i just wanted to
 
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
um know if we had any kind of projection
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh for the future of this program and it
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would add it has been
 
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
fairly consistent as dave said the
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
average of um you know three to four
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
um wells a year so uh you know at least
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
well we don't have the projection at
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
least monitoring the activity and stuff
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
if it was creeping up or anything we
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
would be able to
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
react and adjust to that the only other
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
thing i would just note it is specific
 
01:06:56.319 --> 01:06:56.630 align:start position:0%
thing i would just note it is specific
to

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
residential wells it doesn't cover
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
businesses or or municipal
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
wells so it's very specific to those
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
private residential properties
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative porter you
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a question madam chair and
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
being a pest again i'm going to need to
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
leave the
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
meeting in about 10 minutes no problem
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you we're glad you were able to
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay are there other questions from
 
01:07:34.319 --> 01:07:36.309 align:start position:0%
okay are there other questions from
anybody

01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
okay let's go to my favorite topic
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
okay okay um a page number
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh we're on page 889
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
how many lift bridges do we still have
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
do you want me to answer that i think we
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
have three
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
correct we have three glyph
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair we have three lift bridges
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
that are regularly
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
operated two in portsmouth the memorial
 
01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:26.550 align:start position:0%
operated two in portsmouth the memorial
and

01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
and sarah longbridge we have the hampton
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
river bridge
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
that is operated regularly during the
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
summer season
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
and on call during the winter season
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
and we have one other um
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
lift bridge that is operated
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
representative murray is very familiar
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
with that one the newcastle rye
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
i was just saying i told my grandson
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
that that bridge is going to be replaced
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
and he was just heartbroken
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
and he says he wants us to still be a
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
singing bridge i think i don't know
 
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
about that london
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
so i'm you know to follow up actually
 
01:09:11.839 --> 01:09:12.789 align:start position:0%
so i'm you know to follow up actually
potentially

01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
um two of these bridges will be going
 
01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.390 align:start position:0%
um two of these bridges will be going
away

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
the hampton bridge and the new castle
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
bridge although the
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
final the decisions are not there yet
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
but when you're talking about this can
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
you talk about the impact of not having
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
so as dave indicated the newcastle rye
 
01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:32.950 align:start position:0%
so as dave indicated the newcastle rye
bridge

01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
bridge
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know may only be opened once a year
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
so that's a minimal impact
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
um if the hampton harbor bridge
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
was to be replaced with a fixed
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
structure and then yes we would be
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
consolidating our operations we'd only
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
be responsible for the memorial on the
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
is there a projection as to when the
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
bill would you like to provide an update
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
on the schedule for that
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
project yes i know where i'm getting
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
ready to take the uh
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
zebra hampton project to a a public
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
hearing i believe construction is
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
programmed to start in 2023
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh it'll be at least a two-year
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
construction span so any um
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
changes at least to the lift bridge
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
operations probably wouldn't be affected
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
in this biennium but in future bienniums
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
would be we'd be looking at that that
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
staffing but
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
for about 2021 about two years till that
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
project begins construction
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
so we have that in the 10-year plan is
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
yes okay so
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll look at that in uh
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
24 and 25.
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll probably run into a million
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
environmental uh
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh programs but that's okay we'll see
 
01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:09.990 align:start position:0%
uh programs but that's okay we'll see
what

01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
we'll i know you guys will take care of
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
it so representative heath you have a
 
01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.149 align:start position:0%
it so representative heath you have a
question

01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um stickney avenue
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
facility um did we finish that project
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
or what where what's happening there i i
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
see a lot of zeros
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
um in that area what page are we on
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
um so representative heath you might
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
recall i'm doing the last budget
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
with the one-time general fund surplus
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
and we were provided
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
the dollars to demolish the styx
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
facility and then our intent was to
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
surplus the property
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
because that building is historic
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
um we were required to market the
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
building and see if there was any
 
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.110 align:start position:0%
building and see if there was any
interest

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
in someone purchasing the building
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
and renovating it rather than
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
demolishing it
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
and taking it down and through that
 
01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.430 align:start position:0%
and taking it down and through that
process

01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
we did receive one bid
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
and as is our practice we went to the
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
city of concord we always provide
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities with the first right of
 
01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.750 align:start position:0%
municipalities with the first right of
refusal

01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
refusal
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
the city chose to take up their right
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
or first refusal and so we've been
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
working through the purchase and sale
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
agreement with the city of concord
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
and so at this time we would not be
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
taking down
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
the building and we'd be selling it and
 
01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:37.510 align:start position:0%
the building and we'd be selling it and
with

01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
some of the historic covenants requiring
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
it to be
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
renovated um and restored
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
and then from an operations perspective
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
um we had been
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
using the stickney av site um several
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
agencies were tenants there
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we ourselves were storing materials
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
there and so
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
we've been preparing and clearing out
 
01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
that space
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
and and one by one agencies have been
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
consolidating their operations and
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
finding other locations
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
for the activities that were going on
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
there so
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
eventually the site will be sold and
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's why you'll see some of the items
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
being zeroed out in the budget
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair by may inquire
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
further about the other two
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
projects that they were working on
 
01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:22.950 align:start position:0%
projects that they were working on
absolutely

01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
um commissioner you had
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
there were two others i believe
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
did those did you finish those projects
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
or were they
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
delayed as well so the intent
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
at one point these projects were called
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
out individually i think in the
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
governor's phase the budget later it was
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
consolidated into one line item for
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
building demolitions
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
and so we were hoping to move forward
 
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:50.709 align:start position:0%
and so we were hoping to move forward
with

01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
potentially um demolishing a number of
 
01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:53.910 align:start position:0%
potentially um demolishing a number of
our

01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
closed rest area buildings and then also
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
there was a project to um remove a
 
01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:01.910 align:start position:0%
there was a project to um remove a
building

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
um in the um the rail yard in west
 
01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.709 align:start position:0%
um in the um the rail yard in west
lebanon

01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
lebanon
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
and um unfortunately again with covet 19
 
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
as with our capital budget items a lot
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
of those contracts were put on
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
hold temporarily because it was
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know there was a lot of concern
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
around general fund revenue
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
and um we didn't want to move forward
 
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
with any of those items
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
and should there be significant budget
 
01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.149 align:start position:0%
and should there be significant budget
deficits

01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
deficits
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
but the other items we are starting to
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
move forward with again at this time
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative murray thank you um
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
estimated sale price for stickney avenue
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
so the money will go back into the
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
highway fund um because that's how the
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
site was purchased and bill do you want
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
to i can't recall what the
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
purchase and sale price was or
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
yeah the um the bid by the uh
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
well yeah the the bid that was
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
subsequently matched by the city was
 
01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
subsequently matched by the city was
just

01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
under um a million dollars
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay um could we go back
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
on page 894
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
where the money is when you actually
 
01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:34.950 align:start position:0%
where the money is when you actually
purchase

01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
property or is that part of the
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
um construction project or
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
does it go in here yeah representative
 
01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:45.910 align:start position:0%
does it go in here yeah representative
um

01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
the the purchase of property is actually
 
01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:49.350 align:start position:0%
the the purchase of property is actually
part

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
of our federal program so you'll see
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
that as part of
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 3054 a little bit later
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
and it's class 401 land interest and
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's where
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
we appropriate the funds you can see
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
there's 10 million dollars each year for
 
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
okay do we have anything else here i
 
01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:43.990 align:start position:0%
okay do we have anything else here i
have

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
still have a couple of questions
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
but i need to i need to find them in
 
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.470 align:start position:0%
but i need to i need to find them in
this

01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
oh i just wanted to say that i love
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
the material research bureau
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
if um if any of you have
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
not ever had an opportunity to go to
 
01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.149 align:start position:0%
not ever had an opportunity to go to
this

01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm the only one that loves stuff
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
but it is a phenomenal
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
outfit and i just want to
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
say that it is uh it's something that
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
needs to go in the highlight of uh
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
things you need to do
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
in uh in new hampshire
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
but i anyhow i just
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
just want i did make a note to that
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
effect and uh
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
i wanted to pass it on okay
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
if i may madam chair you know we were
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
very disappointed with covert 19
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
and we weren't able to have an open
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
house like we did at the start of the
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
last legislative session
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
um to sort of showcase all of the
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
different aspects of the work at dot
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
but certainly we're always open to
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
conducting tours that people want to see
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
specific facilities or if there's
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
specific projects you'd like to
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
go out and take a look at with us in the
 
01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
field we extend that invitation
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
often to the members of the public works
 
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.830 align:start position:0%
often to the members of the public works
committee

01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
but obviously we'd be willing to host
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
any of you and
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
show you different aspects of what we do
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
i think you know the budget can be a
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
little dry
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's um much better when you see things
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
um in person
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
and both our materials and research
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
facility um
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
is impressive but also new mechanical
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
services we talk a lot about the fleet
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
with this group
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to have you tour our
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
facility and see the condition of some
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
of the trucks and the type of work that
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're doing each and every day
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
mickey you have already discussed the
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh changes in uh municipal aid
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
and so we don't we don't need to
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
talk about that you'll just make the
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
changes is that correct
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh i i think i would ask for the
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee to do a vote on that and we do
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
have a change sheet that's the one i
 
01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:14.229 align:start position:0%
have a change sheet that's the one i
sent

01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
sent
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
last night i can also share my screen if
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
everyone wants to look at that now
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
and ask the department any questions if
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
you want on the three accounts that
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
would be impacted but
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
i think i would ask for a committee vote
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
even though it's somewhat technical
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
oh i yeah i agree so yes why don't you
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh put that up in case somebody had
 
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i have to be honest i did not see
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
your email
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay you just want to walk us through
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
this mickey
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh sure it's up to you if uh you want me
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
to do it or if you want the department
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
to do it because they could probably
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
more to it but i'll walk through in that
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
if you have questions for them um
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
i'll defer so the first uh the first
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
would be the apportionment a so this is
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
your highway block grant to
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities which is the 12
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
based on the previous year's
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
unrestricted road toll and motor vehicle
 
01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.709 align:start position:0%
unrestricted road toll and motor vehicle
fees

01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
so based on the house ways and means
 
01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:21.910 align:start position:0%
so based on the house ways and means
revenues

01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
compared to the houses excuse me yeah
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
the house revenues versus the governor's
 
01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.110 align:start position:0%
the house revenues versus the governor's
revenues

01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
in year one there would actually be an
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
uptick of twenty five thousand dollars
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
right here you see the change column in
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
the middle and then in year two you see
 
01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:36.950 align:start position:0%
the middle and then in year two you see
the

01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
the savings so to speak to the highway
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
fund of four hundred and fifteen
 
01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
this is the only uh item out of these
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
three on this document that actually
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
touches highway funds unrestricted
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
highway funds
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
and again this this is just to align
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
the revenues up there's no change in the
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
formula or how the grants would be
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
paid out ultimately they still get paid
 
01:20:59.679 --> 01:21:00.470 align:start position:0%
paid out ultimately they still get paid
out

01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
based on the actual revenue received um
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
when that does come in but
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're just truing up the budgeted
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
estimates right now
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
and we pay a year in arrears correct
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
correct it's it's based on the previous
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
year's revenue
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
mary sorry representative heath you have
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
a question yes please
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
um for item one um that seems like a
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
very simple change
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
do we want to take action on that one at
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
a time or are we gonna act on these
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
i think we'll probably act on each item
 
01:21:36.719 --> 01:21:37.910 align:start position:0%
i think we'll probably act on each item
separately

01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
separately
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
okay would you like a motion to accept
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
that would work for me um then i
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
i move that we um for the department of
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
transportation we accept the proposed
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
item one
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
that they that we have before us with
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
the change
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
okay we need 23 as well
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
and um that's
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
a change of four hundred and fifteen
 
01:22:14.719 --> 01:22:15.189 align:start position:0%
a change of four hundred and fifteen
thousand

01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
forty four dollars and that's a
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
loss to the highway fund is that right
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%

okay thank you very much so mickey let's
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
so item two and three are um
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
restricted revenue accounts based on
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
road toll so the first is the betterment
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
account so betterment is uh
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
three cents off the gas tax less the
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
block grant that's paid out on that
 
01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.830 align:start position:0%
block grant that's paid out on that
portion

01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
portion
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh goes into a construction program
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
the department runs and so on page 907
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
the betterment accounting unit
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
i have here class line 400 as the
 
01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.229 align:start position:0%
i have here class line 400 as the
reduction

01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
i i'll defer to the department if that's
 
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:26.310 align:start position:0%
i i'll defer to the department if that's
a

01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
not the correct expenditure line to
 
01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:29.510 align:start position:0%
not the correct expenditure line to
adjust

01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
adjust
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
for this change but i think in the past
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
usually we we
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
would have impact class 400 so in the
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
first year
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
there's a reduction of uh nearly six
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
four five nine four zero zero eight and
 
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
is there any comment from uh
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
marie or the commissioner
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
that that class line is uh fine and
 
01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.149 align:start position:0%
that that class line is uh fine and
where

01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
we know it it's truing up the road total
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
revenue projection
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
so we agree with that change
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
do i have a motion to accept oh okay
 
01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.030 align:start position:0%
do i have a motion to accept oh okay

01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
and lastly the senate bill 367
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
account uh on page 909 this is the
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
4.2 dedicated uh portion of the road
 
01:26:16.159 --> 01:26:16.470 align:start position:0%
4.2 dedicated uh portion of the road
toll

01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
toll
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
the gas tax that goes to fund those
 
01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.830 align:start position:0%
the gas tax that goes to fund those
statutory

01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
um uh established uses so there's a
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
reduction here relative to block grant
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
paid on that portion of the road toll as
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
well as
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
um the net being the uh
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
class 400 the construction line done by
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
and again are there any questions or
 
01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:47.830 align:start position:0%
and again are there any questions or
comments

01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
sorry just from the department we agree
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
with that that change again
 
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
with that true up um and based on the
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
law and the the waterfall schedule that
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
we had presented to you
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
at our last meeting um it is appropriate
 
01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:00.709 align:start position:0%
at our last meeting um it is appropriate
for

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
for it to come out of the class 400 and
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay um representative murray you have a
 
01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.430 align:start position:0%
okay um representative murray you have a
question

01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um can you speak to how
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
this these lower estimates impact the
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
so these lower estimates would
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
just reduce the size of our
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
our program uh potentially the the
 
01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
amount of paving or
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
um bridge work that we're able to do um
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
for both items representative murray um
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
the reduction in the betterment and the
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
reduction in
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
the sb 367 revenue
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
they both actually impact the betterment
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
program if you recall
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
with sb 367 the waterfall is such that
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
we have the 12 block grant that comes
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
off the top and then we have
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
to pay um the interest on
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
i-93 we have the state a bridge program
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
and it's the balance that essentially
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
flows into the betterment account so
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's the betterment program that is
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
impacted ultimately by both of these
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
thank you it's sad to see revenues
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh could i have a motion please to
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
accept the um
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
capital investment from sb 367
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
changes murray don't move
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you do i have a second 30 seconds

thank you now if things change
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
within the next week we may have to
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
i after
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
steve lavoy who is you know works with
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
the collection
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
side i don't think that
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to see much of a change
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
in the road toll collections over the
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
next two years
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
from what's been projected so
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh anyhow thank you mickey for
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh putting that together in marie and
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that you helped okay
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
01:30:14.719 --> 01:30:18.950 align:start position:0%
are there any other
questions

01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay i i do yes murray
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this is probably
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
an uber question but again it helps to
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
have the broader narrative
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
on page 927 can we speak to
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
the um 19 million
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
authorized going down to a million
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
and the governor's recommended and 103
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
was spent
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
can we just get the back story behind
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
that event
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you so i i can answer that
 
01:30:50.639 --> 01:30:51.430 align:start position:0%
thank you so i i can answer that
representative

01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
um so this is this is the turnpike fund
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
and in the turnpike fund all the capital
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
work is included
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
in the operating budget so this is a
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
work that was planned
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
on the central turnpike um
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
based on the progress of
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
several of the major projects as well as
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
the impact to covert
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
the the spending on what was projected
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
on one of the capital projects
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
was not completed in 21 actually that's
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
moving um into 22 and 23. so
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's less money needed because these
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
are non-lapsing
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
accounts so that money actually
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
does not lapse it moves forward and
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
that money will be utilized in the
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
future on those uh
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
on the major capital work and actually
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
this money is probably slated for the
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
effie everett
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
might this is the total collection
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
so i think it might have to do with all
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
electronic totaling in dover rochester
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
i was looking at i was looking at the
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
top of the sheet central new hampshire
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
turnpike but i agree with you marisa
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
this is for
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
all electronic tolling um on on the
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%

01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
the new connection that the spalding and
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
route 4 where you take that turn off to
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%

01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
um concord is really fabulous yeah i
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%

01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
twice going one's coming back and it
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
works beautifully and it just it looks
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
terrific so thank you for
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm so if i may madam chair you know we
 
01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:50.709 align:start position:0%
i'm so if i may madam chair you know we
are

01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
very proud of the work that we do at dot
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
and we understand that
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
every single person who needs to travel
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of new hampshire
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
relies on us to do a good job so
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
um it has been a tough budget and
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
revenues obviously have made it
 
01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:04.310 align:start position:0%
revenues obviously have made it
challenging

01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
but we've worked very hard to be you
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
know conservative
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
and to really put the brakes on some of
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
our work
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
um at a time where revenues were
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
uncertain and we're pleased that
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
um as we've been first working with the
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
governor's office and now with
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
you on the 22 23 budget that we have
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
some confidence and can
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
you move forward this summer
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
construction season with some of the
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
projects that we had temporarily
 
01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:29.270 align:start position:0%
projects that we had temporarily
suspended

01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
suspended
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
and we'll continue to advocate the
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
federal level for as much assistance as
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
we possibly can get and i just want to
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank the entire team at dot
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%

and directors um you know are timely in
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
providing her the data and information
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
that she needs so it's
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
the team effort and we really thank you
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
for recognizing um
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
you know how much uh effort we've put
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
into this and most importantly the
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
financial controls that everyone has
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
been doing their part
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay just one last question i i think
 
01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:06.310 align:start position:0%
okay just one last question i i think
i'm

01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
full of it today um
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
of your uh personnel
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
positions how many are unfunded
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
um so representative we currently don't
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
have any unfunded positions
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
um but after your offer at the end of
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
last meeting um we did go away and talk
 
01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.550 align:start position:0%
last meeting um we did go away and talk
about

01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
how beneficial it would be to have that
 
01:35:33.119 --> 01:35:34.470 align:start position:0%
how beneficial it would be to have that
opportunity

01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
um to put forward on some unfunded
 
01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.390 align:start position:0%
um to put forward on some unfunded
positions

01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
in this budget and then have that
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be able to
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
potentially unfund a position
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
that is in the budget when it becomes
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
vacant and be able to instead move
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
forward with one of the
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions and so i really um
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for offering to provide us
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
with that flexibility
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
and we've been talking with mickey about
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
what the appropriate language might be
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
um to give you a a specific example of
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
where we might use this
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
um you know as we move towards
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
electronic tolling as an example and we
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
won't need
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh as many toll collection positions
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
um but we'll be using um easy pass and
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
we might need assistance in the back
 
01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:23.350 align:start position:0%
we might need assistance in the back
office

01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
so it'd be very helpful for us to put
 
01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:26.629 align:start position:0%
so it'd be very helpful for us to put
forward

01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
some new positions um that would be
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
unfunded at this time
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
and then you know as the budget would
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
progress we would be able to
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
unfund some of the vacated uh toll
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
collection positions
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
and instead move forward with an
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
alternative position that would be much
 
01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:44.470 align:start position:0%
alternative position that would be much
more

01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
efficient for us and then having to wait
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
until the position is vacant and go
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
through a reclassification process
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
and it would also take some pressure off
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
the division of personnel who works very
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
closely with our hr staff in that area
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so if that's still something the
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee is willing to entertain
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
and we'd be happy to continue working
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
with mickey on both
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
language as well as developing that list
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
of unfunded positions that we would
 
01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:07.430 align:start position:0%
of unfunded positions that we would
submit

01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
submit
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
for consideration absolutely somebody is
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
ringing my doorbell it's probably a
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:24.950 align:start position:0%

01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
well commissioner i just want to add i
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
hope that we can move that forward um
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
if not today very soon because i think
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's important for you to have that
 
01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.109 align:start position:0%
it's important for you to have that
authority

01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm pleased that that um we were
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
able to work on that
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
that flexibility seems like it'll
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
provide some um
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
freedom some efficiency yeah it's really
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
the efficiency being able to
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
onboard new individuals much more
 
01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:50.709 align:start position:0%
onboard new individuals much more
quickly

01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
or if we have individuals that want to
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
transfer laterally you know we're trying
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
to as we
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
move towards new technologies and
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
embrace innovation you're still
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
find opportunities for the existing
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
workforce to transition into new roles
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
i i agree totally and uh that was the
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
man that was coming to cut my blueberry
 
01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.910 align:start position:0%
man that was coming to cut my blueberry
bushes

01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
bushes
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
so that i can have some really nice
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
blueberries next year like i did this
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
year so
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
can i ask a basic knowledge question or
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
a lack of knowledge on my part
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
um the it's very strict and difficult
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
for you to move uh you know like in this
 
01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.030 align:start position:0%
for you to move uh you know like in this
case

01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
one position to some you know another
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
position there it seems to be very very
 
01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:39.750 align:start position:0%
position there it seems to be very very
siloed

01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
siloed
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
was there an historical reason for that
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
because it just seems to
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
tie the hands of agencies instead of
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
giving them a little bit more freedom to
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
do their work
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
i just wondered if there's a story where
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
there was abuse in that regard and
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's why we have these silos now and
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
is this something that is a longer
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
i have absolutely no idea representative
 
01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:09.910 align:start position:0%
i have absolutely no idea representative
murray

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
murray
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
um it's at least since uh
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
2012 when i first joined finance it's
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
been that way
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
and um i don't know
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh if uh mickey has any
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
background on this or or are we just
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh i have nothing really more to offer i
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
i would probably
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
defer to the department to be more
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
experts on the matters of
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
personnel rules and and everything
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
involved with that but
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
um i mean it's something we can explore
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
more if you'd like to at some point
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
um that's probably a pretty big
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
conversation for this stage of the game
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
you know where we're at with with this
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
year's budget but um
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
but yeah i mean there's state the state
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
personnel rules the division of
 
01:39:59.119 --> 01:39:59.990 align:start position:0%
personnel rules the division of
personnel

01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know has processes and and
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
everything so
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
it might uh uh be something to look at
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
for a uh a bill
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
in the you know in the future so
 
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a
 
01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
question madam chair i just want to
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
agree um as a former employee of the
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
and the time involved in um
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get on board new positions
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
um to trade positions to shift them
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
if it's still the same way um sounds
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
like it still
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
is it would be i think something that
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a division one
 
01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.189 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a division one
area

01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
but it certainly would help folks to
 
01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:50.629 align:start position:0%
but it certainly would help folks to
move

01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
move
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
okay um mickey have do we still need to
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh approve some uh house bill 2
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
so we've got the transportation highway
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
our excuse me um
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 sections that you could
 
01:41:15.119 --> 01:41:15.830 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 sections that you could
accept

01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
accept
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
what's in there now you've you've
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
received some feedback from some of the
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
policy committees
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
we can certainly go through those if you
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
accept those as they are right now and
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
take a vote and get those behind you
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
while you've got the department here to
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
as far as any new amendments i don't
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
have anything drafted but we can
 
01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:35.350 align:start position:0%
have anything drafted but we can
certainly

01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
we talked about the unfunded positions
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
establishing unfunded positions
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
there was other talks of perhaps uses of
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
any excess surplus from this year
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
that that came up at our last work
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
session with the department again we
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
don't have any language on that but
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
um we've been working behind the scenes
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
on some things and if that's something
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
the division wanted to have drafted we
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
could have that for the next work
 
01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.950 align:start position:0%
could have that for the next work
session

01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
that's up to you representative where
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
you want to go for the rest of the this
 
01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:02.790 align:start position:0%
you want to go for the rest of the this
morning

01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:42:06.390 --> 01:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
okay i think that um go ahead and draft
 
01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.270 align:start position:0%
okay i think that um go ahead and draft
what

01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
what you would indicated and we will
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
look at all of those at some other time
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh primarily because we have two
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
new representatives on our committee
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
and they need to be aware of
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
the um of the language that's
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh currently in hb2 and
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
um if we have any questions
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
we'll reach out to
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
not only not only dot but
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
okay i would go ahead reps and marie
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i just had one other comment
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
my neighbor's brother
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
used to work for d.o.t and he has
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
nothing but good things to say about his
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
okay i would like to close by thanking
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
everyone from d.o.t joining us today

and as has been expressed
 
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
this is not an easy budget year
 
01:43:19.590 --> 01:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
by any stretch of the imagination
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
