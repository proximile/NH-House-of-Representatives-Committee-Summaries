$175,000 a little more history behind
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
the the partiel um the town is likely to
 
00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
convey this to a nonprofit organization
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
that will be using it as part of the
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
restoration of the flying Yankee which
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
is a streamlined locomotive currently
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
owned by the department of New Hampshire
 
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
and is going to be conveyed to that in
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
the process of being conveyed to that
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
entity who will then restore it for
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
public uh use so I can answer any
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you yes please represent
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
Pro excuse me Senator PE so what's the
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
story behind the request to wave the
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
$1,100 fee the town asked us to wave the
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
$1,100 fee they didn't provide a
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
compelling reason why we should well I
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
think the idea is that it's going to go
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
to public use there is some so this this
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
parcel is very confusing if you've ever
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
looked at the deed the way the deed was
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
than so what occurred is that a deed was
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
written back in the 70s well the
 
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.430 align:start position:0%
written back in the 70s well the
original

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
deed describes the property next to the
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
property so uh an abstractor going
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
through and actually reading the deed
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
would be thinking that the deed is
 
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
conveying the property next door when
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
actually it ends and says the property
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
right next to this so that created some
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
confusion as to
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
ownership um the the town auctioned off
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
the property then it was determined that
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
it was actually State Property um being
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
used by one of our Patrol uh Highway
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
Maintenance uh sheds um for storage of
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
you know fill and gravel and any of that
 
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
stuff um so when that occurred we went
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
through the the Surplus property to see
 
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
if there were other areas let's face it
 
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
we own a lot of property in Conway so
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
there was a chance we can find another
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
property and and let this and knowing
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
what the use was for it it still
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation related that we went
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
ahead and started looking at this sale
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
so they already have the money from from
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
the auction to pay for this but they
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
haven't appropriated the $1,100
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
administrative fee Senator Lang knowing
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
that the $1,100 will just go back to the
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
local taxpayer and they'll have to pay
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
it I'm fine with waving the fee and
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
recommend we uh move to approve 242
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
second motion's been made and seconded
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
to approve item
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
26 uh further
 
00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:08.759 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none if you're in
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh motion carries
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
unanimously we will go to item 27
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%

$150,000 if you would
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chairman again this is
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
a uh this is a renewal of or we're
 
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
looking to this is a a property that we
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
brought before this committee almost two
 
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
years ago and uh the property was listed
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
at that time for
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
$200,000 it's located next to one of our
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
salt sheds it was bought as um back in
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
2006 it was 3.5 acres and
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
um it it has a residential dwelling on
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
it the department is going to
 
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
maintain I believe it's
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
2.5 acres or Department uh 75 Acres uh
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
the Department's going to make retain
 
00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:30.759 align:start position:0%
because of it has a uh has one of its
 
00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance sheds right next door to it
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
so we because it had a dwelling on it
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
because of the market at the time we
 
00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
listed it for 200,000 although we had
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
plenty of people have interest in it and
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
came through none of them were willing
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
to take it on it's been vacant I believe
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
since the time we purchased it um and at
 
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839 align:start position:0%
the time we purchased it the surrounding
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
area was all vacant wooded land
 
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
now the surrounding area or a good
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
portion of the surrounding area is a
 
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance shed so it just
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
makes it less desirable to somebody
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
looking to Market it even if they're
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
they're looking to flip it so we went
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
ahead and and sent out the marketing
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
analysis to our local Realtors up there
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
in region one and um our own opinion
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
came back at 138,000 looking at the
 
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
marketing analysis we went with Janet
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
and uh who who proposed a price of
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
150,000 looking at her analysis she seem
 
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:38.680 align:start position:0%

hear me uh my name is Patrick Hackley
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
I'm the director for the division of
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
forest and lands part of the Department
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
of Natural and cultural
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
resources so U it's fairly
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
straightforward like the other
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
transactions uh the department is
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
seeking the approval to dispose of a
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
state property known as Allen State
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
Forest uh it's about 30 acre parcel due
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
to the parcel's inherently difficult
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
access and small size uh the forest is
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
just not economically viable working
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
forest for us we we have done a forest
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
management operation on that several
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
years ago we don't intend to go back in
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
there if we were to hold on to it for
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
probably another 30 to 40 years um so we
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
desire to sell it on the Open Market at
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
fair market value as determined by a
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
recent appraisal um we have had interest
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
from an adjacent landowner to purchase
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
it at that appraised value and because
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to dispose of this
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
parcel for four or five years we felt
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
like it was most effective and efficient
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
to um work with the abing landowner at
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
the appraised value so um it was
 
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
appraised at$
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
129,000 um along with the $1,100
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
administrative fee uh it would it would
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
go to uh David Price senior and David
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%

22 uh and seconded any further
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none if you're in
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
favor of the motion for item 22
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
signified by saying I I if you're
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
opposed nay thank you thank you Patrick
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
if I if I could I had the commissioner
 
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
in here at the earlier meeting we've
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
spoke about that par and oy near 25 and
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
16 and I know that we're going to be
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
together at the
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
oy Natural Area meeting Natural Area can
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
pull that together uh I'm hoping that we
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
can have a further discussion on that at
 
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:45.799 align:start position:0%
that point yes because the state police
 
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
are have marked the road out there and
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
they won't let boats Park out there so
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
and it has to do with the parking
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
congestion there it's really to extend
 
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
the parking area into the state forest I
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
think is that the proposal that's our
 
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
hope yep okay thank you sir you back
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll move to item 18

Transit thank you for hearing this this
 
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
is a a fun one for me because this is a
 
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
location of significant drainage
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
problems and uh a situation where we're
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
going work together with the city of
 
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.950 align:start position:0%
going work together with the city of
lonia

00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
lonia
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
um the location is uh City street pus
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
Park Road which runs parallel to the
 
00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:08.110 align:start position:0%
Park Road which runs parallel to the
railroad

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
railroad
 
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
and it was actually built on an e
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh on a on a stretch of property
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
that individual Lots own and people
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
would have rights away over the lots to
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
their uh
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
camps well as years went by the city
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
took over the maintenance of this uh
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
Street and improved it and which way did
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
they go toward the
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
railroad however as um encumbering as
 
00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
that sounds they also put in drainage
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
and they maintain that drainage that
 
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
drainage takes um drainage sorry for
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
using the word drainage so many times
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
but the drainage from the rail road goes
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
right into the drainage for the uh pus
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
Park Road so the two uh the bureau
 
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
Transit the railroad operator and the
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
City of Lone have been historically
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out who's going to be
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
maintaining the drainage so in part and
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
parcel this easement would be
 
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
reconciliation of those three factors
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
and a better uh maintenance program
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
through the city's
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
offices because we Grant basically grant
 
00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:23.799 align:start position:0%
them imperity access to that stretch of
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
