you House Bill

432 which looks to uh include human
 
00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0%
trafficking on uh to be added to what we
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
currently know as the list of criminal
 
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
offenses that
 
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
prevent employment in schools in New
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um prior to the hearing I
 
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
provided members with a copy of that uh
 
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
18913 section five list of current
 
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
offenses that prevent employment in
 
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire and also a copy
 
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
of 637 which is the definition of human
 
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
trafficking from the criminal
 
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
code 432 was born uh during the last
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
legislative session uh
 
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
in a two-part fashion first uh we were
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
became aware in discussing other related
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
crimes that are included in section five
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
that human trafficking was not on that
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
list and given the fact that attention
 
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
was being drawn to human trafficking by
 
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
both uh the international crimes against
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
children task force Homeland Security
 
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
Police Chiefs across New Hampshire the
 
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh through
 
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
attorney Diana Fenton actually uh
 
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
requested that human trafficking be
 
00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
added to to this
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
list originally the bill also had a
 
00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
provision uh for outof State offenses
 
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
that were similar in nature that could
 
00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
be considered Equitable to the section
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
five offenses but subsequent to
 
00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 align:start position:0%
submitting the bill
 
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
uh I also made sure that each of you had
 
00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
a copy of the amendment to this bill
 
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.350 align:start position:0%
which is
00

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
00
 
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
15h and what 001 15h does is strike the
 
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
language from the bill that says
 
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 align:start position:0%
reasonably equivalent offenses uh in an
 
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
outof State jurisdiction would also uh
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
be eligible for preventing
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
employment that Amendment uh again was
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh the request of the Department of
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
Education who upon further consideration
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
decided that there was so much variation
 
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
particularly among the states around our
 
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
border that we would actually muddy the
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
waters uh and perhaps prevent things
 
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
from moving along in terms of human
 
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
trafficking uh sort of counter to what
 
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
the original intent of the bill was so
 
00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 align:start position:0%
as the bill stands amended and that is
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
what I'm hoping uh we will move forward
 
00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:02.189 align:start position:0%
what I'm hoping uh we will move forward
with

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
today House Bill 432 simply adds human
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
trafficking to the list of offenses that
 
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
prevents employment in schools in New
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I believe attorney Fenton
 
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 align:start position:0%

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education I want
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
to thank representative Mullen for
 
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward this bill is
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
fairly straightforward by way of
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
relevant background um RSA
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
18913a uh in the education law book has
 
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
a list of
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
offenses that would prohibit individuals
 
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
from serving as an educator um in the
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and I believe
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
representative Mullen has provided you
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
with that list if you look at it in the
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
statute book uh RSA
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
18913a they just list them by the
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
criminal offenses by number and that
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
confuses the heck out of me and it's my
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
job as a lawyer to know those offenses
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
so I created a cheat sheet and I hope
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
you find it as helpful as I find it um
 
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
you can see in that list of offenses
 
00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
they're pretty egregious offenses
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
capital murder child pornography
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
kidnapping um endangering the welfare of
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
a child anything child related and we
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
believe that human trafficking is
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate to add to this list human
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
trafficking has always been an offense
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
um however it was
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
recently codified in the criminal code I
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
think in in 2009 which explains why it
 
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't on the original list um in
 
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
18913a I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
you have I also believe there are people
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh representatives from the Department
 
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services that can
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
speak more eloquently than myself um to
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
the offense of human trafficking and
 
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
what other steps DHHS is taking in
 
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
recognition of the serious offense um
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
being part of our
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
state thank you very much Miss Benton uh
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
committee uh of attorney
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
Fenton Mr
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
chair who up
 
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:16.760 align:start position:0%

00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
are thanks very much Mr chair and uh and

hear your voice and um and uh just a
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
just a question as it relates to the the
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
statute uh over and above the um uh the
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
list of um of criminal activity that
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
you've put in that in that memo is it
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
true that um that school administrators
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
or or School boards can um Can can
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
disqualify somebody for um for any other
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors or felonies that they see
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:11:59.670 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors or felonies that they see
fit

00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
fit
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
yes you are correct so the list that's
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
contained in RSA
 
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.030 align:start position:0%
contained in RSA
18913a

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
18913a
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
is consistent across the board if you
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
will it's applicable to every school
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
district it's saying that as a state we
 
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
as a state do not want individuals with
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
these types of offenses to serve as
 
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
teachers but you are correct
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative luno that each individual
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
District can make a choice to add to
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
that list so if you um you know the way
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
my mind works RSA
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
18913a is similar to the Federal
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution it is the floor of
 
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
protection um districts individual
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
districts are like the state
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
constitution they can be more protective
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
but not less what the what the
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
department is seeking is really kind of
 
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
a statement to say across the state we
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't want this offense of human
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
trafficking to be in our schools we want
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
that to be consistent with uh throughout
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
the state we don't want that to be
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
discretionary thank you for the question
 
00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
no thank you very much Miss Venton are
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%

00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any hands up and
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
not hearing in this room um this
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%

which would be our technical support
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education and we
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%

we've done a lot to help Career Tech Ed
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
in the last few years we've allowed
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
concurrent dual enrollment to work in

Manchester have ninth grade kids
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
participating in that we've allowed our

instructors in the CTE Center an
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
alternate pathway where they can uh
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
receive uh credentialing to instruct in
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
a CTE Center without having to jump some
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
of the hurdles that those that are in a

commission for the state along with
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
folks from the business industry
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
Association Along with folks
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
representing doe repres those small
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
business and other
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
legislators for several years we've been
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
grappling with how we fund tuition and
 
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
transportation the recent study
 
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
committee on the commission for
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
Education funding also grappled with
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
this CTE monies as with special
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
education Aid the old cat Aid building
 
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
Aid um is a categorical grant for
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
funding it's separate from adequacy
 
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
although uh CTE if you look at the what
 
00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
the indicators are for the delivery of
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
an adequate education of those
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
indicators three of which are ones that
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
deal directly with the number of
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
students that and the percentage of
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
students which are participating in CTE
 
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
programs and onto skill Pathways which
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
are going to reinforce our
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
Workforce so with that I'd like to to
 
00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
get into a little of the specifics on
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
this we will have Eric fur worth from
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education the director
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
of CTE speaking following myself um we
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
are we are asking that we set up a
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
commission a committee to for the
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of looking at this more
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
thoroughly um and understanding that
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
for uh CTE centers to function excuse
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
me the actual Transportation cost for
 
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
school districts to send kids to a CTE
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
Center roughly around $2.6
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
million they get reimbursed through our
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
formula approximately $680,000 you can
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
see there's a huge cost laid down on our
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
school districts to get kids to the CTE
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
centers that often times results in
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
certain districts capping the number of
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
students which can participate in this
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
very important skill opportunity and so
 
00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
it's really the opportunity to acquire
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
this end of CTE program is not
 
00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:05.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily available to all students it
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
based upon in one several instances the
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
availability of transportation to and
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
from we also then have the issue of
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
tuition of the $9 million we uh send or
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
use for CTE tuition and transportation
 
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
after you deduct the the transportation
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
costs which are at 10 cents a mile which
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
is a very low figure to be reimbursing
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
to send a bus from where I live in havil
 
00:32:38.629 --> 00:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
naire to our CTE Center which is located
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
in Bradford Vermont there are a number
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
of CTE centers along the Connecticut
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
River that service both sides of the
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
river so there the tuition um amount is
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
also an area where we need to be looking
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
at in terms of is the tuition money
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
going to be available to a district
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
which has their own CTE Center within
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
for example if I'm in Plymouth New
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or Manchester New Hampshire
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
and we have a CTE centers in both of
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
those districts they're not going to get
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
any funding for tuition however if I'm
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
in holderness New Hampshire just outside
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
the parameter of Plymouth holderness
 
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
will receive tuition money for the
 
00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
centers the centers are are indeed a h a
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
a future for our education programming
 
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
and we need to really take a careful
 
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
look at that uh we were unable to do it
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
during the commission study um it's time
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
that we resolve this matter sit down and
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
figure out where we're going to go with
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
many of these issues another issue is
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
that we have 28 CTE of which they get
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
funding for Capital Improvements one a
 
00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:57.509 align:start position:0%
funding for Capital Improvements one a
year

00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
and by the time you get to that 28th
 
00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
year the equipment they have is largely
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
outdated they get support from the
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
business indust industry Association
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
various automobile associations and the
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
culinary arts and you name it they they
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
provide it and it's something we need to
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
take a look at so I I request that we
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
consider this bill move forward with the
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
concept of having a committee study to
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
really come back with some of these
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
answers we need regarding career Technic
 
00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:34.630 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.629 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
chairman I will uh relinquish the chair
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
and turn it back over to uh chairman
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
lad thank you very much got that without
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
getting out on my
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
seat so the next next person I'd like to
 
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
invite to testify would be Eric forworth
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education Eric
 
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
you with us
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
um point of order Mr chair yes yeah are
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
you going to be taking
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
questions pardon me are you going to be
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
taking I would prefer not to take
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
questions um to expedite this long I
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
think that any any question to me is
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
also G to be be able to be answered by
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
Eric well um I I think there may be a
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
question with with regards to
 
00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:25.270 align:start position:0%
question with with regards to
legislative

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
intent that I think that I think you may
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
be in the best position to answer go
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
ahead and ask your question represent
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
Luna actually um I'm I'm happy to do it
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
but I um there may be others that

are Mel do you want me to do it yeah
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah actually Rick not to be
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
technical here you should not be in the
 
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
chair right
 
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
now uh represent cordelli should still
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
be chairing because you're going to be
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
answering questions as the maker of the
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
well okay I I don't want to be technical
 
00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
here but I think the technical okay
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
repesent cordelli is now chairing this
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
meeting I'm still sitting in the center
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
chair my same
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
chair go ahead I'm
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
sorry so so I'll I'll I'll I'll take it
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um um Mr chair I was
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
just wondering um how this bill will uh
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
will address um uh how members will be
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
committee the uh if that's to myself
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
here the on on the committee uh
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
membership the members of the committee

intent that the appointments will be
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
proportional to um to party membership
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%

sure that they will make a decision
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
which AFF Forge both parties to
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
participate um I was hoping that may
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
have been done with the commission for
 
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
studying funding of Education which were
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
seven elected officials and there's one
 
00:37:59.790 --> 00:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
elected Republican I'd like to see that
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
reversed on this committee so that we
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
have participation coming in from both
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
sides well if if I might I'd also say
 
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
that the uh that the governor had uh had
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
an appointment and um and other
 
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
appointments were made uh from the from
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
public members that uh that I don't
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
believe were all members of the same
 
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.750 align:start position:0%
believe were all members of the same
party

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%

00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
everybody on this education committee we
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
all believe in CTE programming we all
 
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
recognize we have to do something to
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
improve how we fund
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
CTE we need to improve so much Capital
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
Improvement and and for the development
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
of these and there is a task force
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
working at the Department of Education
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
now but but we need to also educate and
 
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
inform our public educate and inform
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
legislators educate and inform schools
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh counselors educate uh leadership
 
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
within the school community that CTE is
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
not what our fathers and grandfathers
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
once knew it to be CTE is now taking
 
00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
graphic design computer technology it's
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
into agricultural aspects it's in
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
automotive mechanics and Automotive uh
 
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
technology it's a huge field as you all
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
know we cannot wait we need to really do
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
something uh and move forward with the
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
idea that CTE programming is a a option
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
for students to consider we need to get
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
out of this old channel that you got to
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
go to a four-year
 
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
school this we have too many
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities with a two plus two
 
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
program we have too many opportunities
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
where you can come out with skill
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
certificate and a pathway which will
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
lead to you lead you towards a job and
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
productivity in our state and keep folks
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
here so um I went a little bit beyond on
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
answering your question uh I cannot tell
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
you what the speaker would do or the
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
president but I know the speaker I know
 
00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
this this speaker would definitely try
 
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
to get folks from both sides and the the
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate has been there
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
before and all the times I've seen him
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
Senator Morris
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh put folks on to various committees
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
he's done it uh trying to get
 
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
representative representation from both
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
sides thank you Mr chair I've got a
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
question uh yes representative Miler uh
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
Rick I I don't disagree with anything
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
you you just have said because this is
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
an important issue no question about it
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
but I've been informed that the the
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate has basically
 
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
said that any they will not deal with
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
any committee or Commission
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
coming out of this legislative session
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
have you heard that I mean is that how
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
does that statement relate to creating
 
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
question I would like to say that we
 
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
need to move forward with this
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
legislation we need to inform all folks
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
that this is important I believe a
 
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
committee can function we have a job
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
that was started in uh the committee
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
with commission which represent luno
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
initiated this last year and went
 
00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
through summer and fall um we need to
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
continue that we need to with the the
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
this is also coming out of the Career
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
Technical education advisory commission
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
um plus when you have the next person
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to speak Eric ask him you
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
know can we hold off on this any further
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
we cannot we can't afford it you know
 
00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
this may not net us exactly what we want
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
but this will net us the opportunity to
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
let our public know that we need to move
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
on this topic and hopefully some good
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
legislation can come out of this
 
00:42:10.589 --> 00:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
committee study so your your leg your
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
your leadership then uh your Republican
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
leadership has not indicated to you the
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
issue of commissions or committees come
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh being authorized that that's okay or
 
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
is that not okay it's just a procedural
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
question I'm really asking I'm I'm not
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
debating the merits of the of the
 
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
proposal here because I think I would
 
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
support that but I'm just concerned
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
about how it's going to go forward and
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
how it's going to be received I will
 
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
work work very diligently to work with
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
the people on both sides of the wall uh
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's some issues that we need to come
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
together as a group here there's some
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
issues which are not political issues
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
this is one of those this is about as
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
youve said representative Myer many
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
times our
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
kids and this one right here is that
 
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
that's how we need to persuade all to
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
get off this political divide and to
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
work together towards this common end
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any further
 
00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.079 align:start position:0%
questions may I uh representative bum
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you this bill after we pass
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
it if it gets passed by the house we'll
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
go to the Senate right and the Senate
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
can then make the changes they need to
 
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.510 align:start position:0%
can then make the changes they need to
make

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
correct well that's the that's the I I
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%

running a meeting uh yes yes uh that is
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
Education and uh thank you I am uh
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
speaking definitely in favor of the
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
creation of this commit
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh I believe rep lad uh gave a very good
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
picture of what our challenges with
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
regard to tuition and
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
transportation and uh we have just
 
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
completed um an an equitable uh access
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
study uh through a consultant looking at
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh students ability to access CTE across
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and
 
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
transportation consistently Rose to the
 
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
surface as one of the challenges as to
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
why students are not uh participating in
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
CTE at the level that uh which com uh
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
comparable States uh have participation
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
in um and although you know
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
geographically I understand that we are
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
different than Delaware uh we like to
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
utilize them as a comparison because of
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh size and scope uh and their access to
 
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
a similar amount of Perkins money uh we
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
have about 15% of our eligible high
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
school students particip ating in CTE
 
00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
they have 65% of their eligible students
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
participating in
 
00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:37.559 align:start position:0%
CTE uh and so just at that level um
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
figuring out a way to increase our
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
transportation and tuition availability
 
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
for our students would open the door for
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
a larger much larger percentage of
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
students to participate uh and so rather
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
than you know throwing numbers and
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
statistic at you I would be happy to to
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
open up to questions anyone might have
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
about where the benefit of this
 
00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh where I see the benefit of
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
this committee would
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
be are there any questions from members
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
committee I don't yes which represent
 
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
Woodside thank you represent lad
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
uh Mr rorth just a question on um CTE
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
across the state is there a uh specific
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
course or curricula that required for
 
00:46:28.589 --> 00:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
all CTE to offer or is it each one
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
decided by their The Local School uh no
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you there is no requirement of
 
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
what is offered at each school they are
 
00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:39.079 align:start position:0%
uh locally developed uh each Center is
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
required to have uh a regional advisory
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee made up of representes from
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
each of the school districts as well as
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
the key business Industries in the area
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
with the intent of developing industry
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh CTE programs to fill the need for the
 
00:46:55.549 --> 00:46:55.559 align:start position:0%
industry in that region with the intent
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
that students will complete the program
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
and stay in their area to support the
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
local economy thank you very much Mr
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%

move forward in the executive session I
 
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
would like to entertain a motion from
 
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.470 align:start position:0%
would like to entertain a motion from
representative

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you Mr chairman I would
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
like to move on to pass on House Bill
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
304 second is there a
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
second representative B seconds that
 
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
represent represent B SE is that motion
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
discussion yeah repr B yeah just a a
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
point for transportation and hopefully
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
the committee will discuss
 
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation within the district I
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
know this came up last time where it's
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
easier for me for student in Lichfield
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
the shorter distance to go to Alber for
 
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:45.710 align:start position:0%
the shorter distance to go to Alber for
the

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
CTE or even to Manchester for a CTE
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
course then somebody in Manchester on
 
00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
the West Side traveling across the city
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
in a whole lot shorter time and and
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
districts probably so hopefully one of
 
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:05.720 align:start position:0%
the things hopefully the committee will
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
discuss is in District
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
transportation thank you are there
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
further any further
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
discussion Mr chair representative luno
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair um yeah you
 
00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
you referenced the the commission to
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
study school funding and and its work in
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
the CTE and you and I worked on that um
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
significantly too and I I I absolutely
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
um you know plan to support this
 
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
legislation I do think it's something
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
that comes from the comes out of the
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
commission recommendations but but um
 
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
but I also feel strongly that um that
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
the committee should indicate what uh
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
what you said in your remarks as regards
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
to the proportional representation of
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
the membership uh appointed to the
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
commission so I think as long as the
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
committee report includes
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
um uh statements to that effect and we
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
can have your um confirmation of that
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
then then I would certainly um lend my U
 
00:50:08.109 --> 00:50:08.119 align:start position:0%
wholehearted support behind um this um
 
00:50:08.119 --> 00:50:09.470 align:start position:0%
wholehearted support behind um this um
this

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you uh I don't want to speak
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
a whole lot on the bill because I did
 
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
present it but uh the my intent that
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
what I said should be reflected in our
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
record in the committee report in the
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
committee report that's correct thank

think we're in a good spot the only
 
00:56:19.029 --> 00:56:19.039 align:start position:0%
thing I wonder is if someone wants to

00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
how does that well they if they're an
 
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.549 align:start position:0%
how does that well they if they're an
attendee

00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
attendee
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
see them you can scroll through the list
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
and say okay I see some folks that we
 
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
don't have any card or any information
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
on and doesn't say that they don't want
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
they didn't sign earlier so I've been
 
00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:40.039 align:start position:0%
writing down all the attendees I haven't
 
00:56:40.039 --> 00:56:41.190 align:start position:0%
writing down all the attendees I haven't
been

00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:43.870 align:start position:0%
matching I was doing it
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:52.430 align:start position:0%
matching I was doing it
[Music]

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
more found one here okay they were told
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
that if they wanted to speak they had
 
00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
to sign
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%

00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%

00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
the next school year and before the
 
01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
number of special education students and
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
Associated services are actually
 
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
known I think many of you have
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
experienced the situation where you're
 
01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:23.559 align:start position:0%
in a school district and during the
 
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
course of a year you have students
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
arrive from another uh local that have a
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
significant severe handicapping
 
01:01:32.829 --> 01:01:32.839 align:start position:0%
condition that
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
requires uh special education services
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
that qualify for the old catastrophic
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
Aid or special education
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
Aid where does the money come from well
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
that's an issue because our the money is
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
course we're talking about money in the
 
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
preceding year that the budgets are
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
based upon but the formula states that
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
the the first three and a half times the
 
01:01:59.309 --> 01:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
average cost per pupil in the state and
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
let's say roughly the average cost of a
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
pupil in the state is $116,000 make a
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
figure up it's close to that and so the
 
01:02:10.029 --> 01:02:10.039 align:start position:0%
district will have to multiply that
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
figure by three and a half times before
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
they got any aid from the state of New
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire up to 10 times that amount the
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
the district will kind uh the state will
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
kick in between three and a half And1
 
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
times 80% of those costs and the the the
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
school district uh chips in the 20%
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
beyond that the state pays for this is a
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
significant burden on um school
 
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:45.799 align:start position:0%
districts and the issue uh this is
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
another issue which uh we discussed this
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
previous year in terms of uh categorical
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
Aid the special education the building
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
CTE programs and uh struggled and and
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
and of course it really wasn't
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
underneath the area of adequacy it adey
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
has differentiated Aid in it which is
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
Special Ed but it doesn't take in
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
account this level of funding which is
 
01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
necessary I want to give you an example
 
01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
here I'll go back to the issue of a
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
$166,000 up to three and a half times so
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
the school district would have to pay
 
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
$56,000 before the state started kicking
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
in if the costs of this student were
 
01:03:32.119 --> 01:03:34.190 align:start position:0%
in if the costs of this student were
roughly

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
$99,000 you would take that
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
$56,000 and subtract it from the 99 you
 
01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:41.559 align:start position:0%
come out with
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
$443,000 that is above that three and a
 
01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:45.750 align:start position:0%
$443,000 that is above that three and a
half

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
half
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
times the state is responsible paying
 
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
80% of the cost above the special ed
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
education cap so if the take the the 10
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
the 80% out which would be out of the 43
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:04:04.269 --> 01:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
34,400 the the local is going to have to
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
capture another
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
$8,600 so the total cost for this
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
student to the Local District for a
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
student that has um a need for $999,000
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
the program The District would have to
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
kick in about $64,500
 
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
that is you know not necessarily in all
 
01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:26.839 align:start position:0%
those budgets and so they don't have a
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund which they can delve back
 
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
into so one of the concepts I was
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
looking at earlier and I've expressed it
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
to the commission before that what
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
happens if we drop this amount uh down
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
to two and a half times so if you take
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
two and a half and multiply that by 16
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
you come up with a bottom line of um uh
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
subtracting the of the uh it would be
 
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
$40,000 subtracting that from the 59 and
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
you end up with um the state's portion
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
would actually be a $
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
47,2 I bottom line of all this there
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
would be a savings to the district if we
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
bounced it back to two and a half of
 
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.990 align:start position:0%
bounced it back to two and a half of
$12,800

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
$12,800
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
but there's more to this story if the
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
state appropriates only X number dollars
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
and we back it off to two and a half
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to be probably enrolling
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
engaging more students that qualify for
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
cat a there could be another thousand
 
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
kids and so if we appropriate the same
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
amount of dollar we're just going to
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
sprinkle that money all over and would
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
be less support for these kids so this
 
01:05:38.109 --> 01:05:38.119 align:start position:0%
again is another issue it's a it's issue
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
which has to be
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
addressed um this bill is it's been
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
presented more of a
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
placeholder and hoping that we wouldn't
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
be in the middle of this uh coid which
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
is you know constricting what we're able
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
able to do and what we're not able to do
 
01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
but this is an issue that also needs a
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
lot of work there are we are working on
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment that could be possibly put
 
01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
into this bill which would allow and and
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
move us
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
towards um a an insurance pool where all
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
the school districts in the state would
 
01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
enter into an insurance pool and you
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
would have an insurance premium which
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
would help pay for these kids and so
 
01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have these unexpected costs
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
hitting you but that's a huge huge issue
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
we have some of the work already done on
 
01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
that working with the Department of
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
Education uh and I'm hoping that we
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
could probably get something together
 
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
within the next few weeks to try even to
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
amend this bill so and to shut this off
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
and be concluding our where we are as
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
it's written right now there is a
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
possible savings a good savings on the
 
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
state would have to kick and it's taking
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
the money and shifting it from the local
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
state that's a good thing if you're on
 
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
the local school board um then the state
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
has to determine okay where are they
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
going to find the money for these
 
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
additional costs that's where we are but
 
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at from policy
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
consideration districts are struggling
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
with CAD Aid this is one way that we can
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
start that discussion and in fact if we
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
follow through in this there will be
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
some savings to districts thank you very
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
much for the opport to speak thank you
 
01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
uh do we have any questions for the
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
chairman represent
 
01:07:37.269 --> 01:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
t uh thank you uh chairman um I am all
 
01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:41.799 align:start position:0%
for uh this bill uh giving the local
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayer a break on special education my
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
only concern is I and I'm not I would
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
have to really do some research on it
 
01:07:55.269 --> 01:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
but uh it seems like the state set sets
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
Caps or sets caps on pockets of money
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
that's used for special education and if
 
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
um if more people apply for it more
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
local districts apply for it uh and the
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
money isn't there it's then distributed
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
on a percentage basis um is that what's
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
going to happen with
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
this is that to
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
me what you described uh represent
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
Tanner is exactly what's happening with
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education as well you
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
know we often times say you're going to
 
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
get 70% of this but actuality it might
 
01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.070 align:start position:0%
get 70% of this but actuality it might
be

01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
56% um what we need to do here is if we
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
recog I'm I'm addressing this one from a
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
a policy focus a policy perspective and
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
I I think it is good policy that we um
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
look at where where the state is where
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
the federal government is on this and
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
they're contributing basically 35% the
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
65% is on your local district and for a
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
small District that they just can't
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
survive like that uh I had a small
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
District right next door to us in havil
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's called permont they had two
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid students enroll in one
 
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
year and it basically drove them under
 
01:09:14.669 --> 01:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
and what it ends up doing they have to
 
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
fund that they either take out a tax
 
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
anticipation note or they subtract
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
dollars allocated to other operational
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
services within the facility which often
 
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
times is curriculum and instruction and
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
to support this program the dollars have
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
to come from somewhere so uh from a
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
policy perspective I understand what
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying but I also see there is an
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
opportunity if this is properly
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
administered and if we have the funding
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
there then we're going to alleviate some
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
of the B burden for these smaller
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
districts and on Manchester as
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
well followup on that
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
please you you move a little closer to
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
the um M volume was a little bit low on
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
our end
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
here could I have a followup yes follow
 
01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
up uh thank you C uh representative
 
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
cordellia it's a little bit hard to hear
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
you sometimes I don't know if it's hard
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
to hear me yeah um but I just want to
 
01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that I made my point and that
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
the point was that um the state can
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
still cap the amount of money that
 
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to spend so even though
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
we're down upshifting which I think is a
 
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
great idea and I thoroughly um support
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
the insurance pool but um if if this is
 
01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
upshifting and the state still puts a
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
cap on everything it doesn't necessarily
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
mean that the local um the local people
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
will get more money uh and also um I
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to just say that the LBA hasn't
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
given us a fiscal note on this as
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.229 align:start position:0%
given us a fiscal note on this as
well

01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
is that to me yeah I think that was to
 
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
you yes I I and follow up to this uh
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner I spoke with the uh
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Education yesterday
 
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
regarding that they're working on this
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
they really are having a difficult time
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
trying to identify so if we drop it to
 
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
two and a half times how many students
 
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
now start uh are caught and eligible for
 
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
some of the state funding that's what
 
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
they're trying to figure out um and I I
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
understand they're going to have that
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
information for us here within the next
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
week or so so um once again uh this is a
 
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
bill that I I think that we just need to
 
01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
introduce and hold it until we can you
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
know get more information and then do
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
what we need to do with it
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
later thank
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
you yeah represent may you have a
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
question yes I'm wondering about whether
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
there's any uh provision in this bill or
 
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
consideration of the assessment of the
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
efficacy of this
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
instruction even and the present funding
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
I support the idea of additional funding
 
01:12:13.149 --> 01:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
I recognize there's a need for it but
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
when I look at what the results are I
 
01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
don't see any data that says any outside
 
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
professional has assessed whether or not
 
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
it the schools seem to be doing their
 
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
own assessment and
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
then somehow people graduate who don't
 
01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
perform at the level of other people and
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
that concerns
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
me if that's a question to me
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative Ford um the the students
 
01:12:44.629 --> 01:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here uh in the state
 
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
approximately that have re eligible for
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
about 800 students these are students
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
that are done through the IEP process
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
and many of them are in these facilities
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
as a result of professionals above and
 
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
beyond the school district making those
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosis um yes I agree that
 
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
accountability for all the programs uh
 
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
is an issue uh Department of Education
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is I'll say it underst
 
01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
staffed in many of these departments and
 
01:13:17.629 --> 01:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
needs that support in a uh in terms of
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
staff to have it and also we as a
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
legislator legislature have to give them
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
the authority to get some accountability
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with Federal legislation
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
as well the idea and um that's a pretty
 
01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
big act to
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
tackle thank you
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
um I see representative luno has
 
01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
question for representative I believe
 
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
thank thank you very much Mr chair and
 
01:13:47.709 --> 01:13:47.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um representative
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
lad for for taking my question um as you
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
know U special education was a was a
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
significant part of the um of the
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
commission to study school funding's um
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
work and um and I I I guess what what um
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
what I want to ask you about
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
particularly is in the context of the um
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
of the commission's uh final report and
 
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations they talk about um
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
significant changes to data collection
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
done by the department that would um
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
that would probably make it um easier
 
01:14:30.189 --> 01:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
for the Department to to evaluate the
 
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal cost of of this type of policy
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if you could um talk
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit about what the um what the
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
department is doing right now in order
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
to um to to arrive at a um at a fiscal
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
note and then I guess the second part of
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
my question also stemming back to the um
 
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
to the commission's report is uh
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if this Bill U um talks about
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
modifying the determination year of the
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
special education Aid because as you
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
know it follows um it comes a year late
 
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
which um when when when looking at um at
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
um uh High um needs students can uh can
 
01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
still put tremendous budgetary pressure
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
on um school districts so thanks very
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
much representative Vlad and and I'll
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
just I'll try to answer that briefly
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
here for you represent luno we do have
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh an individual from the Department of
 
01:15:30.669 --> 01:15:30.679 align:start position:0%
Education that was like to speak and
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
from special education and some of your
 
01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
questions might be best sent
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
there you know asked in a few moments
 
01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you acting chair
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative lad thanks for taking my
 
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
question just um I'm trying to uh learn
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
some of these review the bills via uh
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
the internet versus hard copy makes it
 
01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
more difficult for me to keep noting but
 
01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
I didn't see specifically any place
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
where you identified in the Bill's
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
language the insurance pool I heard you
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
speak about the insurance pool a minute
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
ago so my question was as regards the
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
insurance pool where would that money
 
01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
from this this is a proposed amendment
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
that has not been fully developed right
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
now representative Woodcock um it's uh
 
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
been worked with for the last year and a
 
01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
half and on and off uh the uh Commission
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
of education's aware of it school
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
districts are certainly aware of it and
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
very supportive of trying to set up some
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
kind of an insurance pool much like your
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
sick La Bank you might have within a
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
school district for employees they can
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
borrow from the bank to and and they
 
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
contribute to the bank so that that's a
 
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
positive thing so I I do have in front
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
of me uh some of that proposed language
 
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh but there's a lot to it
 
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock that we need
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
further definition on as far as uh um
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know some kind of a cost estimator
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
legal indemnification issues um uh
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
process to determine eligible insurance
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
carriers available for the pool um uh
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
these are types of fiscal things that
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
have yet to be developed where still in
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
the discussion stages and quite frankly
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
it it may be premature to be putting
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
something like this forward unless we
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
have all those answers and um there are
 
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
some folks out in the hinterland in the
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
districts are just so excited about
 
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
possibly going this they like to see it
 
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
happen yesterday um to help them with
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
the the cost of this this one area of
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
education so um you're correct there's
 
01:17:53.629 --> 01:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
you haven't seen anything I haven't seen
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
some of it I've seen the purpose
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
statements I've seen um how the pool
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
pool might work uh much the policy stuff
 
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
but as far as the fiscal management and
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
the business aspects of it I haven't so
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
my hopes are up but I I since I honestly
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
think that to do all this within the
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
next two and a half three weeks is is is
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
like climbing Mount
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
Everest uh 10 times over so um the only
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
thing that this bill does is Scratch Out
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
3.5 and put 2.5 in
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative that that
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
that eases my mind because I couldn't
 
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
find it on in text and I didn't have a
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
hard copy thank you you're
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
welcome if there no further questions
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
01:18:46.719 --> 01:18:48.629 align:start position:0%
for representative
lad

01:18:48.629 --> 01:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
lad
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
excuse okay there
 
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.629 align:start position:0%
excuse okay there
was

01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
yeah um there was a question from the uh
 
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
viewing public U The Honorable Dan mire
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
I believe has a question for
 
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.189 align:start position:0%
I believe has a question for
representative

01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
lad uh thank you Mr chairman um not
 
01:19:10.629 --> 01:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
specifically for representative lad I
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to testify on the bill maybe I
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
don't know the procedure quite right
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
there's so many questions uh I this is a
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
point of order from myself uh I don't
 
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
believe uh a person that's testifying
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
can be asked a question by a
 
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.350 align:start position:0%
can be asked a question by a
non-committee

01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
non-committee
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
member I would
 
01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.149 align:start position:0%
member I would
agree

01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:19:32.159 --> 01:19:38.950 align:start position:0%
agree
Sor

01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
soor um we'll move on uh to the next um
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
person who wants to testify and I'll
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
turn the Reigns back over to Chairman L
 
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represent Cordell
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to invite to the uh meeting
 
01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
right now uh Rebecca Wilson from New
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
Association good morning chairman Laden
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
committee members thanks for allowing me
 
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
to speak today sorry for the it took a
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
minute for me to get promoted here to
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
it's always nice to feel promoted so uh
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Becky Wilson and I am the
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
director of governmental relations for
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school boards
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
Association and we are in support of HB
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
613 and its current proposed form I
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
realized there's some discussion about
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
some amendments and things like that and
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
I will try not to be repetitive or
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
redundant because several of the points
 
01:20:49.390 --> 01:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
that we were going to discuss today have
 
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
already been talked about but certainly
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh one one of our longstanding
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
resolutions that's adopted by our
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
members and continually reaffirmed uh is
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
to reduce the threshold for determining
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
the local share of special costs uh to
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
two times the state average uh for the
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
general education cost and while 613 as
 
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
written doesn't completely get us down
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
to that desired threshold it certainly
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
is a strong positive step towards that
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
goal uh and to Chairman lad's Point
 
01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
earlier uh these costs certainly
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh would assist meeting the needs of our
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
most vulner vulnerable students in our
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
districts and allow um some of those
 
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
costs to be defrayed directly from those
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh over those lowi incidents
 
01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
disabilities um as we're aware across
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
the state special ed funding is
 
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
certainly a resource that is in very
 
01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:43.719 align:start position:0%
short supply and districts are obligated
 
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure that our students receive the
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
special ed services supports and
 
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
placements that they need to succeed
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
educationally in the least restrictive
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
environment and for some some students
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
that means creating some very um
 
01:21:58.590 --> 01:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
intensive needs programs within their
 
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
district and for some students that
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
means going outside of the district to
 
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
look for specially approved programs for
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
these students uh regardless districts
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
have to meet those obligations
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of and without consideration
 
01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:13.639 align:start position:0%
of the cost we are putting the students
 
01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
first in terms of what their needs are
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh Schoolboard budgets can be stretched
 
01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
by the Intensive educational needs
 
01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
placements and programs and merited
 
01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes midyear um by changes in a
 
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
family's District of residence or by
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
changes in student need after the
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
budgets have been approved so providing
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
any additional reimbursement through
 
01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:37.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill 613 would provide schools
 
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
with much Aid and particularly again to
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
Chairman lad's Point our smaller
 
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
districts where Sometimes some
 
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
unanticipated uh placements or programs
 
01:22:49.149 --> 01:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
can cost far beyond even the three and a
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
half uh times the estimated per pupil
 
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.310 align:start position:0%
half uh times the estimated per pupil
expenditure

01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
um we have had some placements for
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
students that can cost upwards of
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
$300,000 per year um and for some
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
districts even our larger districts that
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
is a very high cost to incur um so we
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
certainly would uh support HB 613 and
 
01:23:11.709 --> 01:23:11.719 align:start position:0%
additional state aid for these costs as
 
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
districts continue to meet their
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
obligations to students and I'm happy to
 
01:23:17.229 --> 01:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
take any questions from the committee
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%

whether the town withdraw or not and
 
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
this is relevant because it made people
 
01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
in the five towns that are in the
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
district actually start talking about
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
education funding it was vicious and
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
polarizing there were neighbor against
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
neighbor Town against town but they all
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
agreed on one thing that special
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
education costs are a burden they feel
 
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
like all these regulations are coming in
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
from other places and uh there's no
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
check attached to that so here are all
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
these other things that you need to do
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
and there's no funding behind it so even
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
people that spend a good portion of
 
01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
every day attacking each other we're
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
unified on this issue and that's
 
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
important um it isn't like an interest
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
group came together and they gathered
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
support and we got a bunch of names
 
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
these were folks who did not want to
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
agree with each other yet they did on
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
I am not a math Wizard and I trust my
 
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
good friend your chairman to come up
 
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
with numbers but what I'm asking the
 
01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
committee is do something um everyone
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
agrees on this when you have a child
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
move into the district that has an i AP
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
or that has special needs attached to
 
01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:13.719 align:start position:0%
them that cost the district money this
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
is really disruptive um sometimes it can
 
01:25:17.229 --> 01:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
involve a higher there has to be a
 
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
one-on-one par so this bill is a great
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
step forward I don't know if it's the
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
answer but that isn't the point the
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
point is that we do something so the
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
education committee as a policy matter
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
can pass this bill or whatever amended
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
version you come up with and set the
 
01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
policy that the state does indeed need
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
to do more so I guess I'll just leave
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
you with please do something please do
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%

we'll keep this pretty short and sweet I
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
did send you testimony
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
electronically um in representing these
 
01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
small towns uh in the rural rural part
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
of the State uh I constantly hear about
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
the problems that our select boards and
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
Boards of Education have in meeting the
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh requirements and and financial
 
01:26:46.639 --> 01:26:48.270 align:start position:0%
uh requirements and and financial
obligations

01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
for uh education in especially special
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
education students and so I feel very
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
strongly that this bill um will be very
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
very helpful um by lowering the
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
threshold from three and a half to two
 
01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
and a half we we're going to increase
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
the amount of state aid available for
 
01:27:11.229 --> 01:27:11.239 align:start position:0%
these school districts uh and for the
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
costs of these special education
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
students and so I cannot add any more to
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
what's already been said and I don't
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
want to take up any more of your time
 
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
but I do hope that you will support this
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
and pass it through and and get some
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
much needed relief from the state uh to
 
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
our smaller towns and even our bigger
 
01:27:32.189 --> 01:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
towns and
 
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities but um specifically my
 
01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:37.639 align:start position:0%
small towns they need some help so and I
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
hope you can do it thank you thank you
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
very much representative Aaron uh Ron
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
Hobson do we have any other folks that
 
01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:49.719 align:start position:0%
are up for Testimony no so we're down
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
through our list uh of folks how many
 
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
people did we have signed up on on that
 
01:27:58.750 --> 01:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
bill see I can go down through the list
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
here we had uh let's see one two three
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
four people testifying in support nobody
 
01:28:11.109 --> 01:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
testifying against it um we have a total
 
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
of 1 two 3 four five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
 
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
total people that signed up uh uh
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill uh of the those uh
 
01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill uh of the those uh
we

01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
had all but one
 
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
supporting so I will conclude
 
01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.750 align:start position:0%
supporting so I will conclude
this

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
me Mr chair excuse we will take question
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
is there one in the attendee list yes we
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
have one person in the attendee list I
 
01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
intend to try and give some support
 
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
there um uh The Honorable
 
01:28:55.149 --> 01:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
hi Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Dan
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
Maguire um I was a representative from
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
2011 to 2016 as a member of the finance
 
01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:09.719 align:start position:0%
committee and my first term I dealt with
 
01:29:11.229 --> 01:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
uh education as one of the
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities on the finance
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
committee so I'm somewhat
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
familiar um with this area possibly out
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
of date uh but I I wanted to make two
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
comments um with regard to um
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative lad's testimony uh first
 
01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
of all he seems
 
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
to um think that somehow there's a
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
difference between local taxpayers and
 
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
state level taxpayers in the sense that
 
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
um unburdening one and and extra
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
burdening the other would make a
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
difference but in fact the two groups
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
are essentially the same groups of
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
people um the state does does not have a
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
magical you know Money Tree behind the
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
state house it's it's the same set of
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are paying both bills um local
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
taxes tend to be more noticeable because
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
people explicitly write two checks a
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
year uh whereas the r estate taxes are
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
paid invisibly through business
 
01:30:17.229 --> 01:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
transactions and and other things um so
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
you would think that this bill there
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
therefore is essentially a wash that you
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
know one set of you're you're taking
 
01:30:26.350 --> 01:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
from the left pocket instead of the
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
right pocket but that's not quite true
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
because the inevitable result of this
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
bill will be more spending on uh special
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
ed than there was previously and the
 
01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that this bill the
 
01:30:45.109 --> 01:30:45.119 align:start position:0%
people who make decisions about how much
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
spending there will be on special ed are
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
the local school districts and at least
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
my experience is that the state
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
department of education has essentially
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
zero oversight over that that the local
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
school districts just send a number to
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
to the state and and this is and the and
 
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
the state sends a check and so um when
 
01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
somebody else pays a a larger proportion
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
of your bill you're like more likely to
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
spend more than if you are paying that
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
proportion of your bill so the local
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
school districts who were paying X and
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
are now paying less than that are likely
 
01:31:28.109 --> 01:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
to spend more it's just human
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
nature all right the other thing I want
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
to talk about is that at least at the
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
time and well you can see it today is
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
that certain towns overuse this um this
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh program more than others certain
 
01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
towns are Big Spenders in this area
 
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
compared to others and after this
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
hearing is over I'll send you all a
 
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
current spreadsheet that shows this
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
total amount of money is roughly $30
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
million a year that the state sends to
 
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
towns and I'll show you how much each
 
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
Town gets and the and the calculation
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
and there are certain towns uh I'll name
 
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
three Bedford Dover and marac um which
 
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
are Big Spenders they get um uh much
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
more than half of what marac get what
 
01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester gets for example um they each
 
01:32:23.310 --> 01:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
get close to a million dollars of that
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
30 million uh Manchester gets about 1.6
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
million even though they're about a
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
quarter of the size of of Manchester if
 
01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.430 align:start position:0%
quarter of the size of of Manchester if
that

01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
so there are certain towns that that
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
spend a lot in this area and and
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
therefore this is not
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily an EV evenly distributed
 
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
program it's it's
 
01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
it's encourages big spend ERS in some
 
01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:55.400 align:start position:0%
sense and um so one suggestion I have
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
for you to improve this bill would be to
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
to allow the Department of Education to
 
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
do some oversight put in the bill that
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
you would hire four or six or some
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
number of Auditors and allow them to
 
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
actually audit the special ed spending
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
in those programs and try to get some
 
01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
kind of uniformity among the towns in
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
terms of their decision making because I
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
think that would overall spend save
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
money and um therefore you could
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
increase uh the amount of of um
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
percentage that the state spends without
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily causing the state to
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
actually spend more more dollars if you
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
see what I mean so thank you very much
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
01:33:43.629 --> 01:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh honorable Maguire
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
Dan not see any hands raised uh thank
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
you very much for your
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
testimony um at this point in time we
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
have no further people in the queue is
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
that correct so I'm going to close this
 
01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh we will enter into the
 
01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
last hearing set for this morning which
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
will be HB
 
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
513 relative to the degree granting
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
authority of Signum University and
 
01:34:16.390 --> 01:34:16.400 align:start position:0%

sections so I went over the rubric I
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
looked at all the what the teacher asked
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
for and everything so I made sure did
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
everything that was asked
 
01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:09.189 align:start position:0%
everything that was asked

01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
paragraphs and he said yeah he said the
 
01:45:33.790 --> 01:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
teacher said that was a typographical
 
01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:35.390 align:start position:0%
teacher said that was a typographical
error

01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
error
 
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
something I said you
 
01:45:41.070 --> 01:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
write that teacher and you explained to
 
01:45:44.589 --> 01:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
him that you followed the written
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
assignment and you remind him that you
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
sent an email to him and said I can't
 
01:45:55.629 --> 01:45:55.639 align:start position:0%
find the assignment online and his
 
01:45:58.510 --> 01:45:58.520 align:start position:0%

extracurricular options for kids have
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
been limited during the pandemic and
 
02:05:14.589 --> 02:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
we've wanted to step in and help out
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
with that a week and a half ago our
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%

participation in the new learn

everywhere initiative and we're excited
 
02:05:28.189 --> 02:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
to give kids more fun options for
 
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:30.119 align:start position:0%

circumstances recently we've been
 
02:05:34.750 --> 02:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
working with one of our current students
 
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
to begin free book and writing clubs for

she works the program has sadly been put
 
02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
on hold for a while due to a coid
 
02:05:45.149 --> 02:05:45.159 align:start position:0%
outbreak in the main prisons but we're
 
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
hoping to move forward with that
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
initiative a few months down the road in
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
2018 Signum underwent a rigorous
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensive review before the higher
 
02:05:55.390 --> 02:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
education commission a committee as you
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
know consisting of many of the most
 
02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
distinguished higher education
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%

Hampshire University served as the chair
 
02:06:07.149 --> 02:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
of our evaluation committee the result
 
02:06:09.109 --> 02:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
of that review was a recommendation that
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
our ma program be approved in the state
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and the review team
 
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
provided as they always do a list of
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations that they wanted to see
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
us address in the following two years
 
02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
years prior to our first standard
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
follow-up review which was scheduled for
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
fall of 2020 the higher education
 
02:06:26.830 --> 02:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
commission approved our program
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
officially and unanimously in 2020 we
 
02:06:31.709 --> 02:06:31.719 align:start position:0%
officially began the next stage of our
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
credentialing process which is our
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
application for accreditation we're
 
02:06:37.149 --> 02:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
applying for accreditation from the
 
02:06:38.830 --> 02:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
distance education accrediting
 
02:06:40.830 --> 02:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
commission we have passed through the
 
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
first preliminary stage of the
 
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
accreditation review and we're currently
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
engaged in stage two we're hoping that
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
our accreditation review will be
 
02:06:51.549 --> 02:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
complete in either June 2021 or January
 
02:06:54.189 --> 02:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
2022 though the time frame is largely
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
out of our hands of course this past
 
02:07:00.109 --> 02:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
fall Dr gustofson uh requested an update
 
02:07:01.790 --> 02:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
on our progress towards that list of
 
02:07:03.629 --> 02:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations that the that the higher
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
education commission gave uh for us to
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
work on in preparation for our next
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
review the higher education commission
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
was so satisfied with our excellent
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
progress towards these goals that they
 
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
voted in October 2020 Again by unanimous
 
02:07:19.229 --> 02:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
vote to postpone our review our next
 
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
review our follow-up review to the fall
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
of 2021 extending our initial approval
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
period by a full year in that hearing Dr
 
02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
gustofson also testified that he had
 
02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
read our full set of accreditation
 
02:07:33.229 --> 02:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
materials and that he was confident that
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
we would receive a satisfactory review
 
02:07:37.629 --> 02:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
by from the accrediting board these are
 
02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
Signum credentials for the awarding of
 
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
degree granting status by the New
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature we've completed
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
every necessary step along the way and
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
we've been vetted and reviewed on
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions by those in whom the
 
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire has vested
 
02:07:52.549 --> 02:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
authority to evaluate the quality of
 
02:07:54.669 --> 02:07:54.679 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education we
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
remain in contact with the higher
 
02:07:57.990 --> 02:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
education commission and we're looking
 
02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
forward to a lifelong relationship with
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
that body as we undergo regular reviews
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
and evaluations from them every few
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
years as is right and as is stipulated
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
by law we embrace the accountability
 
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
that the that the higher education
 
02:08:14.109 --> 02:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
commission offers as they continue their
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
work of ensuring that higher education
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is held to a high
 
02:08:18.119 --> 02:08:20.470 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is held to a high
standard

02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:22.669 --> 02:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
at this time I feel I need to pause to
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
address a concern of which I've just
 
02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
recently been made aware it's come to my
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
attention that one of my communications
 
02:08:32.910 --> 02:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
from last January uh has been receiving
 
02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
some discussion and uh has seemed to
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
cause some consternation last January we
 
02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
were nearing the end of the house
 
02:08:42.030 --> 02:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
discussion of Signum previous Bill since
 
02:08:44.189 --> 02:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
there seemed still to be some
 
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings at the time I reached
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
out by email to Mr luno who is the most
 
02:08:50.990 --> 02:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
vocal of those opposed to the measure I
 
02:08:52.589 --> 02:08:52.599 align:start position:0%
proposed a meeting at which we could
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
discuss the issues together and perhaps
 
02:08:56.189 --> 02:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
come to a better understanding but I
 
02:08:58.589 --> 02:08:58.599 align:start position:0%
never received any resp response from
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
him in a hearing with the Senate
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
education committee a couple weeks ago
 
02:09:04.830 --> 02:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan informed me that Mr luno
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
had been offended by my email and that
 
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
Mr luno had thought its tone was
 
02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
threatening if this is the case I
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
certainly apologize I declared in my
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
email my intention of publicly rebutting
 
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
the statements that Mr luno had already
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
written into the public record as I felt
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
to be my duty my intention of course was
 
02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
to avoid any such public debates by
 
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
resolving things with a civilized
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
private discussion instead it was
 
02:09:29.790 --> 02:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
certainly never my intention to make
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
anyone feel uneasy that email came at
 
02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
the end of a long and frustrating series
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
of hearings and discussions and in
 
02:09:38.109 --> 02:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
retrospect I now realize it was perhaps
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
rather too intense in my Expressions if
 
02:09:43.069 --> 02:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
that made you feel uncomfortable Mr Leno
 
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
I'm very sorry for that to return to the
 
02:09:49.229 --> 02:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
main matter it is now 202 21 and we're
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
almost a year into the coid pandemic in
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
the last year remote learning and online
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
education have taken a central place in
 
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
our Educational Systems it is clear that
 
02:10:02.589 --> 02:10:02.599 align:start position:0%
good online education is imperative for
 
02:10:05.149 --> 02:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
the future of Education in America
 
02:10:07.229 --> 02:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
Signum has spent the last 10 years
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
pioneering a remote learning approach
 
02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
that makes excellence in teaching and
 
02:10:12.430 --> 02:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
learning available to students in New
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Beyond since April we've
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
been offering to assist teachers and
 
02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
institutions who have been undertak
 
02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
taking the difficult and sudden
 
02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
transition to remote learning brought on
 
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
by the circumstances of the pandemic we
 
02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
have run several mentoring sessions for
 
02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
teachers at multiple levels helping them
 
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
to work through the conversion of their
 
02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
teaching plans to the online medium
 
02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
recently I was approached by the
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
president of a small tribal College in
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
Minnesota he's been following Signum
 
02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
program so uh from afar uh and his
 
02:10:42.589 --> 02:10:42.599 align:start position:0%
college has been struggling to adapt to
 
02:10:44.830 --> 02:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
the pandemic circumstances he asked for
 
02:10:46.669 --> 02:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
my advice in helping them to rethink
 
02:10:48.549 --> 02:10:48.559 align:start position:0%
their whole pedagogical approach because
 
02:10:50.589 --> 02:10:50.599 align:start position:0%
he'd really like to have their college
 
02:10:52.589 --> 02:10:52.599 align:start position:0%
follow the model that Signum has
 
02:10:54.750 --> 02:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
developed we've begun working with them
 
02:10:56.549 --> 02:10:56.559 align:start position:0%
to assist them in their transition to a
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
more vibrant online teaching approach as
 
02:11:00.629 --> 02:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
they seek new and innovative ways to
 
02:11:02.109 --> 02:11:02.119 align:start position:0%
serve their students better and move
 
02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
forward into the 21st century it has
 
02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
been many years since a new institution
 
02:11:08.669 --> 02:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
of higher education has been formed in
 
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire ours is the
 
02:11:12.430 --> 02:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
first such Bill to come to the New
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature during the
 
02:11:16.549 --> 02:11:16.559 align:start position:0%
legislative careers of the vast majority
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
of its representatives and senators
 
02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
in this bill you have the opportunity to
 
02:11:22.669 --> 02:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
show that New Hampshire supports
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%
education and innovation in the last
 
02:11:27.310 --> 02:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
year Signum has already begun to be
 
02:11:29.709 --> 02:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
looked at by our peers as a viable model
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
for the future of higher education we
 
02:11:33.669 --> 02:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
are working hard to make Signum
 
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
University a school that New Hampshire
 
02:11:37.549 --> 02:11:37.559 align:start position:0%
can be proud to call her own I'd be
 
02:11:38.910 --> 02:11:38.920 align:start position:0%

for Mr Olen
 
02:11:53.709 --> 02:11:53.719 align:start position:0%

I know we haven't hav't met
 
02:12:12.990 --> 02:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
representative so we'll get it
 
02:12:16.549 --> 02:12:16.559 align:start position:0%
um I do I do have a couple questions uh
 
02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
Dr Olson sure both from last year to be
 
02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
honest with you uh one last year uh we
 
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
read and I think it's the same woman who
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
sent testimony this year uh supporting
 
02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
your program she's a currently a
 
02:12:32.910 --> 02:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
community college uh instructor over in
 
02:12:34.990 --> 02:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont and she sent assemble pie this
 
02:12:36.270 --> 02:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
year so
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
that I asked the same question last year
 
02:12:40.510 --> 02:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
I'll ask it again now but
 
02:12:43.149 --> 02:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
expanded um and listening you just speak
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
a moment ago you talk about your ma
 
02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
programs that expanded to multiple
 
02:12:50.430 --> 02:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
specifications versus just the one main
 
02:12:53.109 --> 02:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh Core Curriculum you had last year is
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
that right no that's not right um we
 
02:12:57.069 --> 02:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
have the same curriculum this year that
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
we had last year there's been no
 
02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
expansion of our ma curriculum oh okay I
 
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
thought the I thought the different
 
02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
majes I thought you only had one ma
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
program last year we do we still do uh I
 
02:13:07.069 --> 02:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
said that we have four different
 
02:13:09.069 --> 02:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
concentrations within our ma okay that
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
that was it okay thank you did you have
 
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
four last year as well four
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
concentrations yes we did okay I may
 
02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
just finish this then um the students
 
02:13:20.229 --> 02:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
from last last year through this uh end
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
of the Academic
 
02:13:25.629 --> 02:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
Year um how many finished the
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
program uh during this past year yes uh
 
02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
six or seven I believe finished during
 
02:13:34.270 --> 02:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
this last year okay and if I may follow
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
up Mr chairman so what did they
 
02:13:40.270 --> 02:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
get at the end of the year in June if
 
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
they finish the program and you weren't
 
02:13:43.870 --> 02:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
an accredited school what do they
 
02:13:46.830 --> 02:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
actually get for a degree they they get
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
an acknowledgement that they have
 
02:13:51.549 --> 02:13:51.559 align:start position:0%
completed our uh program and we shall
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
award them the official master's degree
 
02:13:56.069 --> 02:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
when we are awarded the authority to do
 
02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
so okay so so you just got another
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
question that was it that was it Mr just
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
to just to be clear by May Mr chairman
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
so that means that so at the end they
 
02:14:08.350 --> 02:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
just got a piece of paper signifying
 
02:14:09.709 --> 02:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
they finished your program they
 
02:14:11.669 --> 02:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
completed the program yep thank you very
 
02:14:14.350 --> 02:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
much thank you Mr Mr lad appreciate it
 
02:14:16.629 --> 02:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much represent Woodcock
 
02:14:22.910 --> 02:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:28.589 --> 02:14:28.599 align:start position:0%
Tanner oh you're muted Linda un
 
02:14:33.790 --> 02:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:36.669 --> 02:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
issue uh
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
oh I'm not good at the digital stuff can
 
02:14:43.549 --> 02:14:43.559 align:start position:0%
you me now barely hear you um I remember
 
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
asking you a question about whether
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
you'd be accepting title uh four funds
 
02:14:50.189 --> 02:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
and and also uh pel grants and I was
 
02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had changed on your um
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
position on that well of course we don't
 
02:14:58.109 --> 02:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
yet qualify for title 4 participation
 
02:14:59.350 --> 02:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
until after we complete the
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
accreditation process so that's not an
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
issue right now uh we have no plans to
 
02:15:06.030 --> 02:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
move forward with title 4 funding
 
02:15:08.589 --> 02:15:08.599 align:start position:0%
because we already have in place more
 
02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
than sufficient financial support for
 
02:15:13.229 --> 02:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
our students there is no student who has
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
ever wanted to attend Signum University
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
who has ever been barred by Financial
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
need and a large number of our students
 
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
have completed our degree and will
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
continue to complete our degree without
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
any charge whatsoever we already have
 
02:15:29.669 --> 02:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
programs in place for that um we may
 
02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
pursue that representative Tanner that's
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to have to I
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
mean that's as I said that's that's a
 
02:15:36.069 --> 02:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
stage down the road for us that's after
 
02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
the accreditation process and the
 
02:15:40.109 --> 02:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
possibility of participating in federal
 
02:15:42.030 --> 02:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
funding that would enable pel grants
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
though we have absolutely no interest in
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
participating in the student loan
 
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
programs uh which are inimical to to our
 
02:15:53.069 --> 02:15:53.079 align:start position:0%
founding Mission um uh the the the
 
02:15:55.510 --> 02:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
alleviation of the student debt problem
 
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
is one of the one of the
 
02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
founding concepts of Signum University
 
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not going to eliminate the
 
02:16:06.030 --> 02:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
possibility that we could do that but
 
02:16:08.189 --> 02:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
even with pelgrin we believe that there
 
02:16:11.470 --> 02:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
are better ways to make sure that our
 
02:16:13.629 --> 02:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
education is available we are also in
 
02:16:15.470 --> 02:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
the process right now by the way I would
 
02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
add representative Tanner of applying
 
02:16:21.870 --> 02:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
for scholarships um we have begun a a a
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
robust grant writing uh program we've
 
02:16:27.549 --> 02:16:27.559 align:start position:0%
already applied in the last month for
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
$120,000 worth of Grants uh which are
 
02:16:32.190 --> 02:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
designed to be dedicated to student
 
02:16:34.270 --> 02:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
scholarships for our various programs
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's a program that we're continuing
 
02:16:38.709 --> 02:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
um and these are mostly private grants
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
that we so far exclusively private
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
Foundation grants that we're applying
 
02:16:46.070 --> 02:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
for rather than using Federal funding uh
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
for this um so there are a number of uh
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
avenues that we are pursuing because one
 
02:16:54.270 --> 02:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
of our primary and foundational missions
 
02:16:56.750 --> 02:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that education can be
 
02:16:59.830 --> 02:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
available for all students regardless of
 
02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
financial income um and so participation
 
02:17:05.709 --> 02:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
in federal pel grants is something that
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
is one of the options that we may
 
02:17:09.750 --> 02:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
consider I am still not convinced it is
 
02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
among the best options uh for student
 
02:17:14.429 --> 02:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
aid but it is something that we will
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
consider but as I say for now it's quite
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to us because we have to
 
02:17:21.469 --> 02:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
first complete the accreditation process
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
before we could even begin
 
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
that may I have a followup go ahead um I
 
02:17:30.190 --> 02:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
out of just out of curiosity I don't
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
remember whether um you had said this
 
02:17:36.190 --> 02:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
last time but why are you only doing
 
02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
graduate ma um degrees rather than
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
starting out with undergraduate um can't
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
hear you we I can't hear that sure her
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
question was um and you can obviously
 
02:17:48.629 --> 02:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
correct me if I but I I know the audio
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
issue um her question was uh why are we
 
02:17:53.549 --> 02:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
starting with a graduate degree rather
 
02:17:55.389 --> 02:17:55.399 align:start position:0%
than beginning with an undergraduate
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
degree and the answer is that starting
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
up a new University from scratch with no
 
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
funding whatsoever is challenging um and
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
what we had when we began was a group of
 
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
people who were very interested to study
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
and to study at The Graduate level
 
02:18:15.790 --> 02:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
starting up a program a focused program
 
02:18:18.429 --> 02:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
within a single discipline really a pair
 
02:18:20.429 --> 02:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
of related disciplines the study of
 
02:18:23.950 --> 02:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
language and literature um uh was uh
 
02:18:27.389 --> 02:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
therefore enabled us to create a compact
 
02:18:30.270 --> 02:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
and efficient program that we could uh
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
we could basically afford to run and
 
02:18:34.509 --> 02:18:34.519 align:start position:0%
also of course that was my own field so
 
02:18:36.309 --> 02:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
I could teach in it and I had uh you
 
02:18:38.830 --> 02:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
know a number of other uh colleagues and
 
02:18:40.629 --> 02:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
Associates that I had made you know in
 
02:18:42.549 --> 02:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
my discipline around the world who were
 
02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
able to come in and teach in that
 
02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:48.599 align:start position:0%
program um so it was uh you you know
 
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
entirely what we were able to do at the
 
02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
beginning whereas if you attempt to
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
start uh with a you know with an
 
02:18:58.389 --> 02:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
undergraduate program you have to begin
 
02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
with a wide array of different majors
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
and programs which involves funding for
 
02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
a wide array of Faculty um and that was
 
02:19:07.790 --> 02:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
something that was well beyond our means
 
02:19:10.190 --> 02:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
Signum has never had any funding we've
 
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
never had any startup funding we've run
 
02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
our you know we our tuition is
 
02:19:16.150 --> 02:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
aggressively low compare our tuition to
 
02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
any institution out there at the
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
Master's Degree level um and we are
 
02:19:23.469 --> 02:19:23.479 align:start position:0%
aggressively below the tuition rates of
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
almost any other institution our courses
 
02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
cost $650 per course not per credit per
 
02:19:32.910 --> 02:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
course uh for our program it's less than
 
02:19:35.790 --> 02:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
$8,000 uh to do our entire master's
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
degree um and uh so so with that with
 
02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
that tuition income and W with mind with
 
02:19:48.030 --> 02:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
a bunch of it remitted uh for students
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
who declare themselves to be in
 
02:19:53.309 --> 02:19:53.319 align:start position:0%
financial need and without any startup
 
02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
funding or endowment of any kind um we
 
02:19:59.070 --> 02:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
began from scratch uh and so we began
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
with a focused narrow Niche program uh
 
02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
which served the market that I was
 
02:20:07.389 --> 02:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
already connected to through the podcast
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
that I was running so that's how we
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
began with a graduate program I know it
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
may seem a little bit unusual uh but
 
02:20:16.830 --> 02:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances that was how
 
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
things if involved and
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
developed thank thank you very much uh
 
02:20:24.429 --> 02:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
repent luno thank you thank you very
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and um and I'd also
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate your Indulgence Since U since
 
02:20:35.110 --> 02:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
um Mr Olsen um referenced U me during
 
02:20:36.389 --> 02:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
his earlier
 
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
testimony as well as a communication
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
that uh that he sent to me if that's
 
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay Mr
 
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
chair so uh what i' what I'd like to do
 
02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
is actually actually
 
02:20:53.550 --> 02:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
um uh read uh a few statements from uh
 
02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
from the email that uh that Dr Olsen
 
02:20:59.389 --> 02:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
sent to me on January 7th 2020 and you
 
02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
know I want to say right up front that
 
02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
it certainly didn't generate any um any
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
consternation um in fact it would be
 
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
funny if it wasn't so pathetic but um
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
but uh from this email Dr olssen goes on
 
02:21:16.750 --> 02:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
to say your statement both in your
 
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
motion in the committee session and in
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
your printed public opinion is puzzling
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
to say the least even if one disregards
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
its simple inaccuracies and
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
misrepresentations Mr luno I have had no
 
02:21:31.150 --> 02:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
desire to take this discussion to the
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
Press which I can't help but believe
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
could end up being very embarrassing for
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
both you and your party I am very happy
 
02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
to have all of these details come out
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
but I have not talked to any reporters
 
02:21:49.150 --> 02:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
about this because I saw no attempt a no
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
need to attempt to do so so long as
 
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
there was a chance that you would be
 
02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable and clear the
 
02:21:59.469 --> 02:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
record this needn't become any more of a
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
hassle than it has already been made to
 
02:22:04.590 --> 02:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
be if you agree to sit down and discuss
 
02:22:07.309 --> 02:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
this together then I will promise not to
 
02:22:09.710 --> 02:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
talk to any member of the press until
 
02:22:13.469 --> 02:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
after our conversation and in closing
 
02:22:15.389 --> 02:22:15.399 align:start position:0%
this does not have to be a public debate
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
Mr lunar let me know when you are
 
02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
willing to talk to clarify matters and
 
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
quietly so my first um question to Corey
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
Olsson is um are those are those words
 
02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:34.150 align:start position:0%
Olsson is um are those are those words
that

02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
email they are as I explained earlier of
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
course that as you read I propos to have
 
02:22:49.030 --> 02:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
a quiet meeting meeting I didn't want to
 
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
have a messy public debate um and uh you
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
know I wanted to resolve things in a
 
02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
civilized discussion instead there were
 
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies in the statement that you
 
02:23:02.030 --> 02:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
that you wrote Into the public record
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
which I felt it my responsibility to
 
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
rebut uh but as I said I did not wish to
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
do that in a public way I'd been
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
approached by several reporters for
 
02:23:15.790 --> 02:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
comments uh on this and so instead of
 
02:23:19.269 --> 02:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
merely responding in the Press um I
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
wrote to you first to offer a chance to
 
02:23:24.190 --> 02:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
talk about this quietly because I didn't
 
02:23:27.230 --> 02:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
want I did not have any interest uh in
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
engaging in a messy public debate so I
 
02:23:34.030 --> 02:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
offered to talk about it quietly and as
 
02:23:36.190 --> 02:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
I say I did not want to engage in a
 
02:23:39.710 --> 02:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
public debate and so when uh the bill
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
was tabled ultimately and therefore did
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
not receive the ratification of a house
 
02:23:47.309 --> 02:23:47.319 align:start position:0%
vote I Let It Drop because I did not
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
want to engage in a messy public
 
02:23:53.110 --> 02:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
debate Mr chair okay I I'd like to
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
interject for a second here um I'd like
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
to have all conversation directed
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
towards this Bill thank you with the
 
02:24:04.510 --> 02:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the changes right there
 
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
approved by the higher education
 
02:24:08.030 --> 02:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
commission and
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
authorized that that's what we're
 
02:24:11.550 --> 02:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
debating right now the rest of it's
 
02:24:12.670 --> 02:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
already in
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
statute uh or you know the first part of
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
that Roman 2
 
02:24:20.469 --> 02:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
then number number two down below is
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
what we can should also be debating but
 
02:24:25.630 --> 02:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we've had this situation
 
02:24:29.070 --> 02:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
occur in the past uh I'd like to see us
 
02:24:32.590 --> 02:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
moving forward here and not and if there
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
is this discussion it would be
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
appreciated by the entire committee here
 
02:24:39.790 --> 02:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
that we start discussing that on a on a
 
02:24:42.750 --> 02:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
private level between the two involved
 
02:24:45.469 --> 02:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
in this rather than taking up the time
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
we have right now to rehash this is not
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
going to get us any closer to a final
 
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
resolve of of this house
 
02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
bill well point of point point of
 
02:24:57.630 --> 02:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
information Mr
 
02:25:02.269 --> 02:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
chair what's happened here is that joh
 
02:25:02.279 --> 02:25:03.429 align:start position:0%
chair what's happened here is that joh
has

02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
threatened a representative and in my
 
02:25:09.429 --> 02:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
nine years in this in this uh work that
 
02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
we've been doing here I have never seen
 
02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:12.990 align:start position:0%
we've been doing here I have never seen
anybody

02:25:12.990 --> 02:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
02:25:17.230 --> 02:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
threatened with uh a public disposure
 
02:25:19.389 --> 02:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
like he did to representative luno and
 
02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:25:24.030 --> 02:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
indirectly because we disagreed with his
 
02:25:26.030 --> 02:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
approach to how he runs his university
 
02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
and what his university was doing so I
 
02:25:31.950 --> 02:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
think that that is relevant here as it
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
relates to the Integrity of of his
 
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
institution in
 
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
threatening a sitting representative Mr
 
02:25:44.750 --> 02:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
Miler the only thing I threatened as you
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
say is to publicly but a public
 
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
statement I made no personal threats of
 
02:25:56.230 --> 02:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
any kind I only said that I was going to
 
02:25:59.630 --> 02:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
rebut in public the statements publicly
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
made by Mr luno that's all that I said
 
02:26:05.309 --> 02:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
Mr myor that is that's not the way we
 
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
took it you do not deal you do not deal
 
02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:09.030 align:start position:0%
took it you do not deal you do not deal
with

02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:26:11.710 --> 02:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
representatives in a threatening fashion
 
02:26:15.309 --> 02:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
if you disagree with them I only said I
 
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
was going to disagree with them and in
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
public and I do not see how a public
 
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
disagreement with a public statement
 
02:26:26.750 --> 02:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
constitutes a threat as I've said if you
 
02:26:29.110 --> 02:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
thought my tone objectionable I can only
 
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
say that I feel sorry that you felt that
 
02:26:34.429 --> 02:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
way that was not at all my intention Mr
 
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
chair uh yes I'm going to interject
 
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
right now and um this conversation could
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
go on forever here and we're not going
 
02:26:44.309 --> 02:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
to resolve it at this moment here in in
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
the education committee um there might
 
02:26:50.190 --> 02:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
be another Avenue for this and I suspect
 
02:26:52.389 --> 02:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
if represent luno wants to choose that
 
02:26:55.269 --> 02:26:55.279 align:start position:0%

spouse that um I don't get paid for my
 
02:36:18.349 --> 02:36:18.359 align:start position:0%

02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh not offer an opinion as I really
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
don't have one on the matter um I'm
 
02:36:24.990 --> 02:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the facts as I said and here
 
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
to answer any factual questions
 
02:36:29.469 --> 02:36:29.479 align:start position:0%
regarding the process that Signum
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
University uh went through to gain their
 
02:36:34.150 --> 02:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
approval as well as the process they
 
02:36:38.750 --> 02:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
went through to then um be reapproved uh
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
through the end of the year so and a
 
02:36:43.469 --> 02:36:43.479 align:start position:0%
final followup on that Mr chair I'd like

02:36:48.750 --> 02:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
about a program here we're talking about
 
02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
authorization of Signum um I think it's
 
02:36:54.429 --> 02:36:54.439 align:start position:0%
unfair to ask another individual how
 
02:36:56.910 --> 02:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
dick gusterson May uh feel towards
 
02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
something um I'd like to try and keep uh
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
where you're going out of the
 
02:37:04.750 --> 02:37:04.760 align:start position:0%

various um um crimes and misdemeanors
 
02:37:27.870 --> 02:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
that would keep uh an educator out of
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
being hired by a school district seeing
 
02:37:33.910 --> 02:37:33.920 align:start position:0%

activity that was in the in the control
 
02:37:54.590 --> 02:37:54.600 align:start position:0%

02:37:57.710 --> 02:37:57.720 align:start position:0%

not going to do it through this
 
02:38:14.910 --> 02:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
committee and we're not going to use
 
02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:17.640 align:start position:0%

where you're going I'm done Mr chair

thank you I have a question represent
 
02:38:27.269 --> 02:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
Miler uh when we were considering uh
 
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
this uh school last year there were 13
 
02:38:33.510 --> 02:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
outstanding issues that they had not
 
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
complied with uh with the recommendation
 
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
from the commission are you aware
 
02:38:39.510 --> 02:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not those 13 have been
 
02:38:42.750 --> 02:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
complied with yes um thank you
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative Milo for the question um
 
02:38:46.230 --> 02:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
and I would say
 
02:38:48.990 --> 02:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
um there are always recommendations for
 
02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
every R review that the higher IDE
 
02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
commission conducts of any college
 
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
program in our state or from out of
 
02:38:59.590 --> 02:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
state and so having 13
 
02:39:02.110 --> 02:39:02.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations is not an unreasonable
 
02:39:05.550 --> 02:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
or unusual number and they have in fact
 
02:39:08.110 --> 02:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
um met all of those recommendations
 
02:39:10.990 --> 02:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
which was one of the bases for extending
 
02:39:12.389 --> 02:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
their approval through the end of this
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%

which is the beautiful Lakes Region and
 
03:30:25.150 --> 03:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
uh this is really a pretty simple piece
 
03:30:27.630 --> 03:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
of legislation that worked on with the
 
03:30:30.950 --> 03:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um due to uh
 
03:30:32.870 --> 03:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
occasional problems the department has
 
03:30:36.150 --> 03:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
had uh getting uh information from our
 
03:30:38.510 --> 03:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
local districts uh you can remember a
 
03:30:40.670 --> 03:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago we had a similar
 
03:30:44.229 --> 03:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
problem with um getting emergency plans
 
03:30:48.510 --> 03:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
from uh districts and it wasn't until um
 
03:30:50.990 --> 03:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
there was the threat of uh uh
 
03:30:53.349 --> 03:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
withholding of funds that the U
 
03:30:57.030 --> 03:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
emergency plans uh suddenly started to
 
03:31:01.389 --> 03:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
appear um this bill amends current
 
03:31:03.870 --> 03:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
statute related to the requirements for
 
03:31:06.389 --> 03:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
districts to report uh information to
 
03:31:06.399 --> 03:31:07.229 align:start position:0%
districts to report uh information to
the

03:31:07.229 --> 03:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:31:09.910 --> 03:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
department uh the current statute
 
03:31:12.309 --> 03:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
however does not includ include Charter
 
03:31:16.269 --> 03:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
Public Schools in a number of areas and
 
03:31:19.030 --> 03:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh that has uh occasionally presented
 
03:31:21.670 --> 03:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
problems uh going through the bill uh
 
03:31:24.790 --> 03:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
just to highlight those areas um in
 
03:31:28.150 --> 03:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
section one on on the first page uh
 
03:31:30.750 --> 03:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools are added along
 
03:31:33.070 --> 03:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
with the provision that failing to
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
comply with the financial reporting for
 
03:31:38.910 --> 03:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
two consecutive years uh would allow the
 
03:31:41.990 --> 03:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner to request that the State
 
03:31:44.790 --> 03:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
Board of Education revoke their
 
03:31:47.630 --> 03:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
Charter I think that this might um
 
03:31:49.790 --> 03:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
encourage them to get those reports in
 
03:31:49.800 --> 03:31:50.590 align:start position:0%
encourage them to get those reports in
on

03:31:50.590 --> 03:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:31:56.590 --> 03:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
time um in section two just down um uh
 
03:31:59.469 --> 03:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
about the middle of the page line 15 uh
 
03:32:01.150 --> 03:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
with statistical
 
03:32:03.790 --> 03:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
reports uh these reports are used to
 
03:32:06.590 --> 03:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
calculate a deily average membership uh
 
03:32:08.469 --> 03:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
Staffing information
 
03:32:11.389 --> 03:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
Etc um this
 
03:32:15.389 --> 03:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
new language adds uh a new report and
 
03:32:18.309 --> 03:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
that is prior year safety uh
 
03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
information and uh also provides for
 
03:32:22.750 --> 03:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
other reports that the department might
 
03:32:25.429 --> 03:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
feel are necessary to comply with uh
 
03:32:28.389 --> 03:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
federal and state law and here again we
 
03:32:30.950 --> 03:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
also add chartered Public Schools as
 
03:32:34.710 --> 03:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
well as non-public schools in this
 
03:32:38.510 --> 03:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
requirement uh starting on line 25 uh
 
03:32:41.349 --> 03:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
Section 1 a uh additional reporting
 
03:32:43.269 --> 03:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
requirements are added for non-public
 
03:32:46.870 --> 03:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
schools along here with the penalty also
 
03:32:51.830 --> 03:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
of U uh having their Charter or uh
 
03:32:54.670 --> 03:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
approval revoked by the department um
 
03:32:57.030 --> 03:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
and the state court if
 
03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
necessary on section three over on page
 
03:33:03.630 --> 03:33:03.640 align:start position:0%
two uh we modify the extension provision
 
03:33:08.269 --> 03:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
for subu reports to specify that a delay
 
03:33:11.429 --> 03:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
that does not impact State calculations
 
03:33:15.150 --> 03:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
uh in uh using those statistic reports
 
03:33:20.070 --> 03:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
um allows for further extensions um for
 
03:33:24.269 --> 03:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
getting the reports in in section four
 
03:33:28.189 --> 03:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
uh beginning on line 11 I believe it is
 
03:33:31.269 --> 03:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
03:33:35.630 --> 03:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh chapter on Charter Schools is updated
 
03:33:39.309 --> 03:33:39.319 align:start position:0%
to reflect that failure to report as we
 
03:33:41.110 --> 03:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
have discussed as well just for
 
03:33:43.389 --> 03:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
consistency uh purposes that need to be
 
03:33:45.870 --> 03:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
inserted in the charter school chapter
 
03:33:49.590 --> 03:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
as well and then finally on uh section
 
03:33:50.950 --> 03:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
five on line
 
03:33:55.110 --> 03:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
17 uh we get into the uh monetary
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
reporting and throughout 198 4D school
 
03:34:05.670 --> 03:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
districts are in statute and HP 442 adds
 
03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools here
 
03:34:09.680 --> 03:34:11.670 align:start position:0%
chartered public schools here
again

03:34:11.670 --> 03:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:34:15.030 --> 03:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
occasionally the failure to
 
03:34:18.550 --> 03:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
report has caused problems and it's a
 
03:34:22.150 --> 03:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
very small number of instances um that I
 
03:34:24.150 --> 03:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
believe the department has a spokesman
 
03:34:26.510 --> 03:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
here who will uh probably uh be able to
 
03:34:30.830 --> 03:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
refer to uh but this will help the
 
03:34:34.349 --> 03:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
department in fulfilling their statutory
 
03:34:38.990 --> 03:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
requirements um and I uh will have my
 
03:34:41.670 --> 03:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
testimony there and be glad to take any
 
03:34:45.630 --> 03:34:45.640 align:start position:0%
questions and U also uh refer some
 
03:34:48.189 --> 03:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
questions to the department thank you
 
03:34:50.110 --> 03:34:50.120 align:start position:0%

just printed out from my my computer but
 
03:35:15.389 --> 03:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
I was wondering in section 1A uh where
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
you've done a crossover of average daily
 
03:35:20.150 --> 03:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
membership in attendance fall enrollment
 
03:35:23.150 --> 03:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
and teacher staff census why exactly was
 
03:35:25.389 --> 03:35:25.399 align:start position:0%
that crossed out for charter schools and
 
03:35:28.150 --> 03:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
for uh non-public
 
03:35:28.160 --> 03:35:30.030 align:start position:0%
for uh non-public
schools

03:35:30.030 --> 03:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:35:32.910 --> 03:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
um you can ask the department more about
 
03:35:34.910 --> 03:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
that but I'm not sure if the nonpublic
 
03:35:38.189 --> 03:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
schools are required to submit average
 
03:35:38.199 --> 03:35:39.590 align:start position:0%
schools are required to submit average
daily

03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
daily
 
03:35:39.600 --> 03:35:41.110 align:start position:0%
daily
membership

03:35:41.110 --> 03:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
membership
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
are are they uh followup please yes are
 
03:35:47.189 --> 03:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
they required for the rest of the things
 
03:35:50.590 --> 03:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
the uh School emergency plan the yes uh
 
03:35:52.870 --> 03:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
state they're they're required for those
 
03:35:54.870 --> 03:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
other things I'm sorry that's what is
 
03:35:56.910 --> 03:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
added in this section yes the the
 
03:35:58.349 --> 03:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
department wants that information from
 
03:36:02.269 --> 03:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
the non-public schools um has that been
 
03:36:04.750 --> 03:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
required of them
 
03:36:08.389 --> 03:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
before um I don't believe in statute it
 
03:36:11.870 --> 03:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
has been required of them
 
03:36:11.880 --> 03:36:12.910 align:start position:0%
has been required of them
thank

03:36:12.910 --> 03:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you very much uh
 
03:36:18.229 --> 03:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you Mr
 
03:36:20.150 --> 03:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
chairman represent cell just a quick
 
03:36:23.630 --> 03:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
question on line 17 in the uh
 
03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
statistical reporting just curious why
 
03:36:30.150 --> 03:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
they exed out August one where that date
 
03:36:31.550 --> 03:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
may have given schools an opportunity to
 
03:36:34.670 --> 03:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:40.550 --> 03:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
dates um I think probably the U uh uh
 
03:36:41.990 --> 03:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
young lady from the Department of
 
03:36:44.070 --> 03:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
Education might have a better answer to
 
03:36:46.550 --> 03:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
that than I
 
03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:48.510 align:start position:0%
that than I
do

03:36:48.510 --> 03:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you very much uh
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock the young lady
 
03:36:55.670 --> 03:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
they're talking about is Caitlyn Davis
 
03:36:57.429 --> 03:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
and I I think you're probably familiar
 
03:36:57.439 --> 03:36:58.389 align:start position:0%
and I I think you're probably familiar
with

03:36:58.389 --> 03:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:37:01.990 --> 03:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn I'm sure the answer I do have
 
03:37:04.830 --> 03:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
the answer um well thank you very much
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Caitlyn Davis I a
 
03:37:08.830 --> 03:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
director at the Department of Education
 
03:37:11.950 --> 03:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
um and we actually had reached out um
 
03:37:13.389 --> 03:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education to
 
03:37:15.670 --> 03:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli to ask him to
 
03:37:17.550 --> 03:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor this bill for the department
 
03:37:20.269 --> 03:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
or to sponsor we are a sponsor um for
 
03:37:21.990 --> 03:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
the Department because of some
 
03:37:24.110 --> 03:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
challenges that we've experienced with a
 
03:37:26.670 --> 03:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
very select few schools over the last
 
03:37:29.229 --> 03:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
few years um and we had actually asked
 
03:37:30.870 --> 03:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
for this bill to be sponsored last year
 
03:37:33.150 --> 03:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
too and unfortunately um with everything
 
03:37:34.469 --> 03:37:34.479 align:start position:0%
that had happened it got a little
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
derailed um through that process um
 
03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
there are the reason we asked for this
 
03:37:42.189 --> 03:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
legislation is there are a few schools
 
03:37:47.070 --> 03:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
and by a few I mean about a handful that
 
03:37:50.349 --> 03:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
continually do not report information on
 
03:37:53.630 --> 03:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
time and then as a result of that we are
 
03:37:55.830 --> 03:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
held up at the state to from reporting
 
03:37:57.990 --> 03:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
various federal and state reports that
 
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
we need to submit like average daily
 
03:38:02.870 --> 03:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
membership cost per pupil teacher
 
03:38:05.429 --> 03:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
average salaries and whatnot so this
 
03:38:08.030 --> 03:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
language already exists on the the books
 
03:38:11.110 --> 03:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
for district Public Schools um we very
 
03:38:13.150 --> 03:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
very rarely will actually trigger that
 
03:38:15.950 --> 03:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
language we only had one school for
 
03:38:19.870 --> 03:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
example this past year that failed to um
 
03:38:23.910 --> 03:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
failed to report their doe2 on time or
 
03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
to file an request for an extension
 
03:38:27.670 --> 03:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
because the department of education
 
03:38:30.269 --> 03:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
allows them to file an ex request
 
03:38:33.429 --> 03:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
request for extension through November
 
03:38:37.870 --> 03:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
6th and so what we did was we um then
 
03:38:39.189 --> 03:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
notified them that we would be holding
 
03:38:41.150 --> 03:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
any additional state Aid paid after
 
03:38:44.110 --> 03:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
November 6th keep in mind the deadline
 
03:38:46.710 --> 03:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
was September 1st and had that school
 
03:38:48.750 --> 03:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
just filed an extension we would have
 
03:38:51.150 --> 03:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
paid that school so that was really the
 
03:38:54.269 --> 03:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
the issue with that we do have a select
 
03:38:56.110 --> 03:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
few Charter Schools just like the
 
03:38:58.389 --> 03:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
traditional public schools that have you
 
03:39:00.269 --> 03:39:00.279 align:start position:0%
know we have the same challenge with and
 
03:39:03.229 --> 03:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have that kind of
 
03:39:04.990 --> 03:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
ability to hold the funding so we do
 
03:39:06.910 --> 03:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
have to continue to pay them even though
 
03:39:08.830 --> 03:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
they haven't reported extremely
 
03:39:10.670 --> 03:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
important financial information to the
 
03:39:13.630 --> 03:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
department including the doe2 and
 
03:39:16.269 --> 03:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
potentially audited financial statements
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
which would allow the Department of
 
03:39:19.389 --> 03:39:19.399 align:start position:0%
Education to really ensure that the
 
03:39:21.150 --> 03:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
schools are appropriately using that
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
funding in the correct manner so that's
 
03:39:25.670 --> 03:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
really why we as asked for that
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
legislation to be filed um a clar
 
03:39:31.870 --> 03:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
clarification for the August 1 um so the
 
03:39:34.830 --> 03:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
August 1 we that August 1 deadline is a
 
03:39:36.590 --> 03:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
little bit confusing because some of
 
03:39:38.550 --> 03:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
those things that need to be reported
 
03:39:40.550 --> 03:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
actually need to be reported sooner than
 
03:39:43.110 --> 03:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
that um because they go into larger
 
03:39:46.429 --> 03:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
calculations and some of those um
 
03:39:49.229 --> 03:39:49.239 align:start position:0%
deadlines they have specific parts so
 
03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
the August 1 deadline while it's called
 
03:39:53.910 --> 03:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
out in law people are saying or people
 
03:39:56.670 --> 03:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
often say is that August 1 required the
 
03:39:58.189 --> 03:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
first submission to the Department of
 
03:40:00.349 --> 03:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
Education or the final submission
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
because schools submit data review data
 
03:40:06.990 --> 03:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
um you know cleared anomalies and look
 
03:40:10.189 --> 03:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
you know um do D data validation so the
 
03:40:12.389 --> 03:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
August first is just kind of a confusing
 
03:40:14.750 --> 03:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
point the Department of Education every
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
single year provides numerous trainings
 
03:40:18.950 --> 03:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
for schools about deadlines we published
 
03:40:21.510 --> 03:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
deadlines on law I mean sorry on our uh
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
deadlines um on our website and make
 
03:40:25.910 --> 03:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
sure to communicate that with schools of
 
03:40:27.630 --> 03:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
what what the expectations are so we
 
03:40:29.189 --> 03:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
don't think the August 1 would actually
 
03:40:31.830 --> 03:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
be an issue at all um it's just you know
 
03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
if something needs to be changed the
 
03:40:35.950 --> 03:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
August first deadline actually is to
 
03:40:39.150 --> 03:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
it's a um it doesn't really add
 
03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient time for the Department of
 
03:40:43.070 --> 03:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
Education to be able to do some of the
 
03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
um reporting that we need to do at the
 
03:40:47.870 --> 03:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year so um the we have
 
03:40:50.750 --> 03:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
kind of artificially moved that up um
 
03:40:53.349 --> 03:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
right now um and and we do need it to be
 
03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit earlier the last point is
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
with the non-public schools um so yes
 
03:41:00.110 --> 03:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
the non-public schools are not required
 
03:41:04.469 --> 03:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
to submit um teacher salaries um or some
 
03:41:06.510 --> 03:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
of the other information that is listed
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
right there I actually don't have the
 
03:41:09.790 --> 03:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
bill pulled up in front of me because I
 
03:41:12.590 --> 03:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
don't zoom and that on both my screens
 
03:41:15.229 --> 03:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
um but the intent of the bill was not to
 
03:41:17.790 --> 03:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
require anybody to to submit any new
 
03:41:20.269 --> 03:41:20.279 align:start position:0%
information or change anything in the in
 
03:41:22.110 --> 03:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
the way they're submitting the data all
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
of the data that is called out in this
 
03:41:27.710 --> 03:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
law is already in a law someplace else
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
um and that includes the safety report
 
03:41:31.990 --> 03:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
so non-public schools are required to
 
03:41:34.389 --> 03:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
submit it um but we have had some
 
03:41:36.110 --> 03:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
challenges with some non-public schools
 
03:41:38.510 --> 03:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
in the past and that's why we um added
 
03:41:40.030 --> 03:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
that language and here want to clar
 
03:41:41.870 --> 03:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
verify that they are actually required
 
03:41:44.149 --> 03:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
to submit it because it's a little bit
 
03:41:46.110 --> 03:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
confusing when it looks when you look at
 
03:41:47.630 --> 03:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
the law and it says right here what
 
03:41:50.550 --> 03:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
they're required to submit and versus
 
03:41:52.030 --> 03:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
another area of the law that talks about
 
03:41:53.590 --> 03:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
the report and says non-public schools
 
03:41:55.830 --> 03:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
are required to submit it so that's kind
 
03:41:57.429 --> 03:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
of we were trying to clarify that with
 
03:41:59.870 --> 03:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
that any other questions for
 
03:42:02.950 --> 03:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
me uh yes uh Caitlyn I have one question
 
03:42:04.590 --> 03:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
for you this Rick
 
03:42:08.269 --> 03:42:08.279 align:start position:0%
lad I'll take M so you can hear me uh
 
03:42:10.870 --> 03:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
are some school districts requiring
 
03:42:13.990 --> 03:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
prior to the submitt of their doe 25
 
03:42:17.110 --> 03:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
form to have that form
 
03:42:20.349 --> 03:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
audited and if they do so is there
 
03:42:22.870 --> 03:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
enough time from the end of the fiscal
 
03:42:25.990 --> 03:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
year to you know the deadline that you
 
03:42:28.110 --> 03:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
set for them to get those audited before
 
03:42:29.229 --> 03:42:29.239 align:start position:0%
they come to
 
03:42:34.030 --> 03:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
you so the doe 25 deadline is a chicken
 
03:42:36.910 --> 03:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
in the egg sort of situation yes some
 
03:42:40.110 --> 03:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
school districts have the doe 25 um
 
03:42:42.590 --> 03:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
prepared by their Auditors actually the
 
03:42:45.309 --> 03:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
number seems to increase each year um
 
03:42:47.070 --> 03:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
but it is not a state requirement for it
 
03:42:50.590 --> 03:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
to be audited how and and the September
 
03:42:52.469 --> 03:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
1 deadline would be a challenge if they
 
03:42:54.429 --> 03:42:54.439 align:start position:0%
were going to have their auditor prepare
 
03:42:56.750 --> 03:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
it because um it's a pretty tight
 
03:42:58.590 --> 03:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
deadline with wrapping up the end of the
 
03:43:00.429 --> 03:43:00.439 align:start position:0%
school year which ends on June 30th and
 
03:43:02.790 --> 03:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
and having financial statements prepared
 
03:43:07.030 --> 03:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
however the do25 is a required document
 
03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
um by the Department of Education and
 
03:43:12.429 --> 03:43:12.439 align:start position:0%
the ra for tax rate setting so the
 
03:43:14.429 --> 03:43:14.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has to review
 
03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
the doe2 give the the appropriate
 
03:43:19.070 --> 03:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
information to the Department of Revenue
 
03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
and then they use that information for
 
03:43:22.510 --> 03:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
tax rate setting so if you were to push
 
03:43:24.710 --> 03:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
it back any further the Department of
 
03:43:26.349 --> 03:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue wouldn't be able to set the tax
 
03:43:28.429 --> 03:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
rates in an appropriate time period
 
03:43:29.790 --> 03:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
which they usually try to get most of
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
them out in the middle of October and
 
03:43:32.399 --> 03:43:33.550 align:start position:0%
them out in the middle of October and
early

03:43:33.550 --> 03:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
early
 
03:43:36.469 --> 03:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
November thank you Caitlyn I I see that
 
03:43:39.429 --> 03:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
representative Le has his hand up thank
 
03:43:42.149 --> 03:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and um thank you uh Miss
 
03:43:44.590 --> 03:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
Davis uh for for taking a question here
 
03:43:46.830 --> 03:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
and I apologize I'm new to the committee
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
so I don't know all the ins and outs of
 
03:43:49.990 --> 03:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
things here but I want to follow up on
 
03:43:51.790 --> 03:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
just what uh representative Tanner asked
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
before so I'm looking at line 25 section
 
03:43:57.189 --> 03:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
1A where it go non-public schools shall
 
03:43:59.309 --> 03:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
submit and it eliminates average daily
 
03:44:00.990 --> 03:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
membership in attendance fall enrollment
 
03:44:03.229 --> 03:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
and teacher staff census that was all in
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
that is all in current statute um so if
 
03:44:10.110 --> 03:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
that is eliminated um do those reports
 
03:44:12.750 --> 03:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
still have to be made by non-public then
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
so um I think that the part that's a
 
03:44:17.469 --> 03:44:17.479 align:start position:0%
little bit confusing is the paragraph
 
03:44:19.630 --> 03:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
above it now adds non-public schools
 
03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
into it and it lists that
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
information whereas this one right here
 
03:44:27.349 --> 03:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
actually um talks about the other
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
specific reports that only non-public
 
03:44:30.870 --> 03:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
schools are required to submit thank you
 
03:44:34.110 --> 03:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
I see it thank you thank you uh
 
03:44:36.189 --> 03:44:36.199 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner you have your hand
 
03:44:39.870 --> 03:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
up um I should take it down I I had this
 
03:44:42.349 --> 03:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
same question as representative Lei that
 
03:44:44.550 --> 03:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
it looked like that the private schools
 
03:44:46.990 --> 03:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
were already submitting reports on a
 
03:44:50.189 --> 03:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
average daily membership Etc and that it
 
03:44:53.110 --> 03:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
had changed to General statistics of
 
03:44:54.750 --> 03:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
non-public schools and I'm just
 
03:44:58.030 --> 03:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's where the change was
 
03:45:02.429 --> 03:45:02.439 align:start position:0%
to um take out specific uh
 
03:45:05.429 --> 03:45:05.439 align:start position:0%
requirements so I guess I'll ask that of
 
03:45:05.439 --> 03:45:07.590 align:start position:0%
requirements so I guess I'll ask that of
Caitlyn

03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn
 
03:45:11.309 --> 03:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
again um so Jack General statistics so
 
03:45:13.590 --> 03:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's actually a report that we use um
 
03:45:15.510 --> 03:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's like the name of a report that we
 
03:45:18.870 --> 03:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
have in our system and so the state
 
03:45:21.469 --> 03:45:21.479 align:start position:0%
state seclusion report the general fall
 
03:45:23.469 --> 03:45:23.479 align:start position:0%
collection those are all the names of
 
03:45:25.469 --> 03:45:25.479 align:start position:0%
actual reports whereas before when we
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
were talking about average daily
 
03:45:28.110 --> 03:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
membership and follow those were just
 
03:45:31.349 --> 03:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
kind of more specific type things uh
 
03:45:35.070 --> 03:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up please yes you may um so what
 
03:45:37.309 --> 03:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
exactly is in the general statistics of
 
03:45:39.870 --> 03:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
non-public school report I don't don't
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
have a copy of it right here in front of
 
03:45:43.149 --> 03:45:43.159 align:start position:0%
me they can certainly send the committee
 
03:45:45.590 --> 03:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
a copy of
 
03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much uh represent
 
03:45:50.950 --> 03:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
Miler uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:45:52.910 --> 03:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
you Caitlyn for being with us today
 
03:45:55.510 --> 03:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
could you remind us again what is in the
 
03:45:55.520 --> 03:46:00.189 align:start position:0%
could you remind us again what is in the
safety

03:46:00.189 --> 03:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
report um so Diana Fenton is on the
 
03:46:06.590 --> 03:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
phone I believe and she may be better
 
03:46:08.429 --> 03:46:08.439 align:start position:0%
equipped to answer that report as she
 
03:46:11.189 --> 03:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
reviews it I don't know if we could I
 
03:46:13.630 --> 03:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
could phone a friend for that one Zuma
 
03:46:15.870 --> 03:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
friend that's that's that's okay if you
 
03:46:17.550 --> 03:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
don't if you don't know that's that's
 
03:46:19.910 --> 03:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
fine I so I just don't have it memorized
 
03:46:21.830 --> 03:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
I can certainly send the committee of
 
03:46:24.030 --> 03:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
the committee a copy of that report
 
03:46:30.750 --> 03:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
you representative luno I don't know
 
03:46:35.830 --> 03:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we're we're hold on a second we're
 
03:46:38.510 --> 03:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
trying to see if uh Diana Fenton is
 
03:46:41.070 --> 03:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
available or whether she wants to
 
03:46:44.389 --> 03:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
answer promoted she has been
 
03:46:49.309 --> 03:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:51.670 --> 03:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant okay uh in the inter room
 
03:46:53.550 --> 03:46:53.560 align:start position:0%

03:46:57.149 --> 03:46:57.159 align:start position:0%

03:47:01.349 --> 03:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
Davis and and Miss Fenton for being with
 
03:47:03.870 --> 03:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
us this afternoon this could be a tossup
 
03:47:07.710 --> 03:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
question to to either one of um uh you
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
but but there there is some change
 
03:47:12.030 --> 03:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
and this relates to what representative
 
03:47:13.550 --> 03:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
Tanner and representative Lei were
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
asking about too but but change in the
 
03:47:20.670 --> 03:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
use of the words District school and
 
03:47:24.309 --> 03:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
Education Agency and I was wondering um
 
03:47:26.750 --> 03:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
if that's a material change or if those
 
03:47:29.790 --> 03:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
three um terms I mean are they different
 
03:47:31.149 --> 03:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
can they be used
 
03:47:33.990 --> 03:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
interchangeably um and in in particular
 
03:47:37.630 --> 03:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
you you'll see how that changes in um
 
03:47:40.389 --> 03:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
section two Roman one
 
03:47:43.950 --> 03:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
um where we where we go from public
 
03:47:47.830 --> 03:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
education agency now to calling it um a
 
03:47:50.950 --> 03:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
non-public Education Agency and a public
 
03:47:58.870 --> 03:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:01.110 --> 03:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
two you've got private schools but
 
03:48:02.830 --> 03:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
there's there's a area where it goes
 
03:48:06.429 --> 03:48:06.439 align:start position:0%
from from District to schools and I was
 
03:48:08.630 --> 03:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
just wondering if that how material that
 
03:48:08.640 --> 03:48:11.870 align:start position:0%
just wondering if that how material that
is

03:48:11.870 --> 03:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:16.269 --> 03:48:16.279 align:start position:0%
okay uh anybody have an answer to that
 
03:48:19.110 --> 03:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
or Di has her hand up let's see where we
 
03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
go there uh welcome uh attorney
 
03:48:26.189 --> 03:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
Fenton oh good afternoon and I always
 
03:48:27.790 --> 03:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
cringe when people call me attorney
 
03:48:29.920 --> 03:48:29.930 align:start position:0%
Fenton it just means I'm in
 
03:48:29.930 --> 03:48:32.550 align:start position:0%
Fenton it just means I'm in
[Laughter]

03:48:32.550 --> 03:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:48:35.590 --> 03:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
trouble go for
 
03:48:38.269 --> 03:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
it if you could bring me up to speed I
 
03:48:40.710 --> 03:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
was multitasking at at the time I got
 
03:48:40.720 --> 03:48:43.030 align:start position:0%
was multitasking at at the time I got
promoted

03:48:43.030 --> 03:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
promoted
 
03:48:46.110 --> 03:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
um is it to is it to answer
 
03:48:47.630 --> 03:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative Luna's question of
 
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:52.830 --> 03:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
material one of the one of the questions
 
03:48:57.030 --> 03:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
which we had here uh is uh the school
 
03:48:59.229 --> 03:48:59.239 align:start position:0%
emergency operation plan it was dealing
 
03:49:01.070 --> 03:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
with safety what are some of the
 
03:49:05.389 --> 03:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:08.910 --> 03:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
know the school emergency plan that
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
would not fall within my world I'm I'm
 
03:49:13.670 --> 03:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
not sadly I'm not familiar with what
 
03:49:16.229 --> 03:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
that would be and I don't know yeah I
 
03:49:18.269 --> 03:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I think I thought the question
 
03:49:20.950 --> 03:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
was about the school safety report which
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
if you want I've have now since pulled
 
03:49:24.510 --> 03:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
it up on my screen and I can share it I
 
03:49:29.670 --> 03:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.990 --> 03:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
or I think if you just review some of
 
03:49:35.189 --> 03:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
the contents is what I was concerned
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
about just the flavor of the survey
 
03:49:38.319 --> 03:49:41.790 align:start position:0%
about just the flavor of the survey
right

03:49:41.790 --> 03:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:44.429 --> 03:49:44.439 align:start position:0%
so the school safety survey um it has a
 
03:49:46.510 --> 03:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
variety of Statistics in it um the
 
03:49:48.870 --> 03:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
number of seclusion reports rest stain
 
03:49:52.510 --> 03:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
reports um from by and it's by school
 
03:49:55.990 --> 03:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's a very comprehensive report um and
 
03:49:58.309 --> 03:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
it's submitted by every school public
 
03:50:01.630 --> 03:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
non-public and District school in the
 
03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
state uh in charter
 
03:50:08.469 --> 03:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
school um so I'm opening it right now
 
03:50:11.309 --> 03:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
and I can kind of through it um so the
 
03:50:13.870 --> 03:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
the report every single year um Diana
 
03:50:15.309 --> 03:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
it's presented to the State Board of
 
03:50:17.510 --> 03:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
Education that's correct right you
 
03:50:19.590 --> 03:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
usually do that report with
 
03:50:23.469 --> 03:50:23.479 align:start position:0%
Rich yes yeah um and so so it has so I
 
03:50:25.149 --> 03:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
said restraint some invest any
 
03:50:26.910 --> 03:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
information on restraints and seclusion
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
that's being investigated um and it it
 
03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
kind of goes into the detail of you know
 
03:50:35.349 --> 03:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
did the the restraints um result in
 
03:50:38.710 --> 03:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
bodily harm Serious injury um and then
 
03:50:40.830 --> 03:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
it good kind of same types of questions
 
03:50:42.229 --> 03:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
about seclusion the number
 
03:50:44.550 --> 03:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
investigations with seclusion then
 
03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
there's questions about
 
03:50:49.950 --> 03:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
harassment and the types of harassment
 
03:50:52.870 --> 03:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
um that are being reported by the school
 
03:50:54.750 --> 03:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
um you know if they were related to
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
gender sexual orientation race and color
 
03:51:02.510 --> 03:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
or national origin disability physical
 
03:51:05.790 --> 03:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
characteristics um and so then it it
 
03:51:08.070 --> 03:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
goes through all of that um and then we
 
03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
have a we have a bullying
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
section and it talks about you know the
 
03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
types of bullying that is occurring so
 
03:51:16.990 --> 03:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
was it cyber bullying bullying of any
 
03:51:20.349 --> 03:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
kind um is the are the bullying based on
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
gender sexual orientation race color
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
national origin
 
03:51:28.910 --> 03:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
disability um and then were the bullying
 
03:51:32.830 --> 03:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
incidentes singly uh single or were they
 
03:51:36.389 --> 03:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
significant was there a pattern um was
 
03:51:38.469 --> 03:51:38.479 align:start position:0%
there did it include physical abuse or
 
03:51:41.710 --> 03:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
harm Dam damage to property um use of
 
03:51:46.830 --> 03:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
emotional or social alienizer in school
 
03:51:49.269 --> 03:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
operations and then there's a variety of
 
03:51:52.149 --> 03:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
other um types of things that we collect
 
03:51:53.830 --> 03:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
including student
 
03:51:57.790 --> 03:51:57.800 align:start position:0%
discipline um the the the types of
 
03:52:00.110 --> 03:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
discipline including suspensions and
 
03:52:03.790 --> 03:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
expulsions okay um keep going I don't
 
03:52:05.590 --> 03:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
know that that's good enough thank you
 
03:52:07.469 --> 03:52:07.479 align:start position:0%
very much yeah it it sounds very
 
03:52:11.830 --> 03:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
thorough yes extremely thorough um and
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
it is on the doe website if anybody is
 
03:52:16.510 --> 03:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
you know interested in taking a look at
 
03:52:19.510 --> 03:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
that there's information for the last
 
03:52:21.030 --> 03:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
three years for every school in the
 
03:52:22.229 --> 03:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
03:52:24.269 --> 03:52:24.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are there any further
 
03:52:27.070 --> 03:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
questions for Caitlyn Davis or for Diana
 
03:52:31.950 --> 03:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
Fenton uh dougl I see your hand up well
 
03:52:34.830 --> 03:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
mine's still out there oh okay I was
 
03:52:36.349 --> 03:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
going to follow
 
03:52:39.510 --> 03:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
up go ahead B sorry go ahead represent
 
03:52:42.030 --> 03:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
luno no no the the the question was
 
03:52:46.149 --> 03:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
asked basically the um the the the
 
03:52:50.030 --> 03:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
changes back in um section two Roman one
 
03:52:53.030 --> 03:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
and section three Roman 4 of the use of
 
03:52:55.389 --> 03:52:55.399 align:start position:0%
the terms District school and Education
 
03:52:58.469 --> 03:52:58.479 align:start position:0%
Agency just wondering if those are you
 
03:53:00.630 --> 03:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
know when it talks about like in section
 
03:53:03.710 --> 03:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
three Roman four that the department can
 
03:53:07.830 --> 03:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
grant a waiver um or a 30-day extension
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
to a school district
 
03:53:13.349 --> 03:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
and now it's being changed from that's
 
03:53:16.030 --> 03:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
struck um School District City or public
 
03:53:18.630 --> 03:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
Academy and being replaced by public
 
03:53:20.229 --> 03:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
school chartered public school or
 
03:53:23.429 --> 03:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
non-public school is is is there a
 
03:53:26.269 --> 03:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
material difference in in that and then
 
03:53:30.149 --> 03:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
the term Education Agency I think is is
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
um is used up in um in um oh section two
 
03:53:38.429 --> 03:53:38.439 align:start position:0%
Roman one and uh just wondering if
 
03:53:42.389 --> 03:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
that's um you know does that make a
 
03:53:44.189 --> 03:53:44.199 align:start position:0%
difference and what's the difference
 
03:53:47.110 --> 03:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.229 --> 03:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
terms Diana do you want to take this
 
03:53:54.590 --> 03:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
one well I think it was I think Caitlyn
 
03:53:56.229 --> 03:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
I could probably answer it together I
 
03:53:58.670 --> 03:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
think it was to address that we wanted
 
03:54:02.790 --> 03:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
it to apply clearly to these
 
03:54:06.030 --> 03:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
entities um which my understanding is
 
03:54:08.950 --> 03:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
currently it does it does not so I think
 
03:54:10.710 --> 03:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
school district has been
 
03:54:14.269 --> 03:54:14.279 align:start position:0%
expanded um and then the city Republic
 
03:54:16.510 --> 03:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
Academy I think those are kind of older
 
03:54:18.670 --> 03:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
terms is my understanding of the statute
 
03:54:23.070 --> 03:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
more yeah so we the public Academy
 
03:54:28.110 --> 03:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
really refers to there's three schools
 
03:54:30.189 --> 03:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
in the state that are considered
 
03:54:32.469 --> 03:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
Publicis um but they're not run by a
 
03:54:37.429 --> 03:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
specific School Board um for as far as
 
03:54:39.910 --> 03:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
interchangeably at the top with the use
 
03:54:42.550 --> 03:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
of Education Agency I think that's I
 
03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
think that's really just where the um
 
03:54:47.469 --> 03:54:47.479 align:start position:0%
term was chosen to be inserted for to
 
03:54:50.030 --> 03:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
add non-public and Charter Schools um
 
03:54:53.110 --> 03:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
when we the the last part where it talks
 
03:54:55.790 --> 03:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
about the Department's authority to hold
 
03:54:58.630 --> 03:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
payments that part um we had an
 
03:55:00.550 --> 03:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law at the time
 
03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
and they said the that it was not broad
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
enough and because it specifically said
 
03:55:11.070 --> 03:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
public school um sorry Public District
 
03:55:13.189 --> 03:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
or or public Academy that the
 
03:55:15.750 --> 03:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
Department's authority to hold payment
 
03:55:19.110 --> 03:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
did not also extend to a public charter
 
03:55:21.750 --> 03:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
school in this specific instance so
 
03:55:23.550 --> 03:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
that's why we added the word charter
 
03:55:25.950 --> 03:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
school or non-public school into
 
03:55:29.670 --> 03:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
there so quick followup on that Mr chair
 
03:55:35.670 --> 03:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
yes um so our I I I guess I'm still um
 
03:55:37.309 --> 03:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
fumbling around a little bit with the
 
03:55:39.990 --> 03:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
with the term educ ation
 
03:55:42.910 --> 03:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
agency um I know it was it was a new
 
03:55:45.149 --> 03:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
term to me when I first got on a school
 
03:55:48.030 --> 03:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
board and it was referred and our school
 
03:55:50.110 --> 03:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
district was referred to as the local
 
03:55:55.030 --> 03:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
Education Agency the Lea and and I seem
 
03:55:57.429 --> 03:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
to recall that that had a different
 
03:55:58.830 --> 03:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
level of
 
03:56:01.510 --> 03:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility um for certain things
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
than maybe um like a charter school and
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
so uh I guess is every school in
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
education agency and our non-public
 
03:56:13.870 --> 03:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
schools education agencies and do they
 
03:56:15.950 --> 03:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
take on additional responsibilities
 
03:56:18.309 --> 03:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
because they're education agencies
 
03:56:20.189 --> 03:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
instead of just
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
schools I think we would have to look at
 
03:56:24.229 --> 03:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
the definition of Education Agency in
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
state law so we should actually do that
 
03:56:28.990 --> 03:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
probably as part of this bill um as far
 
03:56:31.229 --> 03:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
as Federal funding is concerned Federal
 
03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
funding is used throughout federal law
 
03:56:34.990 --> 03:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
to talk about Education Agency and it's
 
03:56:36.590 --> 03:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
usually the person that's receiving the
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
funding for the V variety of different
 
03:56:41.189 --> 03:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
federal grants so for title one for
 
03:56:43.110 --> 03:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
example a charter school would be
 
03:56:45.149 --> 03:56:45.159 align:start position:0%
considered an Lea a local Education
 
03:56:48.110 --> 03:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
Agency no no different than a district
 
03:56:49.429 --> 03:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh District school would be because they
 
03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
both receive the funding and are
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
expected to say to follow the same
 
03:56:54.630 --> 03:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and requirements of the
 
03:56:57.269 --> 03:56:57.279 align:start position:0%
grant um there are certainly grants that
 
03:57:00.269 --> 03:57:00.279 align:start position:0%
don't go to all local education agencies
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
um for example a um uh title uh title
 
03:57:08.149 --> 03:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
five which is TW or TW title 4 a rather
 
03:57:09.990 --> 03:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
21st Century it only goes to very
 
03:57:13.389 --> 03:57:13.399 align:start position:0%
specific school districts um and so that
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
those would be leas for the purpose of
 
03:57:17.189 --> 03:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
that specific Grant and that specific
 
03:57:18.910 --> 03:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
requirement so essentially I think
 
03:57:20.590 --> 03:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
providing the Education Services
 
03:57:22.510 --> 03:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
required in that Grant but we can
 
03:57:23.990 --> 03:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
certainly look at the definition of both
 
03:57:25.510 --> 03:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
of those and maybe clarify that that
 
03:57:27.510 --> 03:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
might not be a bad idea okay thank
 
03:57:29.870 --> 03:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
thanks so much Kaitlyn thank thank you
 
03:57:37.349 --> 03:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
uh yeah represent you did have your hand
 
03:57:41.790 --> 03:57:41.800 align:start position:0%
up is it down
 
03:57:45.030 --> 03:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
now uh Mr chairman I just wanted to
 
03:57:46.830 --> 03:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
again just be be clear on this because
 
03:57:49.429 --> 03:57:49.439 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm new to this so a non-public
 
03:57:51.030 --> 03:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
Education Agency and then we have
 
03:57:53.590 --> 03:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
non-public school are they the same
 
03:57:58.110 --> 03:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:59.950 --> 03:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
simple mean I think they're being
 
03:57:59.960 --> 03:58:01.550 align:start position:0%
simple mean I think they're being
interchange

03:58:01.550 --> 03:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
interchange
 
03:58:03.550 --> 03:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
interchangeably used in this law
 
03:58:06.189 --> 03:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
currently so I maybe we should Define
 
03:58:08.389 --> 03:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
them for the purpose of the specific law
 
03:58:11.670 --> 03:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
um but so the word Education Agency was
 
03:58:13.269 --> 03:58:13.279 align:start position:0%
already in the law we just added the
 
03:58:15.510 --> 03:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
words nonpublic and charges to it and
 
03:58:18.269 --> 03:58:18.279 align:start position:0%
down below the word Education Agency did
 
03:58:21.710 --> 03:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
not exist so that was not added right no
 
03:58:23.790 --> 03:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I I I think your idea of
 
03:58:25.510 --> 03:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
clarification might be a good
 
03:58:29.590 --> 03:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
one thank you okay further hands uh
 
03:58:32.590 --> 03:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
represent leus I just want to make sure
 
03:58:35.429 --> 03:58:35.439 align:start position:0%
that I understand the section under
 
03:58:38.950 --> 03:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
nonpublic schools those are things that
 
03:58:41.830 --> 03:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
are already asked for or are there any
 
03:58:44.149 --> 03:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
new ones those are all things that are
 
03:58:45.790 --> 03:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
already asked for and um just for the
 
03:58:47.429 --> 03:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
committee purpose I just got
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
clarification from a staff member um on
 
03:58:52.389 --> 03:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
what is in the education statistics and
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
that's just general information so
 
03:58:55.990 --> 03:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's basically when we ask a school to
 
03:58:57.910 --> 03:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
review that their name is such and such
 
03:58:59.349 --> 03:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
school and their address is this and
 
03:59:01.149 --> 03:59:01.159 align:start position:0%
their principal is this and their add
 
03:59:02.670 --> 03:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
you know their phone number so that's
 
03:59:04.630 --> 03:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
the general information on the school in
 
03:59:06.510 --> 03:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
our database um so that's what's
 
03:59:08.670 --> 03:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
contained in that fall report but we did
 
03:59:11.550 --> 03:59:11.560 align:start position:0%
not ask um we did not use this bill to
 
03:59:13.710 --> 03:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
expand any reporting requirements that
 
03:59:15.670 --> 03:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
were not already in
 
03:59:19.389 --> 03:59:19.399 align:start position:0%

Region um Innovation
 
04:01:34.469 --> 04:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
schools uh we have often heard Charter
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
Schools being referred to as
 
04:01:39.429 --> 04:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
Laboratories of innovation
 
04:01:43.910 --> 04:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's basically in Statute in uh 194
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
B1 uh their statement of
 
04:01:50.110 --> 04:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
purpose is and I quote to exempt charter
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
schools from State statutes and rules
 
04:01:55.950 --> 04:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
other than where specified to provide
 
04:01:58.429 --> 04:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
Innovative learning and teaching in a
 
04:01:58.439 --> 04:02:00.590 align:start position:0%
Innovative learning and teaching in a
unique

04:02:00.590 --> 04:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
unique
 
04:02:04.349 --> 04:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
environment uh the question how do we
 
04:02:06.870 --> 04:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
allow traditional public schools to
 
04:02:10.510 --> 04:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:13.510 --> 04:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
609 establishes a process by which
 
04:02:16.070 --> 04:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
districts can request and obtain waivers
 
04:02:18.790 --> 04:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
from administrative rules from the state
 
04:02:22.429 --> 04:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
board and Innovative schools are not new
 
04:02:26.670 --> 04:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
uh Massachusetts Maine Colorado Etc um
 
04:02:29.950 --> 04:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
all have programs to allow innovation in
 
04:02:31.910 --> 04:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
their Public
 
04:02:34.269 --> 04:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
Schools according to the Center for
 
04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
Reinventing public education there were
 
04:02:39.630 --> 04:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
actually 14 States
 
04:02:41.710 --> 04:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
and some waivers even excuse me some
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
states even allow waivers from laws in
 
04:02:48.149 --> 04:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
addition to wavers uh which we are not
 
04:02:51.229 --> 04:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
doing uh I will point out that some
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
talking points have been passed around
 
04:02:57.990 --> 04:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill was given to me by Alec
 
04:02:59.830 --> 04:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
as model
 
04:03:02.469 --> 04:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
legislation uh we heard that charge last
 
04:03:04.830 --> 04:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
time I submitted this bill it's
 
04:03:08.229 --> 04:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
untrue it's a talking point the truth is
 
04:03:10.070 --> 04:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
is that I have looked
 
04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
at legislation from many of these states
 
04:03:16.590 --> 04:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
talk to people in Colorado in their
 
04:03:18.790 --> 04:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and work
 
04:03:23.389 --> 04:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
primarily from the legislation in
 
04:03:27.309 --> 04:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
Colorado um I want to make that clear
 
04:03:28.910 --> 04:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
because the point doesn't seem to be
 
04:03:30.349 --> 04:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
getting through to
 
04:03:33.269 --> 04:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
people uh the New Hampshire
 
04:03:37.030 --> 04:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
administrative rules are quite a volume
 
04:03:40.189 --> 04:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
the table of content contents is 24
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
pages long by
 
04:03:45.550 --> 04:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
itself uh I'd like to go through some
 
04:03:48.670 --> 04:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
sections of this bill to allow you to
 
04:03:52.590 --> 04:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
see um more about Innovative schools and
 
04:03:53.870 --> 04:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
how they are
 
04:03:57.389 --> 04:03:57.399 align:start position:0%
approved um in the definition sections
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
we have definitions for both Innovative
 
04:04:03.750 --> 04:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
school and Innovation Zone which would
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
allow uh for a school district and its
 
04:04:10.469 --> 04:04:10.479 align:start position:0%

that the uh public school would like to
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
implement and
 
04:05:11.149 --> 04:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
importantly the administrative rules
 
04:05:15.550 --> 04:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
from which the schools are requesting a
 
04:05:17.710 --> 04:05:17.720 align:start position:0%

programs and policies and documents
 
04:05:23.189 --> 04:05:23.199 align:start position:0%

include a number of things and that was
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
specified uh here and that would include
 
04:05:41.550 --> 04:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
things like uh an estimate of the

school uh
 
04:05:54.870 --> 04:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
Etc and each School Board would

going on to page four the local school
 
04:06:27.149 --> 04:06:27.159 align:start position:0%
board would submit uh their Innovations
 
04:06:29.510 --> 04:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
plans first to the department for review
 
04:06:32.830 --> 04:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
and comment the department would respond
 
04:06:35.670 --> 04:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
with any suggested uh suggested changes
 
04:06:38.030 --> 04:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
or additions to the plan back to the
 
04:06:40.870 --> 04:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
local board and then the local board
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
would submit the plan to the state board
 
04:06:46.110 --> 04:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
for review the state board has to hold a
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the
 
04:06:53.429 --> 04:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
plan uh the state board has 60 days to
 
04:06:56.830 --> 04:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh review that plan and either approve
 
04:06:58.429 --> 04:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
or reject the
 
04:07:01.389 --> 04:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
plan uh written explanation of the
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
decision is required to be presented to
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%

04:07:09.030 --> 04:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:07:11.550 --> 04:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
and I want to be clear as we pointed out
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
on page four that each district shall
 
04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
continue to be subject to all laws and
 
04:07:20.349 --> 04:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
rules that are not waved by the state
 
04:07:23.469 --> 04:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
board it's not a blanket waiver that uh
 
04:07:25.630 --> 04:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
is provided for
 
04:07:29.389 --> 04:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
here and in terms of accountability uh
 
04:07:32.950 --> 04:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
down the bottom of page four uh the
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
State Board uh reviews the uh state me
 
04:07:40.630 --> 04:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
the Innovation plans every two
 
04:07:40.640 --> 04:07:42.510 align:start position:0%
the Innovation plans every two
years

04:07:42.510 --> 04:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:07:45.389 --> 04:07:45.399 align:start position:0%
and that is based on a local Board
 
04:07:48.309 --> 04:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
review of the plan and whether they
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
believe that the uh Innovation plan is
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
working and that the uh improvements
 
04:07:59.830 --> 04:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
that were uh originally specified are
 
04:07:59.840 --> 04:08:02.229 align:start position:0%
that were uh originally specified are
being

04:08:02.229 --> 04:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:08:06.149 --> 04:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
realized this uh Department of Education
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
reviews the results of the local board
 
04:08:12.790 --> 04:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
plan the local board May at any time if
 
04:08:15.469 --> 04:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
they feel that the their plan is not
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
working revise the plan or notify the
 
04:08:22.109 --> 04:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
state board that they wish wish to uh
 
04:08:26.510 --> 04:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
terminate their um Innovation plan and
 
04:08:30.670 --> 04:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
um uh their request for waivers likewise
 
04:08:34.269 --> 04:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
the department if they feel that the uh
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
Innovation plan is not working and
 
04:08:39.750 --> 04:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
results are not there uh they may revoke
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
the U approval of the
 
04:08:45.870 --> 04:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
plan and uh there is a requirement does
 
04:08:48.030 --> 04:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
the State Board excuse me the Department
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
of Education uh provide an annual report
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
on uh any school that has an innovation
 
04:08:58.309 --> 04:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh plan accepted and you'll see on the
 
04:09:00.309 --> 04:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
bottom of page five a number of the
 
04:09:03.910 --> 04:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
areas that are required uh in the
 
04:09:08.269 --> 04:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
department um report to the legislature
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:09:15.109 --> 04:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
intent is that we give
 
04:09:18.750 --> 04:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility to traditional Public
 
04:09:24.229 --> 04:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
Schools uh I think that it is important
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
given what has gone on this past year um
 
04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
changes that are coming down the road
 
04:09:36.790 --> 04:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
um in all of Education to give schools
 
04:09:40.030 --> 04:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility on how they respond and how
 
04:09:43.830 --> 04:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
they can innovate uh isn't that what we
 
04:09:45.710 --> 04:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
all want we want schools to be able to
 
04:09:47.149 --> 04:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
innovate and
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
improve the provision for waivers from
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
administrative rules provides that
 
04:09:59.070 --> 04:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:05.309 --> 04:10:05.319 align:start position:0%
Schools the some opponents of this have
 
04:10:10.750 --> 04:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
um complained that uh the workers um
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
will not produce change and um will only
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh hurt Public Schools but we have
 
04:10:20.349 --> 04:10:20.359 align:start position:0%
Provisions in here for local public
 
04:10:22.510 --> 04:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
schools review the department review
 
04:10:26.590 --> 04:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
State Board review and at any point if
 
04:10:29.870 --> 04:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
it is seen that the results are not
 
04:10:33.229 --> 04:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
there program isn't working uh the
 
04:10:34.469 --> 04:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
program can be
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
terminated uh but we need to help all of
 
04:10:40.109 --> 04:10:40.119 align:start position:0%
our kids kids and through
 
04:10:43.109 --> 04:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
Innovation I think is one way we can do
 
04:10:45.750 --> 04:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
04:10:48.030 --> 04:10:48.040 align:start position:0%

04:11:05.910 --> 04:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:09.830 --> 04:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
do a school do in terms of what might be
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
an innovation and and a waiver that is
 
04:11:17.349 --> 04:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh maybe in terms of curriculum um you
 
04:11:20.109 --> 04:11:20.119 align:start position:0%
know we see public EXC me public
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
chartered schools uh innovate in terms
 
04:11:28.030 --> 04:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
of U uh their uh could be anything in
 
04:11:31.469 --> 04:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
terms of curriculum standards an area of
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
focus um uh I'd even um talked about a
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
charge school being started in my area
 
04:11:42.189 --> 04:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
um for agriculture they would have a
 
04:11:45.030 --> 04:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
different school year so there are all
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh administrative rules on
 
04:11:50.030 --> 04:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
these areas and uh we just want to give
 
04:11:53.349 --> 04:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
schools flexibility um and I think uh
 
04:11:55.590 --> 04:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
someone from the Department uh also
 
04:11:58.349 --> 04:11:58.359 align:start position:0%

uh my question concerns 194 E2 Roman
 
04:12:21.870 --> 04:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
numeral 3 h no I'm sorry yes H that's
 
04:12:25.710 --> 04:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
the the part that talks about waving any
 
04:12:27.870 --> 04:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
provision of a collective bargaining
 
04:12:30.870 --> 04:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
agreement if the local school board had
 
04:12:33.910 --> 04:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
recently signed a collective bargaining
 
04:12:36.590 --> 04:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
agreement with the teachers and had
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
agreed to certain wages salaries and
 
04:12:40.990 --> 04:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
work conditions could they then turn
 
04:12:42.790 --> 04:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
around and decide they're going to ask
 
04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
for a waiver of that collective
 
04:12:46.990 --> 04:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement for people who were
 
04:12:50.670 --> 04:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
teaching at this new Innovative school
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
um maybe direct me uh I didn't catch
 
04:12:57.950 --> 04:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
where you were looking uh it's 194 E2 uh
 
04:13:00.510 --> 04:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
3 H bottom of page
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:14.950 --> 04:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
yes right
 
04:13:21.830 --> 04:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
if right it's in the U the plan um uh
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
has to include programs or documents
 
04:13:28.309 --> 04:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
that would be affected by The Innovation
 
04:13:31.269 --> 04:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
um they would have in the plan they
 
04:13:34.590 --> 04:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
would have outline if the requested
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
waiver or innovation plan did affect any
 
04:13:41.229 --> 04:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement we're not talking
 
04:13:43.550 --> 04:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
about getting a waiver from a bargaining
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
agreement or labor agreement we're
 
04:13:48.870 --> 04:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
talking about um just uh that has to be
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
included in the plan that is presented
 
04:13:53.830 --> 04:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
to the local school board anything that
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
might be impacted by the
 
04:14:01.149 --> 04:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
request followup Mr chairman yes
 
04:14:04.510 --> 04:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
represent uh then going back to the
 
04:14:07.630 --> 04:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
example I used before uh if if a school
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
district chose to pay teachers in an
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
Innovative program less than it was
 
04:14:13.830 --> 04:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
paying the regular school teachers under
 
04:14:15.670 --> 04:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining agreement they
 
04:14:20.469 --> 04:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:25.109 --> 04:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
waiver I I think that uh if the uh
 
04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
School administration was requesting
 
04:14:30.790 --> 04:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
going back into negotiation with the
 
04:14:33.710 --> 04:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
Union that it would be included in the
 
04:14:35.950 --> 04:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
plan that that was part of the plan that
 
04:14:37.670 --> 04:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
they were going to renegotiate negotiate
 
04:14:37.680 --> 04:14:38.630 align:start position:0%
they were going to renegotiate negotiate
an

04:14:38.630 --> 04:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:14:41.630 --> 04:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
agreement it does not give uh the
 
04:14:45.269 --> 04:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
district part blanch in terms of um
 
04:14:48.389 --> 04:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
modifying a labor agreement it's just
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
notifying the school board that um part
 
04:14:53.910 --> 04:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
of the plan would be um looking at a
 
04:14:53.920 --> 04:14:55.510 align:start position:0%
of the plan would be um looking at a
labor

04:14:55.510 --> 04:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
labor
 
04:14:59.910 --> 04:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
agreement I I don't see um uh instances
 
04:15:02.910 --> 04:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
U where that would happen uh but uh it
 
04:15:05.149 --> 04:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
would have to be provided for and
 
04:15:09.109 --> 04:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:09.119 --> 04:15:10.030 align:start position:0%

cordelli I am on page two Roman numeral
 
04:15:34.389 --> 04:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
three which is line five the section
 
04:15:37.790 --> 04:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
that says each Innovation plan may
 
04:15:41.670 --> 04:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
include the following information so uh
 
04:15:46.990 --> 04:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
just as a general comment I um am
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
affected by how many times the word may
 
04:15:52.349 --> 04:15:52.359 align:start position:0%
appears in the document as opposed to
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
shall um just because we know that when
 
04:15:57.910 --> 04:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about reporting things out
 
04:16:00.149 --> 04:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
that there's a world of difference
 
04:16:02.510 --> 04:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
between May and shell but in this
 
04:16:08.349 --> 04:16:08.359 align:start position:0%
particular section um I'm looking at
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
the things that the the list of things
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
that may be waved as part of this
 
04:16:17.950 --> 04:16:17.960 align:start position:0%

04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just following down in that section
 
04:16:47.830 --> 04:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:52.990 --> 04:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
plan I is it possible that somebody in
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
designing such an Innovative school
 
04:16:58.510 --> 04:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
would be requesting
 
04:17:02.790 --> 04:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
that all of those things be waved
 
04:17:06.149 --> 04:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
or a preponderance of those things I I
 
04:17:09.309 --> 04:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I I guess I'm wondering how we
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
determine where we're giving up the
 
04:17:15.189 --> 04:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
pieces that the State Board of Education
 
04:17:17.550 --> 04:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
have determined our part of an essential
 
04:17:20.070 --> 04:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
and adequate
 
04:17:23.070 --> 04:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
education I I'm I'm just wondering where
 
04:17:25.630 --> 04:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
the where the uh the breaks are if you
 
04:17:29.349 --> 04:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
will on how much the breaks are four
 
04:17:33.070 --> 04:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
different places there with are five
 
04:17:33.080 --> 04:17:33.950 align:start position:0%
different places there with are five

Education at every step in the process
 
04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are breaks that can be
 
04:17:50.469 --> 04:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
applied could I'm just gonna follow up
 
04:17:54.910 --> 04:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
on that if I if I I'm sorry go ahead uh
 
04:17:57.590 --> 04:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
so when you say that that they would
 
04:18:00.229 --> 04:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
apply breaks would that be just in the
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
form of denying a request for something
 
04:18:04.229 --> 04:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:18:07.870 --> 04:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
waved uh the uh included in the bill is
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
the provision for the Department of
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%

uh the department can make

recommendations for changes or
 
04:18:25.469 --> 04:18:25.479 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman lab but I was I was

at the end of the line I'll let
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
represent Milo go first that's okay okay
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
Mel uh thank you uh Mr chairman uh a
 
04:18:50.070 --> 04:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
couple things first of all I hope that
 
04:18:54.030 --> 04:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
the uh title of this bill is not denying
 
04:18:56.469 --> 04:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
that there's uh Innovations going on in
 
04:18:58.469 --> 04:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
schools on a daily basis in this state
 
04:19:00.750 --> 04:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why we rank in the top five
 
04:19:03.469 --> 04:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
in the country the two questions I have
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
for clarification uh representative
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
cordelli is this
 
04:19:10.469 --> 04:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
uh first of all as I've looked at
 
04:19:12.870 --> 04:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
Innovation schools one of the things one
 
04:19:15.389 --> 04:19:15.399 align:start position:0%
of the pieces of legislation that I see
 
04:19:19.070 --> 04:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
common in in the language is the ability
 
04:19:23.229 --> 04:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
of the staff in a particular school to
 
04:19:25.349 --> 04:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
vote on whether or not they want to
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
become an Innovative school and in most
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
cases it's about 60% if 60% of the staff
 
04:19:33.389 --> 04:19:33.399 align:start position:0%
vote on it then it's fine if not then
 
04:19:35.790 --> 04:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
it's denied so that's one the one
 
04:19:38.750 --> 04:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
question I have is why wasn't there a
 
04:19:41.910 --> 04:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
vote in your bill uh regarding the
 
04:19:43.790 --> 04:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
incumbent staff of that particular
 
04:19:46.790 --> 04:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
school that's question one question two
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
is is there an implication here that in
 
04:19:52.590 --> 04:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
the Innovative School said it's possible
 
04:19:55.950 --> 04:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
to hire non-certified teachers to be in
 
04:19:57.910 --> 04:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
that Innovative school so those two are
 
04:20:00.269 --> 04:20:00.279 align:start position:0%
my two questions thank
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
you um first of all I I think that
 
04:20:09.389 --> 04:20:09.399 align:start position:0%
um the onus is put on the school ad
 
04:20:11.710 --> 04:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
School administration and the local
 
04:20:14.030 --> 04:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
school board uh to come up and approve
 
04:20:14.040 --> 04:20:15.389 align:start position:0%
school board uh to come up and approve
the

04:20:15.389 --> 04:20:15.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:18.429 --> 04:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
plan uh the local school board are the
 
04:20:21.429 --> 04:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
local Representatives um of the people
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that uh all School
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
administration uh takes uh staff uh into
 
04:20:33.670 --> 04:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
consideration uh in terms of your second
 
04:20:35.870 --> 04:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
question was if you could repeat that
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
please certified staff oh the second
 
04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
question is whether or not you can hire
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
non-certified staff to be in an
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
Innovative school or do they have to be
 
04:20:43.359 --> 04:20:46.070 align:start position:0%
Innovative school or do they have to be
certified

04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:46.080 --> 04:20:48.550 align:start position:0%
 
teachers

04:20:48.550 --> 04:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh the uh bill is not uh referring
 
04:20:55.229 --> 04:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
specifically to certified or
 
04:20:58.070 --> 04:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
non-certified staff but generally to
 
04:21:01.990 --> 04:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
administrative rules so uh
 
04:21:04.229 --> 04:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
conceivably um there are many
 
04:21:06.790 --> 04:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that could be
 
04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
considered U for wer
 
04:21:15.229 --> 04:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
request um uh I know we've heard um
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh uh the need for U uh
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
nurses or Librarians if there's a
 
04:21:25.510 --> 04:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
library across the street uh there might
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
be waivers uh requested there um there's
 
04:21:31.349 --> 04:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
all sorts of possibilities but the idea
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
is to uh allow schools to have some
 
04:21:35.439 --> 04:21:37.070 align:start position:0%
is to uh allow schools to have some
flexibility

04:21:37.070 --> 04:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
04:21:38.950 --> 04:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
with the breaks that we've talked about
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
all the way up the line to the State
 
04:21:42.510 --> 04:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
04:21:45.269 --> 04:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
Education so the answer that to my
 
04:21:47.550 --> 04:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
second question is
 
04:21:50.269 --> 04:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
yes there's nothing in the bill to
 
04:21:52.429 --> 04:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
prohibit that's okay thank you that's
 
04:21:54.550 --> 04:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
all I needed thank you very
 
04:21:57.710 --> 04:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
much okay next in the queue I guess
 
04:21:59.950 --> 04:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
that's you
 
04:22:02.070 --> 04:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
Steve thank you represent I appreciate
 
04:22:04.149 --> 04:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
that represent qu thank thank you for
 
04:22:05.429 --> 04:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward I have I have a
 
04:22:08.309 --> 04:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
couple questions and and represent Miler
 
04:22:10.149 --> 04:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
caught one of them already so and as did
 
04:22:12.750 --> 04:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
representative Mullen uh you talked
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
about the flexibility that this program
 
04:22:18.269 --> 04:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
gives to Public Schools um like many on
 
04:22:19.710 --> 04:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
the board including those sitting around
 
04:22:21.990 --> 04:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
the table down there where you are today
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
um I've been an administrator in Maine
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Massachusetts all at
 
04:22:29.710 --> 04:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
the high school level and nothing
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
precluded me in any of those three
 
04:22:34.429 --> 04:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
states uh of bringing uh Innovation and
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility within the curricula for the
 
04:22:39.229 --> 04:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
program in my school so I'm trying to
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
Sugg why figure out why this actually is
 
04:22:44.590 --> 04:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
a needed bill um it's up to the
 
04:22:45.990 --> 04:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
leadership in each school to do that I
 
04:22:47.830 --> 04:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
would think I mean nothing stop that
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's question one if I and save
 
04:22:53.469 --> 04:22:53.479 align:start position:0%
time I'll ask question two and three
 
04:22:55.070 --> 04:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
secondly when you were describing the
 
04:22:57.269 --> 04:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
the Traditional School flexibility you
 
04:22:58.910 --> 04:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
kept on using the word chat school and I
 
04:23:01.469 --> 04:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
was trying to to find why that was the
 
04:23:04.389 --> 04:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
example instead of innovative school and
 
04:23:05.830 --> 04:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
thirdly under the top of the bill where
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
it says FN and L what is the FN and L
 
04:23:11.109 --> 04:23:11.119 align:start position:0%
actually going to cost us those three
 
04:23:12.309 --> 04:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
there's three questions there Mr
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:23.269 --> 04:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
me uh the LBA was unable to uh complete
 
04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal analysis I don't know if it's
 
04:23:29.710 --> 04:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
going to cost uh the state anything
 
04:23:33.030 --> 04:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm not sure where it would cost uh
 
04:23:36.870 --> 04:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
the state uh to Grant a uh waiver
 
04:23:39.590 --> 04:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
but in terms of U
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
Innovation we always hear about Charter
 
04:23:44.269 --> 04:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
Schools being Laboratories of
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
information and one reason is because um
 
04:23:50.070 --> 04:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
because they don't have to follow all
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
the administrative regular Public
 
04:23:55.990 --> 04:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
Schools do if if that's not the case um
 
04:23:58.550 --> 04:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know I I'll stand corrected but I've
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
always heard that argument being made
 
04:24:07.510 --> 04:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
um so I think that uh giving flexibility
 
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
to Public Schools will only help Public
 
04:24:12.990 --> 04:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
Schools uh can Public Schools uh
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
innovate without requested waivers sure
 
04:24:19.630 --> 04:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
I imagine they can and I know they can
 
04:24:21.510 --> 04:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
but are there going to be instances
 
04:24:25.349 --> 04:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
where uh waivers stand in the way of
 
04:24:30.149 --> 04:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:33.109 --> 04:24:33.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely follow follow up Mr chairman
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
yes follow up representa Woodcock thank
 
04:24:38.630 --> 04:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
you and and Rell I understand your your
 
04:24:41.149 --> 04:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
belief of child schools being being the
 
04:24:43.950 --> 04:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
Epic of innovation uh epicenter of
 
04:24:47.030 --> 04:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
innovation and and suggesting not that's
 
04:24:49.309 --> 04:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
fine I have no problem with that but I
 
04:24:51.550 --> 04:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
don't understand how if the child
 
04:24:54.189 --> 04:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
schools are so successful doing that why
 
04:24:56.189 --> 04:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
we need to have an Innovative Public
 
04:24:58.030 --> 04:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
School in the traditional public school
 
04:25:00.189 --> 04:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
we have the option instead of making the
 
04:25:02.429 --> 04:25:02.439 align:start position:0%
rule for the exception why not make it
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
for the general population I don't
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
understand that it's like just seems to
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
me like you're saying to public school
 
04:25:09.510 --> 04:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
teachers and administrators we don't
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
think you're really very Innovative and
 
04:25:14.030 --> 04:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
creative uh in your leadership and your
 
04:25:16.870 --> 04:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
teaching um that that that that part
 
04:25:19.149 --> 04:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
concerns me I think the opportunity is
 
04:25:20.870 --> 04:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
there without going through this whole
 
04:25:26.189 --> 04:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
bill um that's all thank you Mr chairman
 
04:25:28.389 --> 04:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
question no that was just more of a
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:36.070 --> 04:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
L thank you Mr chairman uh and thank
 
04:25:38.109 --> 04:25:38.119 align:start position:0%

things are not submitted does that
 
04:26:26.590 --> 04:26:26.600 align:start position:0%

limits in terms of the May those are
 
04:27:18.870 --> 04:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
spelling out some of the things that
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%

Innovation plan is wide open in terms of

04:27:35.070 --> 04:27:35.080 align:start position:0%

included in the in Innovation plan that
 
04:27:40.309 --> 04:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
they want to actually do and specific
 
04:27:43.070 --> 04:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
waivers uh the actual administrative
 
04:27:45.269 --> 04:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
rule that they would request the waiver
 
04:27:48.349 --> 04:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
from must be
 
04:27:53.070 --> 04:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
specified followup please yes thank you
 
04:27:56.109 --> 04:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
um does the Department of
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
Education have the
 
04:27:58.439 --> 04:28:00.109 align:start position:0%
Education have the
authority

04:28:00.109 --> 04:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
authority
 
04:28:02.830 --> 04:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
to agree to
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
wave provisions of collective bargaining
 
04:28:05.279 --> 04:28:08.389 align:start position:0%
wave provisions of collective bargaining
agreements

04:28:08.389 --> 04:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:11.030 --> 04:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
because the plan is going to ultimately
 
04:28:14.070 --> 04:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:18.990 --> 04:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
Education uh I I do not believe so um
 
04:28:21.269 --> 04:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
you can ask the department of uh
 
04:28:23.910 --> 04:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
education uh attorney but I don't
 
04:28:26.349 --> 04:28:26.359 align:start position:0%
believe so I think that would be uh
 
04:28:28.990 --> 04:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
between the uh bargaining bargaining
 
04:28:32.070 --> 04:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
unit and the uh District that signed the
 
04:28:34.670 --> 04:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
agreement thank you can I may I ask one
 
04:28:36.950 --> 04:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
more question Mr chairman
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um going to near the end of
 
04:28:43.189 --> 04:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
the bill um if the uh Department this is
 
04:28:45.630 --> 04:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education finds that
 
04:28:48.670 --> 04:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
Innovation plan performance is not
 
04:28:51.109 --> 04:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
satisfactory they shall notify the local
 
04:28:54.389 --> 04:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
board in the State Board um what would
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
be the metrics that would be used by the
 
04:29:00.229 --> 04:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to determine
 
04:29:03.269 --> 04:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
whether the Innovation plan is meeting
 
04:29:07.950 --> 04:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
um uh is is its performance is or is not
 
04:29:10.109 --> 04:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
satisfactory I think that would go back
 
04:29:14.109 --> 04:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
to the uh original plan and the uh uh
 
04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
goals and mission of the plan what they
 
04:29:18.550 --> 04:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to accomplish and if they weren't
 
04:29:21.229 --> 04:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
accomplishing uh those goals the local
 
04:29:24.269 --> 04:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
board can um pull the plug on the
 
04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
Innovation plan and the state board can
 
04:29:30.389 --> 04:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh revoke the plan as well thank you
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome uh representa
 
04:29:37.630 --> 04:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you Mr chair um I'm
 
04:29:40.950 --> 04:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about the fiscal note um that
 
04:29:43.349 --> 04:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock kind of uh
 
04:29:46.469 --> 04:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
brought up because whenever I see local
 
04:29:48.590 --> 04:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh what pops into my mind is higher
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
property taxes um and I noticed there's
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh the LBA is not able to to complete a
 
04:29:59.229 --> 04:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for this bill because it's a
 
04:30:01.070 --> 04:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
waiting information from the Department
 
04:30:01.080 --> 04:30:01.950 align:start position:0%
waiting information from the Department
of

04:30:01.950 --> 04:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
Education um and I know also all right
 
04:30:11.070 --> 04:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
I took to heart your um theory that it
 
04:30:13.149 --> 04:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to cost the schools uh the
 
04:30:15.550 --> 04:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
local communities anything or the state
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
anybody here no hey uh represent
 
04:30:21.070 --> 04:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
represent ten we're having a difficult
 
04:30:23.149 --> 04:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
time hearing you can you speak either a
 
04:30:27.389 --> 04:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
out we having a hard time hearing you uh
 
04:30:33.389 --> 04:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
Linda is that better it's a little bit
 
04:30:36.070 --> 04:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
better can folks here go ahead say
 
04:30:38.030 --> 04:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
something okay I think my I think my
 
04:30:40.710 --> 04:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
headphones are dying at this point uh
 
04:30:43.630 --> 04:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
can you hear it or not
 
04:30:46.670 --> 04:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
no no rep several Representatives you
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.030 --> 04:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
the can you hear me now yes
 
04:31:00.229 --> 04:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
yes that's better much
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay all right um
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
so uh what I'm concerned about is the
 
04:31:09.990 --> 04:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note at the endend whenever I see
 
04:31:13.189 --> 04:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
local I always think of property taxes
 
04:31:16.590 --> 04:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
going up and I realized that the LBA the
 
04:31:18.830 --> 04:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
note on the end says the LBA is unable
 
04:31:21.469 --> 04:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
to complete a fiscal note for this as
 
04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's waiting awaiting information from
 
04:31:26.349 --> 04:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education um I think
 
04:31:28.189 --> 04:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
it would be really important in this day
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
and age to uh not make a decision on
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
this bill until we get a an idea of some
 
04:31:35.279 --> 04:31:36.469 align:start position:0%
this bill until we get a an idea of some
sort

04:31:36.469 --> 04:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
sort
 
04:31:38.710 --> 04:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
what effect this has not only on the
 
04:31:41.189 --> 04:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
state but more importantly on the local
 
04:31:44.710 --> 04:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayer um and so uh I'm wondering if
 
04:31:47.189 --> 04:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
you have any idea when that information
 
04:31:49.950 --> 04:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
available uh that's if that's a question
 
04:31:57.790 --> 04:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:00.309 --> 04:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
it if that's a question to me I have not
 
04:32:03.950 --> 04:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
talked to the department about uh um
 
04:32:09.790 --> 04:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:14.469 --> 04:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:18.109 --> 04:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
you I I did speak with uh Caitlyn Davis
 
04:32:19.790 --> 04:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
just yesterday regarding these fiscal
 
04:32:23.710 --> 04:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
notes and and as you can well believe
 
04:32:26.510 --> 04:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
that she's underwater trying to with her
 
04:32:29.469 --> 04:32:29.479 align:start position:0%
staff uh she has some folks that an
 
04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
individual came over from the LBA is
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
working with her now Mark is there
 
04:32:36.269 --> 04:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
however she she's hopeful of getting
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
some of this out to as quickly as she
 
04:32:39.790 --> 04:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
can I'm not going to try to give you any
 
04:32:43.790 --> 04:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:47.229 --> 04:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
it okay the next person that let's see
 
04:32:50.109 --> 04:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
Linda you spoke and Doug this Doug are
 
04:32:52.389 --> 04:32:52.399 align:start position:0%

up okay uh how about you Mr Woodcock yes
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
one final question for me Mr
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
chairman representative cordelli uh
 
04:33:04.949 --> 04:33:04.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for one more question here do
 
04:33:06.349 --> 04:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
you know of
 
04:33:10.390 --> 04:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
any public schools that have not allowed
 
04:33:11.810 --> 04:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
to become
 
04:33:11.820 --> 04:33:14.390 align:start position:0%
to become
[Music]

04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:33:16.910 --> 04:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
Innovative um I have not taken a survey
 
04:33:22.269 --> 04:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
of public schools in that regard um as I
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
said before I am sure there are
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
Innovations going on in New Hampshire
 
04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
Public Schools I am trying to allow them
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
greater flexibility uh to
 
04:33:36.869 --> 04:33:36.879 align:start position:0%
innovate thank you Mr chairman
 
04:33:39.590 --> 04:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm not seeing any more
 
04:33:43.590 --> 04:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
hands remote and I don't see but we have
 
04:33:45.470 --> 04:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn Davis that would like to get
 
04:33:48.230 --> 04:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
back on so I'm gonna ask Caitlyn uh
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
could you please come on and maybe
 
04:33:51.470 --> 04:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
explain to us a little bit about where
 
04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
you stand with all these Financial notes
 
04:33:54.551 --> 04:33:54.561 align:start position:0%
you're trying to
 
04:33:57.230 --> 04:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
develop absolutely so um I think all of
 
04:33:58.990 --> 04:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes at least have been sent
 
04:34:01.551 --> 04:34:01.561 align:start position:0%
over to the LBA at this point um so you
 
04:34:04.230 --> 04:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
should be seeing those appearing um
 
04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
specifically for this though um and um
 
04:34:10.990 --> 04:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
Jen if you could uh promote Nate green
 
04:34:13.029 --> 04:34:13.039 align:start position:0%
to speaker as well he's here to talk
 
04:34:15.269 --> 04:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
about the educational aspects of this
 
04:34:17.670 --> 04:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
bill if you have any specific questions
 
04:34:19.349 --> 04:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
um for the fiscal note of this bill
 
04:34:21.709 --> 04:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
though the the department did put that
 
04:34:24.390 --> 04:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
it was Zero because there is no
 
04:34:28.269 --> 04:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
requirement for this so you know the
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
point of a fiscal bill is if if there's
 
04:34:32.830 --> 04:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
a new law that's passing that requires a
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
school district to do something like you
 
04:34:37.750 --> 04:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
know provide a different addition
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
additional services or something like
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
that um that's when we would say there
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
is a cost but because it's not required
 
04:34:46.869 --> 04:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
and it's optional it's there is no
 
04:34:48.670 --> 04:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
specific cost relative to the bill for
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
local costs um we did um assign a cost
 
04:34:55.750 --> 04:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh an indeterminable slash you know cost
 
04:34:58.269 --> 04:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
of one position at the department
 
04:35:00.269 --> 04:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
because you know in the first couple
 
04:35:01.750 --> 04:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
years you know while a couple of these
 
04:35:03.070 --> 04:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
are getting off the ground just like
 
04:35:04.709 --> 04:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools we may not need a
 
04:35:06.349 --> 04:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
specific position at the Department of
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
Education to oversee these schools
 
04:35:11.390 --> 04:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
however if there are many or many many
 
04:35:13.029 --> 04:35:13.039 align:start position:0%
of these schools that the department of
 
04:35:15.230 --> 04:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
education does need to oversee um we
 
04:35:16.830 --> 04:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
would need a full-time position just
 
04:35:18.429 --> 04:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
like we have a full-time Charter School
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
administrator or a full-time non-public
 
04:35:22.310 --> 04:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
school administrator um so that was our
 
04:35:23.869 --> 04:35:23.879 align:start position:0%
cost that we had did ass sign for the
 
04:35:25.109 --> 04:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but we did say that there
 
04:35:27.629 --> 04:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
were no no local costs that were
 
04:35:30.029 --> 04:35:30.039 align:start position:0%
required because it is not a required
 
04:35:32.990 --> 04:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
that Local Schools do
 
04:35:36.949 --> 04:35:36.959 align:start position:0%
this are there questions of okay
 
04:35:39.510 --> 04:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
I see represent
 
04:35:42.629 --> 04:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
Ellison uh thank you I it's actually for
 
04:35:45.150 --> 04:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsor so I can I hold off on
 
04:35:47.949 --> 04:35:47.959 align:start position:0%
that yes you may um are there any
 
04:35:50.429 --> 04:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
specific questions for Caitlyn again or
 
04:35:51.750 --> 04:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
she explained where we are with the
 
04:35:53.470 --> 04:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
financial notes in the
 
04:35:58.910 --> 04:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:58.920 --> 04:36:00.429 align:start position:0%
 
Caitlyn

04:36:00.429 --> 04:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn
 
04:36:03.070 --> 04:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
um oh there's okay we have another
 
04:36:04.750 --> 04:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
individual from the Department that's
 
04:36:07.070 --> 04:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
got on over there with her Christopher
 
04:36:10.750 --> 04:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
Bond so um will you please hang on to
 
04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%

you yes hi this is Chris Bond thank you
 
04:36:23.269 --> 04:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
um I did just want to respond to um one
 
04:36:25.109 --> 04:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
question that I think uh representative
 
04:36:28.269 --> 04:36:28.279 align:start position:0%
Lei had asked um about uh collective
 
04:36:29.629 --> 04:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements and I just wanted
 
04:36:31.390 --> 04:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
to clarify that the department does not
 
04:36:34.349 --> 04:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
believe it has the authority to wave
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
Provisions in colle ctive bargaining
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
agreements um nor do we read this
 
04:36:40.070 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation as purporting to
 
04:36:41.310 --> 04:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
give that authority to either the
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
department or the board um the state
 
04:36:46.310 --> 04:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
board that is um and then with that
 
04:36:49.949 --> 04:36:49.959 align:start position:0%
comment I'm I just I'd be happy to uh
 
04:36:51.709 --> 04:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
make myself available for any questions
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
if any anyone has any questions about
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
the Department's perspective although I
 
04:36:56.990 --> 04:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
know Caitlyn has already spoken to the
 
04:36:57.000 --> 04:36:57.990 align:start position:0%
know Caitlyn has already spoken to the
fiscal

04:36:57.990 --> 04:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
04:36:59.789 --> 04:36:59.799 align:start position:0%
issues well thank you very much
 
04:37:01.269 --> 04:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
Christopher I think that really nails
 
04:37:02.949 --> 04:37:02.959 align:start position:0%
down that one where the department does
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
not have authority and that's between
 
04:37:08.429 --> 04:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
the locals so
 
04:37:11.109 --> 04:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you very much we're going to
 
04:37:12.789 --> 04:37:12.799 align:start position:0%
go on some other questioning so we can
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
move on this a little
 
04:37:17.551 --> 04:37:17.561 align:start position:0%
bit uh representa
 
04:37:20.230 --> 04:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
Ellison uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:37:22.629 --> 04:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli for uh
 
04:37:25.390 --> 04:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think I'm on page
 
04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
three uh Roman numeral 5 C which talks
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
about provision of services included but
 
04:37:35.390 --> 04:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
not limited to special education syst
 
04:37:37.830 --> 04:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
Services as I read the introductory
 
04:37:39.949 --> 04:37:39.959 align:start position:0%
paragraph at the the bottom of the page
 
04:37:43.629 --> 04:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
before it says this an application for a
 
04:37:47.310 --> 04:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
school may include references to a whole
 
04:37:50.750 --> 04:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
lot of things I guess my question is is
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
specifically in C where it says limited
 
04:37:56.230 --> 04:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
to it's not limited to special education
 
04:38:00.189 --> 04:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
services could a uh an application for
 
04:38:02.789 --> 04:38:02.799 align:start position:0%
an Innovative School decide that they
 
04:38:05.629 --> 04:38:05.639 align:start position:0%

04:38:07.029 --> 04:38:07.039 align:start position:0%
requirements in terms of special

granting any waivers from Federal
 
04:38:20.590 --> 04:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:25.990 --> 04:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.920 --> 04:38:38.949 align:start position:0%
 
Hanner

04:38:38.949 --> 04:38:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%

anti-discrimination
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
no as I said in the introduction um some
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%

luno
 
04:39:38.230 --> 04:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair uh just to
 
04:39:41.230 --> 04:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
clarify um representative cordell's um
 
04:39:43.030 --> 04:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
last statement waivers from
 
04:39:45.310 --> 04:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
administrative rules only you would be
 
04:39:46.590 --> 04:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
talking about waivers from
 
04:39:49.830 --> 04:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that do not have a
 
04:39:55.110 --> 04:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
correct administrative rules yes um
 
04:40:01.910 --> 04:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're not know the bill does not provide
 
04:40:06.070 --> 04:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
for um uh waving you know
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
193 um C12 pupil assessments for
 
04:40:12.030 --> 04:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
instance there's no provision for doing
 
04:40:14.628 --> 04:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
something like that right F follow up on
 
04:40:17.948 --> 04:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair yes how however my
 
04:40:20.948 --> 04:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
understanding from jelar is that
 
04:40:23.510 --> 04:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
administrative rules have to have a
 
04:40:27.070 --> 04:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
structural foundation in statute and
 
04:40:30.510 --> 04:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
that the burden is on the department to
 
04:40:33.670 --> 04:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
make that connection when Hello bringing
 
04:40:35.550 --> 04:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
bringing rules before J
 
04:40:38.990 --> 04:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
elar so so I guess what I'm what
 
04:40:43.470 --> 04:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
I'm getting some somebody's voice I I am
 
04:40:46.590 --> 04:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm saying then is uh isn't
 
04:40:48.590 --> 04:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
therefore an a waiver from an
 
04:40:50.990 --> 04:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
administrative rule the same thing as
 
04:40:53.830 --> 04:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
waving something that the legislature
 
04:40:56.708 --> 04:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
and the governor intended to be in
 
04:41:01.750 --> 04:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:05.628 --> 04:41:05.638 align:start position:0%

uh in May if I may share with you of
 
04:42:22.150 --> 04:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
2018 a school voucher bill Senate Bill
 
04:42:24.070 --> 04:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
193 was
 
04:42:27.750 --> 04:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
killed now here we are in January of
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
2021 and a flurry of American
 
04:42:33.070 --> 04:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
legislative exchange Council pattern
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
bills are coming through the the New
 
04:42:34.798 --> 04:42:35.868 align:start position:0%
bills are coming through the the New
Hampshire

04:42:35.868 --> 04:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:42:38.550 --> 04:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
legislature all of these bills reflect
 
04:42:41.910 --> 04:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
an anti-public School bias cloaked in
 
04:42:45.590 --> 04:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
all kinds of language such as
 
04:42:48.670 --> 04:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
Innovation which is meant to deflect and
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
deny anti-public School
 
04:42:54.150 --> 04:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
bias House Bill
 
04:42:58.708 --> 04:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
609 is one of these bills supposedly it
 
04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
is meant to establish Innovation schools
 
04:43:05.708 --> 04:43:05.718 align:start position:0%
but taxpayers like myself can reasonably
 
04:43:10.150 --> 04:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
ask are Innovation schools necessary
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
given that we are already providing
 
04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
support for many charter schools which
 
04:43:18.910 --> 04:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
provide a variety of avenues for
 
04:43:21.390 --> 04:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
Innovation and our state recently
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
accepted a Federal grant to establish
 
04:43:27.948 --> 04:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
many more charter schools and to Second
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
what I've heard from committee members
 
04:43:34.470 --> 04:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
public schools are Innovative I know
 
04:43:36.350 --> 04:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
because I taught in them I was a
 
04:43:38.190 --> 04:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
director of a gifted and talented
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
program the first one in hener New
 
04:43:42.550 --> 04:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I'm here to
 
04:43:45.390 --> 04:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
say exciting things have happened for
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
years and are happening now Innovation
 
04:43:51.230 --> 04:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
is happening in our schools so what is
 
04:43:54.628 --> 04:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
House Bill 609 really seeking to
 
04:43:58.190 --> 04:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
accomplish it's seeking to siphon
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
away more money from public schools and
 
04:44:03.070 --> 04:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
to place it in the hands of those who
 
04:44:04.990 --> 04:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
will establish programs
 
04:44:08.430 --> 04:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
which will not be subject to rigorous
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
public scrutiny or regulation as with
 
04:44:11.440 --> 04:44:12.270 align:start position:0%
public scrutiny or regulation as with
school

04:44:12.270 --> 04:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
vouchers my public tax dollars could
 
04:44:18.990 --> 04:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
then be used by entities with seriously
 
04:44:22.430 --> 04:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
limited public oversight Thomas
 
04:44:25.230 --> 04:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
Jefferson was convinced that locally
 
04:44:27.150 --> 04:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
controlled Public Schools were key
 
04:44:29.948 --> 04:44:29.958 align:start position:0%
Democratic institutions and adlay
 
04:44:32.830 --> 04:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
Stevenson remarked that and I quote the
 
04:44:35.350 --> 04:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
free public school system is the most
 
04:44:38.470 --> 04:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
American thing about America America
 
04:44:42.190 --> 04:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
itself was and isair my second
 
04:44:45.550 --> 04:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
question represent Huff sent a sent us a
 
04:44:48.110 --> 04:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
letter which we want be in the permanent
 
04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
record and just in the past has been
 
04:44:52.150 --> 04:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
kind of hard to find these permanent
 
04:44:56.310 --> 04:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
records but thanks certain C uh some
 
04:44:58.070 --> 04:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
changes how we handle it
 
04:45:02.628 --> 04:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
so to represent Huff or
 
04:45:05.350 --> 04:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
somebody she
 
04:45:05.360 --> 04:45:10.510 align:start position:0%
somebody she

04:46:12.868 --> 04:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's idea of
 
04:46:15.310 --> 04:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
lessening some of the regulatory burdens
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
um on school districts that may um serve
 
04:46:21.190 --> 04:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
as an impediment to improving um student
 
04:46:24.788 --> 04:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
outcomes or uh you know limiting um the
 
04:46:26.350 --> 04:46:26.360 align:start position:0%
ability of districts to put into place
 
04:46:30.150 --> 04:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
new programs um however um our concern
 
04:46:31.910 --> 04:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
um with the bill and our primary
 
04:46:33.830 --> 04:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
opposition um and I'll walk through some
 
04:46:35.670 --> 04:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
of these things I think a lot of the
 
04:46:37.628 --> 04:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
language would need to be to be cleaned
 
04:46:41.470 --> 04:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
up first um if possible um for example
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
I'm on I'm on page one starting at line
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
14 um and 15 about a public school May
 
04:46:49.430 --> 04:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
submit an application to the school
 
04:46:53.548 --> 04:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
board it's not clear um who through in
 
04:46:56.030 --> 04:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
the bill it's not clear who's submitting
 
04:46:58.548 --> 04:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
that to the school board uh is it the
 
04:47:01.788 --> 04:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
principal is it the teachers um and you
 
04:47:04.948 --> 04:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
know also NH HSP certainly takes the
 
04:47:07.230 --> 04:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
position that the the local school board
 
04:47:09.470 --> 04:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
is in charge and responsible of all the
 
04:47:12.190 --> 04:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
schools under its purview so something
 
04:47:14.548 --> 04:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
like this is is being drafted or drawn
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
up um I I I just I'm not sure who it is
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's exactly submitting the
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
application to to the school board um or
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
or the or the Innovation plan you know
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
for example on same page on line 22 it
 
04:47:29.150 --> 04:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
says that the school board ejects or
 
04:47:31.868 --> 04:47:31.878 align:start position:0%
approves the plan the note to myself is
 
04:47:34.548 --> 04:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
is who files the plan with the local
 
04:47:34.558 --> 04:47:35.548 align:start position:0%
is who files the plan with the local
school

04:47:35.548 --> 04:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:47:39.150 --> 04:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
board um we had um some of the same
 
04:47:41.868 --> 04:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
concerns that were brought up um I
 
04:47:43.750 --> 04:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
forget which representative brought them
 
04:47:47.150 --> 04:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
up about um uh using May instead of
 
04:47:49.590 --> 04:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
shall um certainly the May provides some
 
04:47:51.910 --> 04:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility and now I'm on just I'm
 
04:47:53.830 --> 04:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
sorry to be clear now I'm on page two
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
line five um you know I I I I think that
 
04:48:00.350 --> 04:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
some of the the the bullet points or the
 
04:48:01.830 --> 04:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
paragraphs that follow the May were
 
04:48:04.430 --> 04:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
intended to be suggestions or ideas but
 
04:48:06.750 --> 04:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
not necessarily all
 
04:48:06.760 --> 04:48:08.270 align:start position:0%
not necessarily all
inclusive

04:48:08.270 --> 04:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
04:48:12.470 --> 04:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
um uh the the other concern nhba has on
 
04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
page two line 12 this is paragraph C
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
that the plan has to include a listing
 
04:48:20.350 --> 04:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
of uh Department of Education
 
04:48:22.270 --> 04:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
administrative rules from which the
 
04:48:23.990 --> 04:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
school district or the the Innovative
 
04:48:26.830 --> 04:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
school is Seeking a waiver um as as
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli alluded to the
 
04:48:31.708 --> 04:48:31.718 align:start position:0%
the the number of administrative rules
 
04:48:34.190 --> 04:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
is is mindbending you know 20 plus P
 
04:48:37.470 --> 04:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's just of a a table of contents uh
 
04:48:39.150 --> 04:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
however we think that that provision
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
should probably be narrowed a little bit
 
04:48:43.948 --> 04:48:43.958 align:start position:0%
rather than being a rather than allowing
 
04:48:45.868 --> 04:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
such a school or such a plan to seek a
 
04:48:48.270 --> 04:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
waiver of of potentially all the rules
 
04:48:49.948 --> 04:48:49.958 align:start position:0%
and not saying that would happen the
 
04:48:51.990 --> 04:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
language of the bill just says a listing
 
04:48:53.948 --> 04:48:53.958 align:start position:0%
of any doe rules I think that should
 
04:48:55.670 --> 04:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
probably be narrow to see exactly what
 
04:48:57.670 --> 04:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
we're speaking about is it the minimum
 
04:49:01.230 --> 04:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
standards under 306 is it um some of the
 
04:49:03.030 --> 04:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
health standards I believe that's rule
 
04:49:03.040 --> 04:49:04.510 align:start position:0%
health standards I believe that's rule
311

04:49:04.510 --> 04:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
311
 
04:49:06.190 --> 04:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
um but some of the other department of
 
04:49:08.230 --> 04:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
education rules such as
 
04:49:10.548 --> 04:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
ed400 um which is the approval of school
 
04:49:12.910 --> 04:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
buildings those are those are based on
 
04:49:15.070 --> 04:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
fire codes for my understanding and
 
04:49:17.150 --> 04:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
building codes so it would you know I
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
don't um you know I I don't think it
 
04:49:20.990 --> 04:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
would be prudent to necessarily be able
 
04:49:24.788 --> 04:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
to wave those certainly the um doe 1100
 
04:49:28.590 --> 04:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
rules are are special education rules um
 
04:49:30.548 --> 04:49:30.558 align:start position:0%
you know we'd want to be hesitant about
 
04:49:32.590 --> 04:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
how if at all those might be able to be
 
04:49:35.628 --> 04:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
waved by the department of educ
 
04:49:39.150 --> 04:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
um moving on on page two um paragraph H
 
04:49:42.030 --> 04:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
about the collective bargaining nhba did
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
not interpret this as meaning that the
 
04:49:47.590 --> 04:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
department would have authority to to
 
04:49:49.230 --> 04:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
wave provisions of a collective
 
04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement as nhba read that
 
04:49:54.990 --> 04:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
provision um it's just a notification or
 
04:49:57.430 --> 04:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
an indication within the plan that
 
04:49:58.990 --> 04:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
certain that the collective bargaining
 
04:50:01.070 --> 04:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
agreement may need to be modified in
 
04:50:02.750 --> 04:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
order to modify that it's going to take
 
04:50:05.390 --> 04:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
both parties to to collectively bargain
 
04:50:07.628 --> 04:50:07.638 align:start position:0%
that and and and reach some sort of
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
mutual agreement before the the CBA
 
04:50:11.868 --> 04:50:11.878 align:start position:0%
could be modified that that was NHS
 
04:50:14.590 --> 04:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
sba's take on it
 
04:50:19.750 --> 04:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
anyway um continuing on um page three
 
04:50:24.150 --> 04:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
looks generally fine um I'm on page four
 
04:50:29.070 --> 04:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
now this is lines 13 through about 16 um
 
04:50:30.548 --> 04:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
where they're talking about the State
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
Board shall either approve or reject the
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
Innovation plan using reasonable
 
04:50:38.670 --> 04:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
discretion um I think we need a higher
 
04:50:40.230 --> 04:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
standard there than reasonable
 
04:50:42.548 --> 04:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
discretion um I I don't have any
 
04:50:45.070 --> 04:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
alternative language right now but it
 
04:50:47.070 --> 04:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
seems that if we're talking about an
 
04:50:52.110 --> 04:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
application to wave certain um rules um
 
04:50:53.510 --> 04:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education
 
04:50:54.990 --> 04:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
especially if they related to things
 
04:50:57.030 --> 04:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
like the minimum standards I think we
 
04:50:59.110 --> 04:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
should have a higher standard for what
 
04:51:01.548 --> 04:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
the um what the
 
04:51:04.190 --> 04:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
um what the decision of the state board
 
04:51:07.548 --> 04:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
would be based off of
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
um again especially if it related to to
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
ad adequacy or or School approval um
 
04:51:16.628 --> 04:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
page four I'm on um line 24 this is
 
04:51:18.430 --> 04:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph three it says no waiver shall
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
be granted from um any requirement of
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
the federal uh Essa every student
 
04:51:27.948 --> 04:51:27.958 align:start position:0%
succeeds act um I think our our our
 
04:51:29.628 --> 04:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
preference would be that no waiver shall
 
04:51:31.990 --> 04:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
be granted from any federal requirements
 
04:51:33.070 --> 04:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't think you could do that
 
04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
anyway that a Department of the New
 
04:51:36.430 --> 04:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education can't
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
simply wave a local school district's
 
04:51:40.470 --> 04:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
obligation to follow a federal
 
04:51:42.110 --> 04:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
requirement but just to be a little bit
 
04:51:42.120 --> 04:51:42.830 align:start position:0%
requirement but just to be a little bit
more

04:51:42.830 --> 04:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:51:44.948 --> 04:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing um you know that would
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that um Provisions under special
 
04:51:49.868 --> 04:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
education and idea law would would be
 
04:51:52.708 --> 04:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
noted as being protected under the
 
04:51:56.628 --> 04:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
bill um and I representative cordelli I
 
04:51:58.548 --> 04:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
think you you did speak to this a little
 
04:52:00.510 --> 04:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
bit and I'm on now I'm still on page
 
04:52:04.670 --> 04:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
four um lines 35 and 36
 
04:52:07.230 --> 04:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
um and it says if the local school board
 
04:52:10.628 --> 04:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
finds that academic performance um uh
 
04:52:12.110 --> 04:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
students enrolled in The Innovation plan
 
04:52:14.830 --> 04:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
is not improving at a sufficient rate um
 
04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
and you I believe representative Cordo
 
04:52:17.990 --> 04:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
you talked about that based on sort of
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
being the goals that's that are
 
04:52:22.110 --> 04:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
initially implemented um you know I
 
04:52:23.910 --> 04:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
think that may make sense but again
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's going to have to be some sort of
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
metrics if you will um and more so not
 
04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
so much at the local Schoolboard level
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
but if we turn to page five I'm on line
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
11 then this is paragraph 4 the State
 
04:52:38.030 --> 04:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
Board May revoke the innovate The
 
04:52:40.390 --> 04:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
Innovation status at any time with
 
04:52:41.868 --> 04:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
notification of the local Schoolboard
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
and Department um I think that we would
 
04:52:47.110 --> 04:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
have to put some criteria in the statute
 
04:52:49.030 --> 04:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
as to what criteria the State Board is
 
04:52:52.150 --> 04:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
going to be using um if and when it were
 
04:52:55.430 --> 04:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
to revoke um uh in invitation status and
 
04:52:57.390 --> 04:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
especially you know if it's been
 
04:52:59.868 --> 04:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
approved through a process with some
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
sort of rigor and quality it seems to
 
04:53:04.110 --> 04:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
make sense that it could be revoked or
 
04:53:07.750 --> 04:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawn based on a similar um um
 
04:53:11.030 --> 04:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
standard for lack of a better phrase um
 
04:53:13.390 --> 04:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
so the relative to the bill itself there
 
04:53:16.350 --> 04:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
are those were sort of nhs's concerns
 
04:53:19.310 --> 04:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
with it um you know uh also as
 
04:53:20.708 --> 04:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
representa of Cordo you mentioned I
 
04:53:22.868 --> 04:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
believe there were 14 states that that
 
04:53:25.628 --> 04:53:25.638 align:start position:0%
have these um uh have these the
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
legislation that allows for the
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
Innovative schools um I've done a little
 
04:53:31.708 --> 04:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
bit of research on on those States um
 
04:53:35.350 --> 04:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
not a lot yet but um given sort of the
 
04:53:37.788 --> 04:53:37.798 align:start position:0%
the the widespread implication of this
 
04:53:41.510 --> 04:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill we would think that um um you know
 
04:53:43.830 --> 04:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
this committee um and I I apologize I
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
know there was some discussion earlier
 
04:53:46.670 --> 04:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
about whether or not the legislature was
 
04:53:48.430 --> 04:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
going to entertain committees or
 
04:53:50.350 --> 04:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
commissions over the summer and the fall
 
04:53:53.788 --> 04:53:53.798 align:start position:0%
and um regardless of that aspect um you
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
know it might be helpful for the
 
04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
committee to get some more information
 
04:54:00.350 --> 04:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
about the other 13 or 14 states that
 
04:54:02.708 --> 04:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
have had this in place and sort of what
 
04:54:05.230 --> 04:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
the outcomes are how their state board
 
04:54:07.510 --> 04:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
of education if any has developed rules
 
04:54:10.750 --> 04:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
relative to this um and whether or not
 
04:54:12.030 --> 04:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
um you know these are leading to The
 
04:54:14.670 --> 04:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
Innovation that that we that we would
 
04:54:17.350 --> 04:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
hope for um and that we do have in our
 
04:54:21.910 --> 04:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
Public Schools as well too um so last um
 
04:54:24.270 --> 04:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
if you'll bear with me for one minute um
 
04:54:25.750 --> 04:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli we certainly
 
04:54:28.350 --> 04:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the the the idea of
 
04:54:29.788 --> 04:54:29.798 align:start position:0%
Trying to minimize some of the
 
04:54:31.670 --> 04:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden as I think I led my
 
04:54:34.350 --> 04:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
comments off with that I guess NH sba's
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
last comment would be that if we feel we
 
04:54:39.350 --> 04:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I shouldn't include myself in
 
04:54:43.110 --> 04:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
that if you feel that there is um uh too
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
much regulation at the Department of
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
Education and some of these regulatory
 
04:54:50.788 --> 04:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
burdens are are impeding um uh things
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
that local school districts might want
 
04:54:54.910 --> 04:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
to to try that are that are different or
 
04:54:57.590 --> 04:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
new um the legislature has the authority
 
04:55:00.628 --> 04:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
to pass statutes that either eliminate
 
04:55:03.750 --> 04:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
or add to regulations so um if there's
 
04:55:05.430 --> 04:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
too many regulations I think that's in
 
04:55:07.390 --> 04:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
your hands and and and while I
 
04:55:09.070 --> 04:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
understand this bill seeks to do this in
 
04:55:11.708 --> 04:55:11.718 align:start position:0%
a limited fashion perhaps a a wider
 
04:55:14.868 --> 04:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
review of of what doe regulations that
 
04:55:16.868 --> 04:55:16.878 align:start position:0%
may be impeding school districts would
 
04:55:19.868 --> 04:55:19.878 align:start position:0%
would be would be prudent as well too um
 
04:55:22.750 --> 04:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
so uh with that uh those are on hba's uh
 
04:55:26.030 --> 04:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
comments um I think the concept of of of
 
04:55:27.990 --> 04:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
relaxing some regulations is a great
 
04:55:30.390 --> 04:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
idea but the bill is written um we have
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
some some concerns with and with that
 
04:55:33.948 --> 04:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions from
 
04:55:33.958 --> 04:55:34.628 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions from
the

04:55:34.628 --> 04:55:34.638 align:start position:0%

04:55:37.030 --> 04:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much uh Barrett
 
04:55:39.150 --> 04:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that input uh are there
 
04:55:41.070 --> 04:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
any questions of the New Hampshire
 
04:55:44.548 --> 04:55:44.558 align:start position:0%

04:55:49.750 --> 04:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
Erica you got it yes thank you Mr
 
04:55:52.470 --> 04:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
repres representative Erica Leon from
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
der Rockingham 6 uh I see oversight from
 
04:55:58.190 --> 04:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
four distinct entities the schools
 
04:56:00.590 --> 04:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
School Board Department of Education and
 
04:56:02.990 --> 04:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education and all of
 
04:56:04.708 --> 04:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
these are Tas with the regulatory
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
requirements that might be waved under
 
04:56:09.548 --> 04:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
this bill these four regulatory arms are
 
04:56:11.628 --> 04:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
vested in protecting the interest of and
 
04:56:13.788 --> 04:56:13.798 align:start position:0%
outcomes in education in New Hampshire
 
04:56:16.310 --> 04:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
and as written this bill allows for
 
04:56:19.030 --> 04:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
innov for schools to test
 
04:56:23.230 --> 04:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
out test out ways that perhaps we may
 
04:56:25.230 --> 04:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
want to change the laws in the future
 
04:56:27.788 --> 04:56:27.798 align:start position:0%
but without an opportunity to see if in
 
04:56:31.590 --> 04:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
one microcosm this is beneficial or not
 
04:56:33.990 --> 04:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
this it would be hard to put for some of
 
04:56:36.110 --> 04:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
those new new regulations and new laws
 
04:56:39.628 --> 04:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
or loosen them um there's a point of a
 
04:56:42.990 --> 04:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
viw at 2 years so I I don't see how
 
04:56:46.110 --> 04:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
allowing for different regulatory groups
 
04:56:48.150 --> 04:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
to have checks and balances on these is
 
04:56:51.270 --> 04:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
such a threat to the to the education of
 
04:56:51.280 --> 04:56:53.708 align:start position:0%
such a threat to the to the education of
our

04:56:53.708 --> 04:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:56.110 --> 04:56:56.120 align:start position:0%
children question oh I'm sorry yeah
 
04:56:57.510 --> 04:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
everything has to be an inform of
 
04:56:59.910 --> 04:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
question so okay I was writing it as qu
 
04:57:01.868 --> 04:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
I was trying to put it as questions and
 
04:57:03.868 --> 04:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
in my my experience in the past it
 
04:57:06.350 --> 04:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't that I'm sorry so I guess what
 
04:57:10.270 --> 04:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to ask you uh Mr Christina is
 
04:57:13.548 --> 04:57:13.558 align:start position:0%
if if you don't if you believe that
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
these these four levels of regul uh
 
04:57:18.990 --> 04:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory uh the schools school boards
 
04:57:20.510 --> 04:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and State Board
 
04:57:22.868 --> 04:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
of Education aren't interested in
 
04:57:25.030 --> 04:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
keeping the majority of these
 
04:57:25.040 --> 04:57:26.830 align:start position:0%
keeping the majority of these
regulations

04:57:26.830 --> 04:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
04:57:28.990 --> 04:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
intact thank you for the question
 
04:57:32.548 --> 04:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
representative um I I I had a little bit
 
04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
of a hard time hearing you so I
 
04:57:36.310 --> 04:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
apologize the clarification was are the
 
04:57:40.070 --> 04:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
four levels of review sufficient to and
 
04:57:43.070 --> 04:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
I missed the last part of that um to to
 
04:57:45.590 --> 04:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
keep the interests of of keeping
 
04:57:49.150 --> 04:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
regulations largely intact while while
 
04:57:51.030 --> 04:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
trying while trying to provide some
 
04:57:54.390 --> 04:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
flexibility to explore Alternatives sure
 
04:57:56.470 --> 04:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question um
 
04:58:00.868 --> 04:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
representative um I nhp's um concerns
 
04:58:02.390 --> 04:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
with the bill were not necessarily
 
04:58:03.788 --> 04:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
related to
 
04:58:05.390 --> 04:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
the the three or four levels of
 
04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
safeguards it's local school board the
 
04:58:09.270 --> 04:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
department the State Board of Education
 
04:58:11.548 --> 04:58:11.558 align:start position:0%
our primary concerns were with sort of
 
04:58:12.830 --> 04:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
how the bill was written some of the
 
04:58:14.230 --> 04:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
language in the bill that I think would
 
04:58:16.430 --> 04:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
need to be cleared up and to your point
 
04:58:19.030 --> 04:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
about um you know sort of the two-year
 
04:58:20.830 --> 04:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
review or the two-year cycle that these
 
04:58:22.470 --> 04:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
would be going through to have their
 
04:58:24.628 --> 04:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
Innovative Innovation School status
 
04:58:27.310 --> 04:58:27.320 align:start position:0%
renewed by the State Board of Education
 
04:58:30.670 --> 04:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
um you know there's certainly you
 
04:58:33.628 --> 04:58:33.638 align:start position:0%
know there's certainly
 
04:58:35.788 --> 04:58:35.798 align:start position:0%
some precedent in the state for running
 
04:58:38.868 --> 04:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
know pilot projects if you will um
 
04:58:40.868 --> 04:58:40.878 align:start position:0%
before we just sort of opened up a a
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
full legislative um change without
 
04:58:46.510 --> 04:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily understanding what the
 
04:58:48.510 --> 04:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
outcomes might be which is why I
 
04:58:50.270 --> 04:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
suggested there might be you might be
 
04:58:52.788 --> 04:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
want to might make sense to establish a
 
04:58:54.830 --> 04:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
a committee of some sort over the summer
 
04:58:56.708 --> 04:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
and the fall to look at what the
 
04:58:59.390 --> 04:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
educational outcomes um in Colorado but
 
04:59:00.868 --> 04:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
I believe Colorado is the first state
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
and has been doing this for about 10 or
 
04:59:06.190 --> 04:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
11 years or so um so you know maybe look
 
04:59:08.110 --> 04:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
at the states that have been doing this
 
04:59:11.830 --> 04:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
for five 6 10 years and see how their
 
04:59:13.390 --> 04:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
local school districts are fairing
 
04:59:13.400 --> 04:59:14.310 align:start position:0%
local school districts are fairing
before

04:59:14.310 --> 04:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:59:17.030 --> 04:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
nhba um you know or excuse me before the
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire were to were to
 
04:59:22.510 --> 04:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
move forward with something like
 
04:59:27.750 --> 04:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
this thank you attorney Christina um uh
 
04:59:29.868 --> 04:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
 
04:59:32.030 --> 04:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
04:59:32.040 --> 04:59:34.510 align:start position:0%

please yes thank you first I want to
 
05:00:49.510 --> 05:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you guys for making this available
 
05:00:52.590 --> 05:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
to parents to listen in so I'm grateful
 
05:00:55.230 --> 05:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
for that I have a couple of thoughts
 
05:00:58.110 --> 05:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to pass by um these
 
05:01:00.350 --> 05:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
Innovative schools seem to be moving
 
05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
away from the regular public school I
 
05:01:06.750 --> 05:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
see them more as
 
05:01:09.470 --> 05:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
um collecting bigger data on our
 
05:01:12.070 --> 05:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
students they're going to be globally
 
05:01:16.510 --> 05:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
connected which means uh sort of a no
 
05:01:19.590 --> 05:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
borders look uh but more than anything
 
05:01:21.030 --> 05:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
there's going to be larger data
 
05:01:23.110 --> 05:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
collection on our students not only
 
05:01:26.590 --> 05:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning but uh so
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
they're going to be so who who's who
 
05:01:31.430 --> 05:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
looks at that who determines uh the
 
05:01:33.470 --> 05:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
behavior of these students
 
05:01:36.110 --> 05:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
and so you're going to be tracking them
 
05:01:39.070 --> 05:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure from beginning to end all
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
the way through into the business world
 
05:01:46.430 --> 05:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
so I see these Innovative schools um as
 
05:01:48.590 --> 05:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
being a replacement for the older way of
 
05:01:51.150 --> 05:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
doing things and then I want to look at
 
05:01:53.110 --> 05:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
who's making the money off of this I
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
would say uh one of those companies um
 
05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
would be bright bites uh so that
 
05:02:02.948 --> 05:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
concerns me as a parent are we going to
 
05:02:05.270 --> 05:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
have access to these records of our
 
05:02:07.708 --> 05:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
children and what happens to all this
 
05:02:10.948 --> 05:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
big data and who ends up with it those
 
05:02:12.910 --> 05:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
are my questions where does this big
 
05:02:15.510 --> 05:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
data end up with our children and who
 
05:02:17.590 --> 05:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
determines who's qualified to go on to
 
05:02:20.788 --> 05:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
college and who isn't based on their
 
05:02:24.548 --> 05:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
behavior and um you know this this is
 
05:02:27.070 --> 05:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
huge you're really taking a lot into
 
05:02:30.190 --> 05:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
your hands with our children and I see
 
05:02:33.390 --> 05:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
it moving away from um
 
05:02:36.230 --> 05:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
just basic good education I'm not
 
05:02:38.030 --> 05:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
against technology but I'm against
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
collecting this big data so I want to
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
know who hands that data ends up with
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
who's making money off of it and how
 
05:02:49.110 --> 05:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
does that affect our children thank you
 
05:02:51.230 --> 05:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Miss Thomas uh are
 
05:02:54.150 --> 05:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
there any questions that you would for
 
05:02:57.708 --> 05:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
her was she going no I can bring it back
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee Rick Rick if I if I may add I
 
05:03:06.430 --> 05:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
think as we get testimony from the
 
05:03:08.948 --> 05:03:08.958 align:start position:0%
public uh for the record would it be
 
05:03:10.750 --> 05:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
good for them to State their name and
 
05:03:12.390 --> 05:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
the community with which they're coming
 
05:03:15.670 --> 05:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
from yeah we can do that now thank you
 
05:03:18.750 --> 05:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh are I don't see
 
05:03:20.788 --> 05:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
anybody with their hands up and she's

forms here which I received that are in
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill I haven't
 
05:03:45.190 --> 05:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
bothered to count them but one of these
 
05:03:45.200 --> 05:03:47.548 align:start position:0%

sheets

05:03:47.548 --> 05:03:47.558 align:start position:0%
sheets

um oh they they look like this and I got
 
05:03:54.510 --> 05:03:54.520 align:start position:0%

05:03:59.708 --> 05:03:59.718 align:start position:0%
so we had two more to speak from the
 
05:04:02.830 --> 05:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
attendees okay okay we have two more on

05:04:08.548 --> 05:04:08.558 align:start position:0%

05:04:21.200 --> 05:04:23.788 align:start position:0%
 
Hobson

05:04:23.788 --> 05:04:23.798 align:start position:0%
Hobson
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
may it
 
05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:31.558 --> 05:04:34.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:04:34.190 --> 05:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:04:37.470 --> 05:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
Sor that's Mr okay we have Jim Dodges
 
05:04:39.590 --> 05:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
from nashwa that's the mayor would like
 
05:04:42.548 --> 05:04:42.558 align:start position:0%
to speak on this one uh
 
05:04:46.390 --> 05:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
welcome yes uh thank you Mr chair and I
 
05:04:48.270 --> 05:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
know you're busy so I'll just take a
 
05:04:51.590 --> 05:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
minute I want to speak in opposition to
 
05:04:55.270 --> 05:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
the the bill that you have before you
 
05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
for various reasons but principally
 
05:04:59.910 --> 05:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
because it will reduce the level of
 
05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
funding that is going to our public
 
05:05:06.510 --> 05:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
schools at a time when we need more
 
05:05:08.430 --> 05:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
money not less I mean we've been we're
 
05:05:11.190 --> 05:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
almost one year into a pandemic now we
 
05:05:13.070 --> 05:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
know that kids are suffer suffering a
 
05:05:15.708 --> 05:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
learning loss in our public schools and
 
05:05:17.788 --> 05:05:17.798 align:start position:0%
that Gap will have to be made up and to
 
05:05:17.798 --> 05:05:19.230 align:start position:0%
that Gap will have to be made up and to
do

05:05:19.230 --> 05:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:05:21.750 --> 05:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
that it will be more difficult to do
 
05:05:24.670 --> 05:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
that if funds are cut and the mechanism
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
of funding The Innovation school would
 
05:05:30.628 --> 05:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
be to uh take take money away from the
 
05:05:33.430 --> 05:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
public school system now I've often
 
05:05:35.590 --> 05:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
heard the argument that well if the
 
05:05:35.600 --> 05:05:37.948 align:start position:0%
heard the argument that well if the
enrollment

05:05:37.948 --> 05:05:37.958 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
05:05:41.110 --> 05:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
declines you save money but that is not
 
05:05:43.948 --> 05:05:43.958 align:start position:0%
really true if you think about
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
it I'm going to use Nash as an example
 
05:05:48.910 --> 05:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
not because it's more important than any
 
05:05:52.230 --> 05:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
other community but because I understand
 
05:05:55.548 --> 05:05:55.558 align:start position:0%
you know the facts the
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
best the let's say we have about 350
 
05:06:01.070 --> 05:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
classrooms and let's say we started an
 
05:06:03.750 --> 05:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
innovation School
 
05:06:08.230 --> 05:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
and 100 Kids joined now that's in 12
 
05:06:13.270 --> 05:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
grades across 17 schools 350 classrooms
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
so maybe 100 classrooms see a decline of
 
05:06:21.030 --> 05:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
one kid so in you know in the fourth
 
05:06:23.030 --> 05:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
grade at ammer Street Elementary School
 
05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
there aren't 21 kids now they're
 
05:06:25.520 --> 05:06:27.190 align:start position:0%
there aren't 21 kids now they're
20

05:06:27.190 --> 05:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
20
 
05:06:29.910 --> 05:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't decrease costs at all
 
05:06:32.510 --> 05:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
but it does reduce Revenue to the the
 
05:06:34.788 --> 05:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
school district because money school aid
 
05:06:38.750 --> 05:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
is reduced and and directed towards the
 
05:06:38.760 --> 05:06:40.548 align:start position:0%
is reduced and and directed towards the
Innovation

05:06:40.548 --> 05:06:40.558 align:start position:0%
Innovation
 
05:06:43.590 --> 05:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
school one issue that you know problem
 
05:06:45.510 --> 05:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
that has resulted from the charter
 
05:06:47.110 --> 05:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
schools is
 
05:06:50.628 --> 05:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
that the it they've they've caused a
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
loss in Revenue at a time when we can't
 
05:06:57.390 --> 05:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
afford a loss in Revenue so in in the
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
interest of educational quality I and
 
05:07:03.270 --> 05:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
and uh sustaining the public schools in
 
05:07:05.230 --> 05:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which are very obviously
 
05:07:07.868 --> 05:07:07.878 align:start position:0%
very important I would ask that you
 
05:07:09.708 --> 05:07:09.718 align:start position:0%
either defeat the bill or come up with
 
05:07:13.948 --> 05:07:13.958 align:start position:0%
the money to uh replace any lost Revenue
 
05:07:18.110 --> 05:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
that would go to that would that uh uh
 
05:07:20.310 --> 05:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
school districts local school districts
 
05:07:22.390 --> 05:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
would suffer as a result of the
 
05:07:25.270 --> 05:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
establishment of a Innovation school and
 
05:07:28.110 --> 05:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
the transfer of students to that school
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
I think that gives you know a summary of
 
05:07:33.150 --> 05:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
my thoughts I don't want to take up too
 
05:07:35.548 --> 05:07:35.558 align:start position:0%
much time I could do more but but uh
 
05:07:37.628 --> 05:07:37.638 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that and take questions
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Mayor um are
 
05:07:40.080 --> 05:07:42.548 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Mayor um are
there

05:07:42.548 --> 05:07:42.558 align:start position:0%

questions I see no hands thank you very
 
05:07:47.310 --> 05:07:47.320 align:start position:0%

05:07:49.230 --> 05:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
for having me hold it you got you got a
 
05:07:52.590 --> 05:07:52.600 align:start position:0%
question from representative Moffet
 
05:07:54.590 --> 05:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:07:58.150 --> 05:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
mayor uh your question seems to imply
 
05:08:01.070 --> 05:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
that an innovation school would be a new
 
05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
different School my understanding is
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
that an innovation school would be the
 
05:08:08.230 --> 05:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
same school that just uh gets a break
 
05:08:10.910 --> 05:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
from having to follow some of the rules
 
05:08:14.310 --> 05:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh is that not your understanding uh
 
05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
well my understanding is that there
 
05:08:17.868 --> 05:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
would be a separate School so-called
 
05:08:21.110 --> 05:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
Innovation school like and kids would uh
 
05:08:24.430 --> 05:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
go there just like they do in like for
 
05:08:25.910 --> 05:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
example a charter
 
05:08:29.350 --> 05:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
school uh again Charter Schools do offer
 
05:08:31.990 --> 05:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
offer a you know a good route for some
 
05:08:33.910 --> 05:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
kids kids but there's no question that
 
05:08:37.270 --> 05:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
that they they C they result in a loss
 
05:08:40.590 --> 05:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
of Revenue and therefore low a low lower
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
level of service at lower level of
 
05:08:46.830 --> 05:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:48.910 --> 05:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
schools follow
 
05:08:51.708 --> 05:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
up I'd like to ask you follow up to the
 
05:08:54.548 --> 05:08:54.558 align:start position:0%
sponsor if they could well no sponsor
 
05:08:57.190 --> 05:08:57.200 align:start position:0%

Hawkins from Nea New Hampshire uh we

represent over
 
05:09:54.548 --> 05:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
177,000 uh Educators across the state in
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining and
 
05:09:59.190 --> 05:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
um so uh thank you thank you for taking
 
05:10:01.628 --> 05:10:01.638 align:start position:0%
my uh testimony I'll submit some written
 
05:10:03.750 --> 05:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
testimon that U Megan Tuttle our
 
05:10:06.430 --> 05:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
president had uh to you but I'll just
 
05:10:07.990 --> 05:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
sum up a couple points because I know
 
05:10:11.470 --> 05:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
you're uh running short on time um the
 
05:10:14.670 --> 05:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
first was uh regarding the involvement
 
05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
of Educators in this uh bill um while
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
there are several Provisions in it that
 
05:10:21.708 --> 05:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
uh call
 
05:10:26.350 --> 05:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
for um public hearings um we think that
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
really in the spirit of developing an
 
05:10:33.430 --> 05:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
innovation plan um uh just like in the
 
05:10:35.788 --> 05:10:35.798 align:start position:0%
uh some of the tenants of Essa
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um really need to be
 
05:10:40.350 --> 05:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
consulted and meaningfully participate
 
05:10:42.750 --> 05:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
in these types of improvements and so we
 
05:10:44.350 --> 05:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
don't see anywhere in this bill where
 
05:10:46.788 --> 05:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
this uh specifically includes Educators
 
05:10:49.350 --> 05:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
in that um so that's some that that is
 
05:10:53.230 --> 05:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
an issue uh that that uh we have the
 
05:10:56.070 --> 05:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
second has come up a few times it's the
 
05:10:58.948 --> 05:10:58.958 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining issue and um you
 
05:11:01.510 --> 05:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
know there are uh several lines in this
 
05:11:01.520 --> 05:11:02.590 align:start position:0%
know there are uh several lines in this
bill

05:11:02.590 --> 05:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:11:05.830 --> 05:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh including page two line 8 um and Page
 
05:11:10.548 --> 05:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
Three line 24 where there's a series of
 
05:11:14.070 --> 05:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh specific aspects around terms and
 
05:11:17.830 --> 05:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
conditions of employment um that may be
 
05:11:21.628 --> 05:11:21.638 align:start position:0%
submitted um to the state board for
 
05:11:24.990 --> 05:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
approval uh we still have a concern
 
05:11:27.390 --> 05:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
about that I know there's been a couple
 
05:11:31.310 --> 05:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
of comments saying that um uh it's not
 
05:11:35.548 --> 05:11:35.558 align:start position:0%
but on the uh when you get to the the
 
05:11:38.030 --> 05:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
point in the bill where it talks about
 
05:11:43.190 --> 05:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
approval or uh denial of the local uh
 
05:11:46.030 --> 05:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
school board or the local public schools
 
05:11:51.230 --> 05:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
plan it says that um it says that the
 
05:11:53.750 --> 05:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
state board can approve or or deny that
 
05:11:57.548 --> 05:11:57.558 align:start position:0%
plan and so what does that mean if a a a
 
05:12:00.430 --> 05:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
school does choose to put in something
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh for example that that's up already
 
05:12:05.628 --> 05:12:05.638 align:start position:0%
where it says a description of of any
 
05:12:07.590 --> 05:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
uhu excuse me of any provision of
 
05:12:09.270 --> 05:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
collective bar bargaining agreement in
 
05:12:11.310 --> 05:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
effect for personnel that would need to
 
05:12:15.670 --> 05:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
be waved or modified so um there are
 
05:12:17.708 --> 05:12:17.718 align:start position:0%
there were the series of ma earlier in
 
05:12:20.230 --> 05:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
the bill bill but at the end of it it it
 
05:12:23.430 --> 05:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
does say a shall approve or deny and so
 
05:12:27.030 --> 05:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
what does that mean for
 
05:12:30.548 --> 05:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
um uh for Provisions such as that and
 
05:12:33.990 --> 05:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
again some of which are uh Provisions
 
05:12:36.830 --> 05:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
that specifically relate to uh
 
05:12:38.430 --> 05:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
negotiating terms and conditions of
 
05:12:41.150 --> 05:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
employment um we have a few other areas
 
05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
of of concern around uh you know that
 
05:12:46.830 --> 05:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
have been mentioned uh as well already
 
05:12:50.590 --> 05:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
around special education um services for
 
05:12:52.390 --> 05:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
English as a second language and so
 
05:12:54.350 --> 05:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
forth but that's included in our our
 
05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony so I I'll leave it
 
05:12:58.548 --> 05:12:58.558 align:start position:0%
there I'll I'll just I'll emphasize
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
those two points about the educator
 
05:13:01.910 --> 05:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
input and the collective bargaining
 
05:13:04.310 --> 05:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
issue I'm happy to take any questions
 
05:13:06.150 --> 05:13:06.160 align:start position:0%

questions not seeing any uh thank you

05:13:15.910 --> 05:13:15.920 align:start position:0%

05:13:22.670 --> 05:13:22.680 align:start position:0%

day what we've done is HB 194 and 323
 
05:20:13.788 --> 05:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
are dealing with the same topic from but
 
05:20:17.390 --> 05:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
they're both different so I'm G to have
 
05:20:19.230 --> 05:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of
 
05:20:22.030 --> 05:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
194 that is representative
 
05:20:24.990 --> 05:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
cordelli speak and present on that
 
05:20:28.830 --> 05:20:28.840 align:start position:0%

come he'll be then sitting here as chair
 
05:20:38.190 --> 05:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
and I'll introduce uh
 
05:20:41.350 --> 05:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
323 then if the public has questions on
 
05:20:43.788 --> 05:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
either one they they can ask the
 
05:20:45.070 --> 05:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
questions of
 
05:20:48.070 --> 05:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
us uh see that's not going to work
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
either because you
 
05:20:55.470 --> 05:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:58.310 --> 05:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
first okay so I'm opening up the hearing
 
05:21:01.750 --> 05:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
right now on hb1 194
 
05:21:03.750 --> 05:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh this is a bill relative to the
 
05:21:05.590 --> 05:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
release of student assessment
 
05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
information and
 
05:21:09.990 --> 05:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
data represent
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you Mr
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
chairman uh for the record Glen cordelli
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
representing tuen B molon bur and
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:23.628 --> 05:21:23.638 align:start position:0%
Region this has been a topic of
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
discussion um for the past couple of
 
05:21:33.270 --> 05:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
years and the main goal is to to help
 
05:21:37.350 --> 05:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
parents and districts uh helping
 
05:21:39.270 --> 05:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
districts uh
 
05:21:42.548 --> 05:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
involves making sure that information is
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
getting out on a timely basis to parents
 
05:21:51.230 --> 05:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh with the results of State assessments
 
05:21:52.548 --> 05:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
uh on their
 
05:21:56.190 --> 05:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
children uh if that does not happen if
 
05:21:58.868 --> 05:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
the results are not provided on a timely
 
05:22:02.788 --> 05:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
basis districts are are in uh danger of
 
05:22:06.910 --> 05:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
losing uh federal funds according to the
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh Essa every student succeeds Act and
 
05:22:12.590 --> 05:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:22:16.350 --> 05:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
idea uh so we want to prevent that uh
 
05:22:18.788 --> 05:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
but there are districts we know and have
 
05:22:22.470 --> 05:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
heard testimony about um that are not uh
 
05:22:25.390 --> 05:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
getting information time out on a timely
 
05:22:28.150 --> 05:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
basis and um on some occasions they're
 
05:22:30.110 --> 05:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
not getting the information to parents
 
05:22:31.990 --> 05:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
at all
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
uh so there has been um legislation
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
previously to try and address that and
 
05:22:42.310 --> 05:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
we try and uh take it a step uh further
 
05:22:42.320 --> 05:22:44.628 align:start position:0%
we try and uh take it a step uh further
here

05:22:44.628 --> 05:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:22:49.190 --> 05:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
um our Statewide testing
 
05:22:51.430 --> 05:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
agency has in their
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
contract that they can and will send out
 
05:22:58.750 --> 05:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
the assessment data directly to parents
 
05:23:01.470 --> 05:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
themselves they do that in
 
05:23:03.788 --> 05:23:03.798 align:start position:0%
approximately a dozen other states
 
05:23:07.510 --> 05:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
already uh I think that that would be a
 
05:23:11.270 --> 05:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
a time saer uh both for the department
 
05:23:14.628 --> 05:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
and for districts uh and ensuring that
 
05:23:16.830 --> 05:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
parents get that information on a timely
 
05:23:19.830 --> 05:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
basis as well as possibly more complete
 
05:23:21.750 --> 05:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
information um including more
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
information uh related to student growth
 
05:23:27.190 --> 05:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
which is part of the every student
 
05:23:27.200 --> 05:23:28.910 align:start position:0%
which is part of the every student
succeeds

05:23:28.910 --> 05:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
succeeds
 
05:23:33.150 --> 05:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
act so that's what we try and address in
 
05:23:37.788 --> 05:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
194 uh especially in the first um first
 
05:23:37.798 --> 05:23:39.708 align:start position:0%
194 uh especially in the first um first
paragraph

05:23:39.708 --> 05:23:39.718 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
05:23:44.110 --> 05:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that also um on lines 12
 
05:23:47.190 --> 05:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
and 13 um I think in the last
 
05:23:50.590 --> 05:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed um there was
 
05:23:51.948 --> 05:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
maybe uh
 
05:23:54.350 --> 05:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
some uh maybe some better language that
 
05:23:57.430 --> 05:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
we tried to incorporate here in terms of
 
05:24:00.510 --> 05:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh I think the statutes now say that U
 
05:24:00.520 --> 05:24:01.350 align:start position:0%
uh I think the statutes now say that U
the

05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:24:07.430 --> 05:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
information um uh is kept um for 8 years
 
05:24:09.510 --> 05:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
but there's no definition of when that
 
05:24:09.520 --> 05:24:10.670 align:start position:0%
but there's no definition of when that
clock

05:24:10.670 --> 05:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
clock
 
05:24:14.230 --> 05:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
starts um is it does it start with uh
 
05:24:16.510 --> 05:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
their first state assessment or does it
 
05:24:19.350 --> 05:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
start with your last state assessment so
 
05:24:23.470 --> 05:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
we provide in here the language that um
 
05:24:26.230 --> 05:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
the uh tested agency shall destroy the
 
05:24:29.868 --> 05:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
student data uh when the student has
 
05:24:33.868 --> 05:24:33.878 align:start position:0%
gone through the 8th grade when they are
 
05:24:38.230 --> 05:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
U finished with the Statewide assessment
 
05:24:41.190 --> 05:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh and now in high school they move on
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
to the SAT as the Statewide assessment
 
05:24:46.030 --> 05:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
so there's no reason for the tesed
 
05:24:48.708 --> 05:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
agency to keep the data longer than that
 
05:24:53.070 --> 05:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
so the intent here is that uh the state
 
05:24:55.350 --> 05:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
assessment excuse me the state uh
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
testing Authority um would be able to
 
05:25:01.590 --> 05:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
send out uh the information um I know
 
05:25:04.230 --> 05:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
that the uh Net bill uh takes a little
 
05:25:09.230 --> 05:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
different um uh approach and um I think
 
05:25:10.548 --> 05:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
we have a great
 
05:25:12.628 --> 05:25:12.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity um while we have a
 
05:25:15.628 --> 05:25:15.638 align:start position:0%
concurrent uh hearing uh for the first
 
05:25:18.708 --> 05:25:18.718 align:start position:0%
time uh this year but I think we also
 
05:25:20.750 --> 05:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
have the possibility to merge these two
 
05:25:24.270 --> 05:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
bills um into one and uh accomplish
 
05:25:27.750 --> 05:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
something that everybody can agree on
 
05:25:27.760 --> 05:25:28.868 align:start position:0%
something that everybody can agree on
thank

05:25:28.868 --> 05:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
you are there question questions for
 
05:25:32.910 --> 05:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli representative
 
05:25:37.270 --> 05:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
Miler uh thank you Mr chair there's no
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
question in my mind that the need for
 
05:25:43.788 --> 05:25:43.798 align:start position:0%
parents to receive this data none
 
05:25:45.948 --> 05:25:45.958 align:start position:0%
whatsoever but when we were dealing with
 
05:25:49.070 --> 05:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
this last time representive cordelli we
 
05:25:51.270 --> 05:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
raised the question with what is the
 
05:25:54.310 --> 05:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
incident rate of school districts not
 
05:25:57.990 --> 05:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
providing this information to parents we
 
05:26:00.230 --> 05:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
asked the Department of Education to
 
05:26:03.510 --> 05:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
give us a list of those uh those
 
05:26:06.548 --> 05:26:06.558 align:start position:0%
delinquent school districts and we did
 
05:26:10.390 --> 05:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
not receive any so my question to you is
 
05:26:11.830 --> 05:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
do you have new
 
05:26:14.110 --> 05:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
information that would basically talk
 
05:26:17.110 --> 05:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
about the incident rate of parents not
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:22.910 --> 05:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
fashion thank you for the question I do
 
05:26:25.868 --> 05:26:25.878 align:start position:0%
not have um new information on any
 
05:26:29.110 --> 05:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
specific U incident rate but uh I can
 
05:26:32.670 --> 05:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
see if um we can get that information
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
please do thank you very
 
05:26:39.030 --> 05:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
much further questions of represent
 
05:26:43.310 --> 05:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:45.868 --> 05:26:45.878 align:start position:0%
Mullen thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli um my concern
 
05:26:53.150 --> 05:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative is in uh the second
 
05:26:56.548 --> 05:26:56.558 align:start position:0%
paragraph which begins with 193
 
05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
C12 uh in this paragraph the way I read
 
05:27:03.310 --> 05:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
it the district shall provide student
 
05:27:03.320 --> 05:27:04.670 align:start position:0%
it the district shall provide student
address

05:27:04.670 --> 05:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:27:07.070 --> 05:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
information for the purpose of
 
05:27:09.868 --> 05:27:09.878 align:start position:0%
Distributing uh
 
05:27:13.270 --> 05:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
results but the department May provide
 
05:27:15.990 --> 05:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
those results to parents or school I'm
 
05:27:19.350 --> 05:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure why the district is
 
05:27:21.708 --> 05:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
going to provide
 
05:27:25.470 --> 05:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
information and the department may or
 
05:27:29.310 --> 05:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
may not request the entity to provide
 
05:27:31.548 --> 05:27:31.558 align:start position:0%
the info to schools
 
05:27:36.110 --> 05:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh I I believe uh that the uh Department
 
05:27:37.788 --> 05:27:37.798 align:start position:0%
could send out the results through that
 
05:27:41.390 --> 05:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
address or the excuse me keep trying to
 
05:27:43.548 --> 05:27:43.558 align:start position:0%
say that the tested agency could send
 
05:27:45.350 --> 05:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
out the results with that student
 
05:27:47.948 --> 05:27:47.958 align:start position:0%
address but they're not excuse me a
 
05:27:50.708 --> 05:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair yes you may okay so
 
05:27:52.868 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
when I read this the department May
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
provide or may request the testing
 
05:27:57.868 --> 05:27:57.878 align:start position:0%
entity to provide the assessment results
 
05:28:00.150 --> 05:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
and comparative data to apparent illegal
 
05:28:00.160 --> 05:28:00.948 align:start position:0%
and comparative data to apparent illegal
guard

05:28:00.948 --> 05:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
guard
 
05:28:03.670 --> 05:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
the people's schools it doesn't say that
 
05:28:07.868 --> 05:28:07.878 align:start position:0%
the department shall provide or request
 
05:28:10.750 --> 05:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
that the testing entity will provide or
 
05:28:13.788 --> 05:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
shall provide it seems rather optional
 
05:28:15.910 --> 05:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
with again with the use of the word may
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
that's I I I have that
 
05:28:21.510 --> 05:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
concern I I will look at that thank you
 
05:28:21.520 --> 05:28:22.390 align:start position:0%
concern I I will look at that thank you
you're

05:28:22.390 --> 05:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:28:25.230 --> 05:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
welcome uh represent Tanner then
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
represent of my
 
05:28:29.590 --> 05:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
own okay I'm G to try it again can you
 
05:28:35.628 --> 05:28:35.638 align:start position:0%
hear me yes okay my concern is the um
 
05:28:39.948 --> 05:28:39.958 align:start position:0%
destroying the test testing data uh the
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
time limit uh set to um students through
 
05:28:45.230 --> 05:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
8th grade or when a student is no longer
 
05:28:46.670 --> 05:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the New Hampshire Public
 
05:28:49.548 --> 05:28:49.558 align:start position:0%
School seems to me that they need to
 
05:28:52.150 --> 05:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
retain that data for at least a year or
 
05:28:54.990 --> 05:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
two in case there is some reason that
 
05:28:58.628 --> 05:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
this student re leaves the school um
 
05:29:02.110 --> 05:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
decides to come back uh there in this
 
05:29:03.910 --> 05:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
day and age there's a lot of movement
 
05:29:06.190 --> 05:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
back and forth and then the the data
 
05:29:09.070 --> 05:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
isn't there so um I would strongly
 
05:29:13.590 --> 05:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
suggest we at least put two years down
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
there what's your feeling on that um
 
05:29:21.070 --> 05:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
thank you are you uh thinking of uh uh
 
05:29:23.110 --> 05:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
the instance when uh they might leave
 
05:29:28.670 --> 05:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:32.270 --> 05:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
Yes I I see it up in our area a as well
 
05:29:34.750 --> 05:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
as the beautiful lakes area I'm sure
 
05:29:37.310 --> 05:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
we've seen an influx of people come in
 
05:29:40.548 --> 05:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
with coid established residency here so
 
05:29:42.270 --> 05:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
that their children can attend school
 
05:29:44.230 --> 05:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure after cold snaps like we
 
05:29:46.910 --> 05:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
just had they may be fast returning
 
05:29:51.150 --> 05:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:54.868 --> 05:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
subsides I if I might respond yes you I
 
05:29:56.590 --> 05:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
would disagree that they they're still
 
05:29:57.470 --> 05:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:30:01.150 --> 05:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
leave even with the co snap but uh
 
05:30:05.070 --> 05:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
uh we have a lot of skar um so uh but I
 
05:30:08.270 --> 05:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
will take uh your comment under
 
05:30:10.310 --> 05:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
consideration about the uh leaving the
 
05:30:13.590 --> 05:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire public school thank
 
05:30:16.070 --> 05:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
you further questions of Representative
 
05:30:18.350 --> 05:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
cordelli yes representative Miler thank
 
05:30:21.430 --> 05:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair representative cordelli you
 
05:30:22.830 --> 05:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
might not be able to answer this
 
05:30:25.708 --> 05:30:25.718 align:start position:0%
question but one of the concerns I have
 
05:30:29.230 --> 05:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
is that if this information is sent
 
05:30:30.868 --> 05:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
directly to parents
 
05:30:36.868 --> 05:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
parents it may uh it may impact school
 
05:30:39.548 --> 05:30:39.558 align:start position:0%
districts who use this data as a
 
05:30:39.558 --> 05:30:41.030 align:start position:0%
districts who use this data as a
diagnostic

05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
diagnostic
 
05:30:43.830 --> 05:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
tool and I know some of the school
 
05:30:46.750 --> 05:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
districts basically use this information
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
to diagnose exactly where students are
 
05:30:52.910 --> 05:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
in their learning path and they talk
 
05:30:56.830 --> 05:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
with parents about that my concern is is
 
05:31:00.350 --> 05:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
that by directly sending it to parents
 
05:31:03.990 --> 05:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
it may interrupt that process of using
 
05:31:07.070 --> 05:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
it as a diagnostic tool in working with
 
05:31:09.868 --> 05:31:09.878 align:start position:0%
parents in developing learning plans Etc
 
05:31:11.788 --> 05:31:11.798 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts about how that
 
05:31:16.070 --> 05:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
might interrupt that diagnostic
 
05:31:19.110 --> 05:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
process did the school will still have
 
05:31:22.830 --> 05:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
the result off as well um and I think
 
05:31:27.150 --> 05:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
that parents getting the um uh data U
 
05:31:29.948 --> 05:31:29.958 align:start position:0%
might spur them to contact the district
 
05:31:32.310 --> 05:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
and and uh request a conference to uh
 
05:31:35.670 --> 05:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
review the U the data with them and and
 
05:31:38.430 --> 05:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
spur that diagnostic analysis that you
 
05:31:38.440 --> 05:31:39.350 align:start position:0%
spur that diagnostic analysis that you
speak

05:31:39.350 --> 05:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
speak
 
05:31:42.470 --> 05:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
of thank
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:49.430 --> 05:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any further
 
05:31:53.230 --> 05:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
questions uh I will go ahead then seeing
 
05:31:55.390 --> 05:31:55.400 align:start position:0%
that we're in a kind of a split session
 
05:31:57.390 --> 05:31:57.400 align:start position:0%
here I'm going to start the second Bill
 
05:31:59.750 --> 05:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
well first of all uh represent Hobson
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
are there any people wanting to talk
 
05:32:05.070 --> 05:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
about that specific Bill not that I can
 
05:32:08.150 --> 05:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
see okay so what we don't see anybody in
 
05:32:10.390 --> 05:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
the you know waiting in the in the limbs
 
05:32:18.990 --> 05:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:21.910 --> 05:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
minute oh
 
05:32:25.070 --> 05:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay we have one one person would
 
05:32:27.310 --> 05:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
like to uh come on and testify Miss
 
05:32:39.510 --> 05:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:43.788 --> 05:32:43.798 align:start position:0%
okay am I live yes oh hi everyone okay
 
05:32:46.150 --> 05:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
um this is all a new world so I thought
 
05:32:48.910 --> 05:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
that I had um properly signed up to
 
05:32:51.548 --> 05:32:51.558 align:start position:0%
testify virtually so apologies if I did
 
05:32:54.190 --> 05:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
it incorrectly but it's nice to see you
 
05:32:57.788 --> 05:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
all um hello chairman lad and represent
 
05:33:02.190 --> 05:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
cordelli um wanted to to uh pop in and
 
05:33:04.670 --> 05:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
just a little clarification was given in
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
repes of cordell's comments but we share
 
05:33:10.708 --> 05:33:10.718 align:start position:0%
some concern around the same sentiment
 
05:33:12.830 --> 05:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
as representative Tanner um and again
 
05:33:15.310 --> 05:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
Ashley Gibson with the college board so
 
05:33:17.110 --> 05:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
um we work closely with the state uh
 
05:33:18.310 --> 05:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
being an
 
05:33:21.670 --> 05:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
SAT um High School assessment State and
 
05:33:24.350 --> 05:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
specifically around um the testing
 
05:33:27.590 --> 05:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
entity shall destroy data after the
 
05:33:29.470 --> 05:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
student is done in New Hampshire Public
 
05:33:29.480 --> 05:33:30.708 align:start position:0%
student is done in New Hampshire Public
Schools

05:33:30.708 --> 05:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
Schools
 
05:33:34.070 --> 05:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
um our concern lies within students who
 
05:33:36.190 --> 05:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
request their scores after they're done
 
05:33:37.830 --> 05:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
with high school for scholarship
 
05:33:41.070 --> 05:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
purposes transferring institutions some
 
05:33:44.150 --> 05:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
people don't go to their postsecondary
 
05:33:46.430 --> 05:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
education right after high school and
 
05:33:47.868 --> 05:33:47.878 align:start position:0%
then still request their college
 
05:33:50.548 --> 05:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
entrance exam score so that's something
 
05:33:52.670 --> 05:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
we want to put on your radar as a
 
05:33:56.390 --> 05:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
concern um we don't want it to be um we
 
05:33:59.030 --> 05:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
don't want it to be a barrier to a
 
05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
student opportunity if they are done
 
05:34:03.070 --> 05:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
with school at a New Hampshire Public
 
05:34:06.110 --> 05:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
School have taken the sat in high school
 
05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
or even on a Saturday um and then come
 
05:34:14.548 --> 05:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
to us requesting their score for some
 
05:34:16.830 --> 05:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity and and we have
 
05:34:19.270 --> 05:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
to tell them that we in fact can't give
 
05:34:21.910 --> 05:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
it to them because of the state statute
 
05:34:25.310 --> 05:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
so um the the the overall intent of the
 
05:34:28.190 --> 05:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
bill we are in support of but we don't
 
05:34:31.110 --> 05:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
want any sort of unint intended
 
05:34:33.190 --> 05:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
consequences um placing barriers to
 
05:34:35.628 --> 05:34:35.638 align:start position:0%
student opportunities so wanted to come
 
05:34:38.590 --> 05:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
and present that concern to the
 
05:34:40.548 --> 05:34:40.558 align:start position:0%
committee um represent cordelli you have
 
05:34:42.708 --> 05:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
an email in your inbox from me if you
 
05:34:45.030 --> 05:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten to it already um because

weekend so um I'm happy to take any
 
05:34:54.430 --> 05:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
questions but that's simply Our concern
 
05:34:56.110 --> 05:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
we don't want a student to not have
 
05:34:59.470 --> 05:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
access to their score um for whatever
 
05:35:01.830 --> 05:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
opportun they might want to take in the

administrator for assessment and I just
 
05:35:58.948 --> 05:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to make myself available for any
 
05:36:00.948 --> 05:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the assessment
 
05:36:03.548 --> 05:36:03.558 align:start position:0%
system and just to clarify uh a couple
 
05:36:05.628 --> 05:36:05.638 align:start position:0%
of things about our assessment system if
 
05:36:06.948 --> 05:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:36:10.190 --> 05:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead so our New Hampshire
 
05:36:12.350 --> 05:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
assessment system consists of several
 
05:36:14.910 --> 05:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
assessment systems sat you just heard
 
05:36:16.990 --> 05:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
about for our 11th grade students for
 
05:36:19.390 --> 05:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
ELA and Mathematics we have our New
 
05:36:20.990 --> 05:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire SAS or
 
05:36:24.548 --> 05:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
nhas which assesses our students in ela
 
05:36:26.830 --> 05:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
and Mathematics from 3D through 8th
 
05:36:30.030 --> 05:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
grade are NH SAS also assesses our
 
05:36:34.910 --> 05:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
students in science in grades 5 8 and 11
 
05:36:37.070 --> 05:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
we also have our Dynamic learning Maps
 
05:36:38.830 --> 05:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
assessment and that's our alternate
 
05:36:40.628 --> 05:36:40.638 align:start position:0%
assessment for our severely disabled
 
05:36:43.190 --> 05:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
students that um the New Hampshire SAS
 
05:36:45.670 --> 05:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
test is not appropriate for and they
 
05:36:48.030 --> 05:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
would take that test in ela Math and
 
05:36:50.948 --> 05:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
Science from grades three through 8 and
 
05:36:54.548 --> 05:36:54.558 align:start position:0%
also 11th our final assessment uh
 
05:36:56.150 --> 05:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
assessment that's part of our assessment
 
05:36:59.670 --> 05:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
system is our access test which is the
 
05:37:01.230 --> 05:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
requ ired assessment our English
 
05:37:04.628 --> 05:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
language Learners take to um look at
 
05:37:07.150 --> 05:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
their English language proficiency our
 
05:37:10.190 --> 05:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
students take that from kindergarten all
 
05:37:12.910 --> 05:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
the way until 12th grade and so I just
 
05:37:15.030 --> 05:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
want to make it clear that it's not just
 
05:37:16.788 --> 05:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
past 8th grade that we would need that
 
05:37:18.948 --> 05:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
data for some of our students we would
 
05:37:20.350 --> 05:37:20.360 align:start position:0%
actually need that data from
 
05:37:22.150 --> 05:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
kindergarten all the way through 12th
 
05:37:23.830 --> 05:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
grade and that's just the ability to
 
05:37:25.350 --> 05:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're supporting them and
 
05:37:27.788 --> 05:37:27.798 align:start position:0%
providing um the services that they need
 
05:37:29.390 --> 05:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
and the school's ability to be able to
 
05:37:31.230 --> 05:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
keep keep that data and so when we're
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
looking at an assessment system it's it
 
05:37:36.510 --> 05:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
goes um just beyond third through 8th
 
05:37:38.390 --> 05:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
grade or just beyond eth grade we we are
 
05:37:41.470 --> 05:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
looking at kindergarten through 12th
 
05:37:43.310 --> 05:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
grade thank
 
05:37:45.628 --> 05:37:45.638 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
05:37:48.390 --> 05:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much uh we will go
 
05:37:51.868 --> 05:37:51.878 align:start position:0%
ahead now and go straight into the other
 
05:37:55.150 --> 05:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
Bill uh HB
 
05:37:57.750 --> 05:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
323 uh at this point in time I'll turn
 
05:38:01.390 --> 05:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
the gavl over to representative
 
05:38:04.948 --> 05:38:04.958 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you Mr chairman uh
 
05:38:08.708 --> 05:38:08.718 align:start position:0%
this time I would like to open the he on
 
05:38:10.910 --> 05:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:38:13.110 --> 05:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
323 which
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
is similar title uh coincidentally
 
05:38:18.750 --> 05:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
relative to a Statewide student
 
05:38:21.350 --> 05:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
assessment report thank you thank you
 
05:38:22.948 --> 05:38:22.958 align:start position:0%
very much representa cordelli and
 
05:38:24.430 --> 05:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
05:38:26.510 --> 05:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
my name is Rick lad I come from hail
 
05:38:29.868 --> 05:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
Grafton 4 um yes we just heard from the
 
05:38:32.548 --> 05:38:32.558 align:start position:0%
Department uh about the state Assessment
 
05:38:35.910 --> 05:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
program um we are specifically looking
 
05:38:38.910 --> 05:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
at in this bill the Statewide assessment
 
05:38:42.430 --> 05:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
which is required by Essa and that is
 
05:38:45.270 --> 05:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
grades three through eight a separate
 
05:38:48.350 --> 05:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
test then what you see at we're required
 
05:38:50.430 --> 05:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
to do it in one grade in the high school
 
05:38:53.468 --> 05:38:53.478 align:start position:0%
level we opt for grade 11 and that is
 
05:38:56.750 --> 05:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
the SAT in this state we also have the
 
05:39:01.350 --> 05:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
option if so desired to use the ACT but
 
05:39:05.788 --> 05:39:05.798 align:start position:0%
we're using sat so uh my my concerns are
 
05:39:08.708 --> 05:39:08.718 align:start position:0%
that this is a a mandated test by the
 
05:39:11.990 --> 05:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
federal government and this bill
 
05:39:14.310 --> 05:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
requires schools to produce and provide
 
05:39:16.468 --> 05:39:16.478 align:start position:0%
to parents teachers and principles an
 
05:39:20.030 --> 05:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
annual assessment report by June 30th of
 
05:39:23.628 --> 05:39:23.638 align:start position:0%
each year the every student succeeds act
 
05:39:25.990 --> 05:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
along with the Federal Regulations
 
05:39:28.110 --> 05:39:28.120 align:start position:0%
requires that results from the annual
 
05:39:31.830 --> 05:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
academic assessment given each spring be
 
05:39:34.788 --> 05:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
quote provided to parents and teachers
 
05:39:38.310 --> 05:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
as soon as practicable poss practically
 
05:39:42.350 --> 05:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
possible after the test is taken in an
 
05:39:45.150 --> 05:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
understandable and uniform format and to
 
05:39:47.670 --> 05:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
the extent practicable provided in a
 
05:39:50.510 --> 05:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
language that the parents can understand
 
05:39:53.628 --> 05:39:53.638 align:start position:0%
that is from Federal Regulation so we
 
05:39:56.750 --> 05:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
have to have that provided to parents it
 
05:39:58.948 --> 05:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
has been communicated to the committee
 
05:40:00.230 --> 05:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
05:40:02.070 --> 05:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
and I have again learned just the other
 
05:40:05.030 --> 05:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
day when I was at thee that it still
 
05:40:08.110 --> 05:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
continues that in some school situations
 
05:40:09.468 --> 05:40:09.478 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to mention the
 
05:40:12.590 --> 05:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
specific schools test results are not
 
05:40:14.590 --> 05:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
provided to parents until the start of
 
05:40:17.948 --> 05:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
the next school year the next school
 
05:40:20.548 --> 05:40:20.558 align:start position:0%
calendar this is certainly not a timely
 
05:40:23.150 --> 05:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
process and does not provide a parent of
 
05:40:26.230 --> 05:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
a child who needs academic assistance
 
05:40:28.868 --> 05:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
the summer months for needed remediation
 
05:40:31.948 --> 05:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
or or Improvement so they don't
 
05:40:33.788 --> 05:40:33.798 align:start position:0%
understand or they're not receiving the
 
05:40:36.310 --> 05:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
information till later on in fall in
 
05:40:39.670 --> 05:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
some kind cases this bill was developed
 
05:40:41.548 --> 05:40:41.558 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of ensuring that parents
 
05:40:43.310 --> 05:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
would receive testing results in a
 
05:40:46.548 --> 05:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
timely and informative manner receiving
 
05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
test information four months after
 
05:40:51.590 --> 05:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
taking the assessment as I see it is
 
05:40:52.910 --> 05:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
just not
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
acceptable the Statewide assessment test
 
05:41:00.830 --> 05:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
is an achievement test which identifies
 
05:41:03.510 --> 05:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
growth and from that
 
05:41:06.750 --> 05:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
test children are seen as level one
 
05:41:09.670 --> 05:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
level two level three or level four
 
05:41:12.350 --> 05:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
level three is proficient level four is
 
05:41:14.430 --> 05:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
you're highly proficient level one and
 
05:41:17.270 --> 05:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
two two is where you're slightly below
 
05:41:20.110 --> 05:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
and one you're you're you need a lot of
 
05:41:24.430 --> 05:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
help and we use this in many cases when
 
05:41:26.910 --> 05:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
we're directing funds to schools to
 
05:41:29.510 --> 05:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
identify grade levels or levels of
 
05:41:32.708 --> 05:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
achievement these students are in so
 
05:41:35.990 --> 05:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's my concern that this data is
 
05:41:39.670 --> 05:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
available to schools quickly soon after
 
05:41:42.548 --> 05:41:42.558 align:start position:0%
the test is taken it's computerized now
 
05:41:45.350 --> 05:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
so it is available but we're not getting
 
05:41:47.190 --> 05:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
it out in a timely
 
05:41:49.628 --> 05:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
manner so there may be a lot of
 
05:41:52.670 --> 05:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
individual Co causes in schools but
 
05:41:54.910 --> 05:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
really it does result in unintended
 
05:41:57.468 --> 05:41:57.478 align:start position:0%
consequences when parents cannot offer
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
our uh offer our
 
05:42:01.868 --> 05:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
make available to the students that
 
05:42:05.110 --> 05:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
needed support that is necessary to keep
 
05:42:08.070 --> 05:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
them on track for the next school year
 
05:42:10.590 --> 05:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
this is going to be very important after
 
05:42:12.750 --> 05:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
what we've going through this year when
 
05:42:14.390 --> 05:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
students haven't had the opportunity to
 
05:42:16.548 --> 05:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
be in classrooms the way they were in
 
05:42:19.948 --> 05:42:19.958 align:start position:0%
quote normal sessions and parents are
 
05:42:22.788 --> 05:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
anxious to find out what uh how their
 
05:42:25.310 --> 05:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
students are progressing I'm not laying
 
05:42:27.390 --> 05:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
blame on anybody I understand this is
 
05:42:30.590 --> 05:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
coid and you know I have have uh three
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
days a week I've got middle school kids
 
05:42:34.750 --> 05:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
in my family right there in the house
 
05:42:37.468 --> 05:42:37.478 align:start position:0%
and I have become the teacher and it's
 
05:42:40.070 --> 05:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's quite frankly I just
 
05:42:42.788 --> 05:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
you know really put all teachers on a
 
05:42:45.150 --> 05:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
Podium a pedestal they do a wonderful
 
05:42:48.270 --> 05:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
job and I recognize how difficult that
 
05:42:50.868 --> 05:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
chore is that profession I've been a
 
05:42:54.310 --> 05:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
teacher myself so in conclusion this
 
05:42:58.270 --> 05:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
bill simply states that the 30th of June
 
05:43:00.390 --> 05:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
is when those test have to be results
 
05:43:02.948 --> 05:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
have to be out by the commissioner has
 
05:43:05.708 --> 05:43:05.718 align:start position:0%
the option to Grant an exception based
 
05:43:09.110 --> 05:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
upon some some situation and that's
 
05:43:10.590 --> 05:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
written commissioner May Grant an
 
05:43:13.510 --> 05:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
exception to the June 30 deadline so in
 
05:43:16.030 --> 05:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
conclusion this bill is set up so that
 
05:43:18.230 --> 05:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
we can get parents the information they
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
need in a timely manner thank you very
 
05:43:24.590 --> 05:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
much thank you I see a few hands up
 
05:43:27.670 --> 05:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
there uh representative luno thank you
 
05:43:29.750 --> 05:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
very much uh Mr chair and thank you very
 
05:43:32.750 --> 05:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
much um representative lad for U for
 
05:43:35.830 --> 05:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill now uh as you know
 
05:43:39.510 --> 05:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh having served on the um on the uh
 
05:43:42.030 --> 05:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
school funding commission uh one of the
 
05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
things that we learned um during that um
 
05:43:49.510 --> 05:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
um 11 months of work was the strong
 
05:43:52.788 --> 05:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
correlation between student outcomes and
 
05:43:56.468 --> 05:43:56.478 align:start position:0%
poverty and in particular poverty as as
 
05:43:59.990 --> 05:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
calculated by um uh
 
05:44:03.150 --> 05:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh the number of students in a in a
 
05:44:05.350 --> 05:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
district that enroll in the free and
 
05:44:10.948 --> 05:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch program so so
 
05:44:13.910 --> 05:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
looking at uh at that report and the
 
05:44:16.788 --> 05:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
findings in that report there was very
 
05:44:19.350 --> 05:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
that that correlation existed exists I
 
05:44:22.468 --> 05:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
mean and um
 
05:44:26.110 --> 05:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
and in developing that correlation or in
 
05:44:29.270 --> 05:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
determining that correlation uh uh uh
 
05:44:32.548 --> 05:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
much time was was spent to understand
 
05:44:35.350 --> 05:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
how districts how students in districts
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh perform and so uh so my question uh
 
05:44:43.110 --> 05:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
really goes to this bill how is this
 
05:44:46.510 --> 05:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
going to um going to help let's say the
 
05:44:50.868 --> 05:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
13,000 kids in um in Manchester the
 
05:44:53.670 --> 05:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District that on
 
05:44:53.680 --> 05:44:54.750 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District that on
average

05:44:54.750 --> 05:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
average
 
05:44:58.510 --> 05:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
underperform U State averages by two
 
05:44:58.520 --> 05:44:59.430 align:start position:0%
underperform U State averages by two
standard

05:44:59.430 --> 05:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
standard
 
05:45:02.510 --> 05:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
deviations which um let me just put that
 
05:45:05.030 --> 05:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
in relative terms if State average is
 
05:45:07.350 --> 05:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
the 50th percentile two standard
 
05:45:09.830 --> 05:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
deviations is about the second
 
05:45:12.948 --> 05:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
percentile um so um so just wondering
 
05:45:15.230 --> 05:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
how this is going to help those
 
05:45:20.468 --> 05:45:20.478 align:start position:0%
kids um to start with uh in 2018 when I
 
05:45:23.150 --> 05:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
was on the ugger study there that looked
 
05:45:26.070 --> 05:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
that task force and Mel Meer you are on
 
05:45:30.830 --> 05:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
that as well um I did a a look back at
 
05:45:33.230 --> 05:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
achievement tests for a number of years
 
05:45:36.510 --> 05:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
I produced a sheet based upon smarter
 
05:45:38.110 --> 05:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
balance and some of the preceding
 
05:45:41.468 --> 05:45:41.478 align:start position:0%
achievement tests that we've used and
 
05:45:43.990 --> 05:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
using the equalized property valuation
 
05:45:45.990 --> 05:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
per pupil is what we used and it's
 
05:45:49.270 --> 05:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
similar to what you're speaking to we
 
05:45:51.150 --> 05:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
found that in the bottom
 
05:45:53.990 --> 05:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
quartile of those districts with low
 
05:45:56.830 --> 05:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
equalized property valuation there was a
 
05:45:58.868 --> 05:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
very high percentage of students with
 
05:46:01.628 --> 05:46:01.638 align:start position:0%
which were in the lower levels of
 
05:46:04.868 --> 05:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
achievement level one in mathematics and
 
05:46:08.150 --> 05:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
and language arts reading as well uh and
 
05:46:11.190 --> 05:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
level two as you went up to the top
 
05:46:13.510 --> 05:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
quartile as far as when you're getting
 
05:46:15.430 --> 05:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
now close to you know well over a
 
05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars equalized property
 
05:46:19.948 --> 05:46:19.958 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil the it started
 
05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
reversing in fact it was reversed it was
 
05:46:25.390 --> 05:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
almost like totally opposite each other
 
05:46:28.590 --> 05:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
from end to end so we do know that in
 
05:46:30.590 --> 05:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
this districts where there is a low
 
05:46:33.910 --> 05:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
level of uh property value which pretty
 
05:46:35.788 --> 05:46:35.798 align:start position:0%
much correlates to what we talked about
 
05:46:37.230 --> 05:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
what represent Luna talked about in the
 
05:46:41.230 --> 05:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
free reduced meals as well um those are
 
05:46:43.070 --> 05:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
the students which we need to really
 
05:46:45.910 --> 05:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
support but in order to really support
 
05:46:48.510 --> 05:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
these students it can't come just from
 
05:46:50.788 --> 05:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
the school it also has to come from the
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
family and the achievement test is
 
05:46:57.270 --> 05:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
developed to show growth we used to only
 
05:46:59.310 --> 05:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
get use that achievement
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
score and and still and we used to say
 
05:47:05.948 --> 05:47:05.958 align:start position:0%
to a family or to a student you're still
 
05:47:08.830 --> 05:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
down around under the bar maybe at the
 
05:47:10.830 --> 05:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
30th percentile
 
05:47:13.070 --> 05:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
level but they may have been the year
 
05:47:16.190 --> 05:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
before that at the 20th percentile level
 
05:47:18.910 --> 05:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
so what we want to key in on is these
 
05:47:20.948 --> 05:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
students are learning they're growing
 
05:47:23.628 --> 05:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
there's growth shown and that's what we
 
05:47:25.990 --> 05:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
got to convey but we got to convey that
 
05:47:29.548 --> 05:47:29.558 align:start position:0%
to the parent um as as quickly as
 
05:47:31.830 --> 05:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
possible so that they also can be a
 
05:47:34.830 --> 05:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
partner in education and be working at
 
05:47:37.548 --> 05:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
home with the student and working on
 
05:47:41.150 --> 05:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
areas that we we we see as needing that
 
05:47:43.350 --> 05:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
growth the achievement tests we're
 
05:47:46.270 --> 05:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
giving are really not diagnostic tests
 
05:47:48.910 --> 05:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
their test to show overall achievement
 
05:47:51.390 --> 05:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
and a broad range of skills and
 
05:47:54.230 --> 05:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge so that if we can convey that
 
05:47:56.750 --> 05:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible to parents they
 
05:47:59.110 --> 05:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
become Partners in where we're going and
 
05:48:01.110 --> 05:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
I believe through a process of doing
 
05:48:03.830 --> 05:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
this quickly and in a timely manner that
 
05:48:07.590 --> 05:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
partnership grows and and I I know that
 
05:48:09.430 --> 05:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
right now I wish I had some of that with
 
05:48:11.070 --> 05:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
the kids going to school just two days a
 
05:48:13.150 --> 05:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
week and the kids come home oh I doing
 
05:48:15.468 --> 05:48:15.478 align:start position:0%
well but the homework's not getting done
 
05:48:18.590 --> 05:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
and and so there communication is a key
 
05:48:21.990 --> 05:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
these tests are a key and and one
 
05:48:25.030 --> 05:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
component and to make a long story short
 
05:48:26.948 --> 05:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
we need to have better Communications
 
05:48:28.868 --> 05:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
with the other part of the story that's
 
05:48:30.990 --> 05:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
the parent which is responsible for
 
05:48:33.430 --> 05:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
educating that child as
 
05:48:37.070 --> 05:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
well follow up Mr chair real
 
05:48:40.468 --> 05:48:40.478 align:start position:0%
quick yes so thanks very much Mr chair
 
05:48:42.310 --> 05:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
and and representative lad I largely
 
05:48:45.548 --> 05:48:45.558 align:start position:0%
agree with with with what you um uh were
 
05:48:47.948 --> 05:48:47.958 align:start position:0%
just saying uh with the exception a
 
05:48:49.788 --> 05:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
couple of exceptions that there's a
 
05:48:51.788 --> 05:48:51.798 align:start position:0%
significant difference between uh
 
05:48:54.548 --> 05:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
equalized property value per pupil and
 
05:48:57.788 --> 05:48:57.798 align:start position:0%
uh and poverty in a district so um so
 
05:49:00.190 --> 05:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example ex Le the um
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
the the town that the that that that um
 
05:49:07.708 --> 05:49:07.718 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli represents has
 
05:49:09.990 --> 05:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
um has a very very high equalized
 
05:49:11.788 --> 05:49:11.798 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil but there are
 
05:49:13.590 --> 05:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
certainly pockets of poverty and there
 
05:49:15.390 --> 05:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
are certainly families that are
 
05:49:17.948 --> 05:49:17.958 align:start position:0%
impoverished that um that also live in
 
05:49:19.190 --> 05:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
that community and that's something that
 
05:49:22.230 --> 05:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
we see around the entire state that
 
05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
situation is is exacerbated in our more
 
05:49:29.270 --> 05:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
um U urban areas such as is Manchester
 
05:49:31.070 --> 05:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
and nashaa which actually have the
 
05:49:34.190 --> 05:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
highest incidence of um of of poverty in
 
05:49:36.350 --> 05:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
the state so getting back to the point
 
05:49:38.230 --> 05:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
you were making representative lad which
 
05:49:40.948 --> 05:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
is very good that improved communication
 
05:49:42.910 --> 05:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
between the school district and the and
 
05:49:44.788 --> 05:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
the students and families is really
 
05:49:46.948 --> 05:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
important in order to help those
 
05:49:49.670 --> 05:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
students raise their their performance
 
05:49:53.868 --> 05:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
levels I I guess it's it's it's it's not
 
05:49:57.750 --> 05:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
striking me how that's being done um in
 
05:50:00.628 --> 05:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
an effective manner with with a letter
 
05:50:02.910 --> 05:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
coming from either directly from the
 
05:50:05.670 --> 05:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
Department or from the uh from the from
 
05:50:09.030 --> 05:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
the test agency to the um uh to the
 
05:50:11.548 --> 05:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
student but uh but I think what we heard
 
05:50:14.830 --> 05:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
last session on this bill was that uh
 
05:50:17.788 --> 05:50:17.798 align:start position:0%
was that it had been done in a much more
 
05:50:20.030 --> 05:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll just use the term caring
 
05:50:24.030 --> 05:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
approach uh you with um with u Council
 
05:50:28.150 --> 05:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
staff at uh at the student school and um
 
05:50:32.830 --> 05:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
to try to provide the um the the tools
 
05:50:36.390 --> 05:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh for those families to um um uh to
 
05:50:37.788 --> 05:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
improve the students
 
05:50:40.270 --> 05:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
performance I'd like to respond to that
 
05:50:44.390 --> 05:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh represent luno um I understand that
 
05:50:45.990 --> 05:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
have places like Lincoln where the
 
05:50:48.350 --> 05:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
property values are high and you have
 
05:50:52.590 --> 05:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
large Pro pockets of poverty where um uh
 
05:50:56.230 --> 05:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
the locals live and uh and so there are
 
05:50:58.070 --> 05:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
differences between equalized property
 
05:51:00.670 --> 05:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
value for pupil and the number of kids
 
05:51:02.670 --> 05:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
which are for example in Title One Part
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
4 b um so um but I I I getting to the
 
05:51:11.310 --> 05:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
last part of what you were stating
 
05:51:15.030 --> 05:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
the the need to get this information to
 
05:51:19.110 --> 05:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
the parent prior to everybody closing
 
05:51:21.030 --> 05:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
shop at the school walking out the door
 
05:51:24.350 --> 05:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
and going home for this the summer break
 
05:51:28.030 --> 05:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
is important the if the parent has that
 
05:51:28.040 --> 05:51:29.468 align:start position:0%
is important the if the parent has that
information

05:51:29.468 --> 05:51:29.478 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:51:31.830 --> 05:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
by the close of school the parent then
 
05:51:34.830 --> 05:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
has the opportunity to go to school talk
 
05:51:36.990 --> 05:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
with the teacher while the teacher is
 
05:51:40.070 --> 05:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
still there and say okay I want to work
 
05:51:43.270 --> 05:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
with my child what do you recommend Mr
 
05:51:46.070 --> 05:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
or Mrs teacher and how can I move
 
05:51:48.270 --> 05:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
forward to help my child in this
 
05:51:53.868 --> 05:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
mathematics so there is no excuse for a
 
05:51:55.990 --> 05:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
school to be holding on to this
 
05:51:57.990 --> 05:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
information and saying well we'll just
 
05:51:59.708 --> 05:51:59.718 align:start position:0%
get it out when the secretaries come
 
05:52:03.468 --> 05:52:03.478 align:start position:0%
back to the office here or etc etc all
 
05:52:05.708 --> 05:52:05.718 align:start position:0%
my years as a school principal and
 
05:52:08.390 --> 05:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
Elementary School principal we got this
 
05:52:10.628 --> 05:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
information back in a timely manner and
 
05:52:13.468 --> 05:52:13.478 align:start position:0%
as soon as it hit the the school it was
 
05:52:16.468 --> 05:52:16.478 align:start position:0%
out to the parents and we had parent
 
05:52:20.190 --> 05:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
conferences before we closed shop we
 
05:52:22.868 --> 05:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
were and that's how you get a school to
 
05:52:25.430 --> 05:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
go from level one to two to three is
 
05:52:28.030 --> 05:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
that so I'll I'll leave it at that thank
 
05:52:28.040 --> 05:52:29.750 align:start position:0%
that so I'll I'll leave it at that thank
you

05:52:29.750 --> 05:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:52:32.868 --> 05:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much M representative
 
05:52:35.628 --> 05:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
vad thank you representative
 
05:52:37.910 --> 05:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chairman uh
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
represent lad thank you for your
 
05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
comments I want to just bring back some
 
05:52:43.990 --> 05:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
history and then a question if I may
 
05:52:46.390 --> 05:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
last year when we heard this bill
 
05:52:49.548 --> 05:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
similarly um the some of the School
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
departments that were present to testify
 
05:52:55.030 --> 05:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh in that other world of testifying uh
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
indicated their concern was that they
 
05:53:00.590 --> 05:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have a chance to provide students
 
05:53:03.150 --> 05:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
support they needed when theyed when the
 
05:53:05.868 --> 05:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
student left at June 20th 26 they didn't
 
05:53:08.548 --> 05:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
have program then and they they thought
 
05:53:10.788 --> 05:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
at least the the school administrators
 
05:53:12.670 --> 05:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
were presenting that they were much
 
05:53:15.708 --> 05:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
better off starting with September uh
 
05:53:17.190 --> 05:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
with the information and providing
 
05:53:19.310 --> 05:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
remedial instruction helping them then I
 
05:53:20.708 --> 05:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
mean that was the pitch last year that
 
05:53:22.230 --> 05:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
they presented I understand you're June
 
05:53:26.270 --> 05:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
theth piece uh but I I I think the way
 
05:53:28.830 --> 05:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is constructed now uh with just
 
05:53:32.390 --> 05:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
June 30th and and uh I mean you can even
 
05:53:34.030 --> 05:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
mail it out by June 30th the schools are
 
05:53:35.910 --> 05:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
gone forget the remote I mean a real
 
05:53:37.868 --> 05:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
terms the school are already closed for
 
05:53:40.190 --> 05:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
the summer anyhow but when you have
 
05:53:42.948 --> 05:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
youngsters who are uh
 
05:53:46.070 --> 05:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
significantly uh subpar with their
 
05:53:48.750 --> 05:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
performance or or success level and we
 
05:53:51.110 --> 05:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
tell parents here's here's where your
 
05:53:53.350 --> 05:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
youngsters not achieving have a happy
 
05:53:55.868 --> 05:53:55.878 align:start position:0%
summer and we have you know it's really
 
05:53:58.510 --> 05:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
difficult if this was bridged with a
 
05:54:00.430 --> 05:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide programming in
 
05:54:01.990 --> 05:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
the summer for these youngsters or those
 
05:54:03.750 --> 05:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
things that would make a lot lot more
 
05:54:05.510 --> 05:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
sense this just seems to me that we're
 
05:54:07.270 --> 05:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
giving them a uh people who are already
 
05:54:10.868 --> 05:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
floundering uh no even life Lifeboat and
 
05:54:12.670 --> 05:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to be further Amplified this
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
year we see the learning loss because of
 
05:54:17.468 --> 05:54:17.478 align:start position:0%
remote learning so it's going to be I
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
think I think there's a lot of issues
 
05:54:22.110 --> 05:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
here Beyond just the simple simplified
 
05:54:23.548 --> 05:54:23.558 align:start position:0%
June 30th giving the information we're
 
05:54:25.948 --> 05:54:25.958 align:start position:0%
just putting them out there students who
 
05:54:28.190 --> 05:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
have been successful when we look at the
 
05:54:29.868 --> 05:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
the scores and we look at the income
 
05:54:32.350 --> 05:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
levels as well we know that those pizza
 
05:54:34.628 --> 05:54:34.638 align:start position:0%
kids are g a much better chance so we're
 
05:54:36.030 --> 05:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
taking the the students who have the
 
05:54:37.910 --> 05:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
most difficult opportunity to start with
 
05:54:40.030 --> 05:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
and making it more difficult so I I just
 
05:54:41.468 --> 05:54:41.478 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of things represent
 
05:54:45.270 --> 05:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
glad about this bill that that are um
 
05:54:47.990 --> 05:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
unintended and could be further improved
 
05:54:50.270 --> 05:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
to make it a great Bill uh than it sits
 
05:54:52.030 --> 05:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
right now so just curious about your
 
05:54:54.270 --> 05:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
thinking about making a a bridge bill
 
05:54:58.788 --> 05:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
with help in just a notice of I'm sorry
 
05:55:01.430 --> 05:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair there is a question
 
05:55:03.590 --> 05:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
actually yeah I I didn't get the
 
05:55:06.750 --> 05:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
question in there at all Mr Woodcock but
 
05:55:10.150 --> 05:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh um it sounds like another principal
 
05:55:13.670 --> 05:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh I I feel very strongly that I'd like
 
05:55:17.070 --> 05:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
to work with you or work with anybody so
 
05:55:20.430 --> 05:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
that we can recognize that we can come
 
05:55:22.310 --> 05:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
up with all the reasons for not
 
05:55:24.830 --> 05:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
communicating early to parents and that
 
05:55:27.230 --> 05:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
is part of our problem as Educators I'm
 
05:55:28.868 --> 05:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
putting myself in that that bag too I'm
 
05:55:28.878 --> 05:55:29.548 align:start position:0%
putting myself in that that bag too I'm
an

05:55:29.548 --> 05:55:29.558 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:55:32.788 --> 05:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
educator but it it's it's important that
 
05:55:34.590 --> 05:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
we recognize the importance of the
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
parent and if we have this information
 
05:55:37.280 --> 05:55:38.350 align:start position:0%
parent and if we have this information
Back

05:55:38.350 --> 05:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
Back
 
05:55:40.628 --> 05:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
available this is the way we're going to
 
05:55:43.510 --> 05:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
show achievement and growth um if the
 
05:55:45.788 --> 05:55:45.798 align:start position:0%
teacher that's got the kids for this
 
05:55:50.750 --> 05:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and and in the fourth grade
 
05:55:53.230 --> 05:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
has sees something going on there's a
 
05:55:54.948 --> 05:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
recommendation for summer reading you
 
05:55:56.788 --> 05:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
might want to do this you might want to
 
05:55:58.708 --> 05:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
go to your Public Library and get some
 
05:56:01.948 --> 05:56:01.958 align:start position:0%
assistance and that's all available uh
 
05:56:04.190 --> 05:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's a shame that we oftentimes get
 
05:56:07.150 --> 05:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
this data back in the fall or you know
 
05:56:11.190 --> 05:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
the parent does and and it's not looked
 
05:56:13.750 --> 05:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
at by many staff members in the school
 
05:56:16.110 --> 05:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
because they're so busy trying to close
 
05:56:18.868 --> 05:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
down but the test scores can get mailed
 
05:56:21.708 --> 05:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
out if you wait to give it out in the
 
05:56:24.390 --> 05:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
the second third fourth fifth weeks of
 
05:56:26.350 --> 05:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
the school year coming or as late as
 
05:56:28.510 --> 05:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
October that's old
 
05:56:32.030 --> 05:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
stuff um it's it's not current it's now
 
05:56:35.430 --> 05:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
how many four months old um I just don't
 
05:56:38.590 --> 05:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
get it and I I know that after talking
 
05:56:40.190 --> 05:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education the
 
05:56:45.030 --> 05:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
test results are available in the
 
05:56:47.670 --> 05:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
spring and for folks out in the field
 
05:56:50.830 --> 05:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
say we can't get it out that early um I
 
05:56:54.910 --> 05:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:58.590 --> 05:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh next is representative
 
05:56:59.948 --> 05:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
Tanner I
 
05:57:03.628 --> 05:57:03.638 align:start position:0%
believe thank you um it's been a number
 
05:57:05.150 --> 05:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
of years since I've been in the
 
05:57:08.030 --> 05:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
classroom but I remember distinctly
 
05:57:10.190 --> 05:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
having four separate grading
 
05:57:13.510 --> 05:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
periods uh having within those grading
 
05:57:16.788 --> 05:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
periods halfway uh a report that went
 
05:57:18.468 --> 05:57:18.478 align:start position:0%
home this was at the high school level a
 
05:57:21.548 --> 05:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
report that went home if a student was
 
05:57:23.628 --> 05:57:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh not performing up to their potential
 
05:57:26.670 --> 05:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
and uh getting a you know a d or a c
 
05:57:29.868 --> 05:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
minus uh um so by the time the end of
 
05:57:32.990 --> 05:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
the school year arrives uh the parents
 
05:57:35.830 --> 05:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
have had eight different um
 
05:57:38.868 --> 05:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
opportunities to see the what the
 
05:57:41.430 --> 05:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
student is actually doing in school uh
 
05:57:43.030 --> 05:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about is the high
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
stakes testing that drives so many
 
05:57:48.150 --> 05:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
people crazy both in the schools and
 
05:57:50.948 --> 05:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
without the schools outside the schools
 
05:57:52.590 --> 05:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
um to the point
 
05:57:57.390 --> 05:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
where uh it's not a good measure in most
 
05:57:59.788 --> 05:57:59.798 align:start position:0%
uh instances of what's been going on in
 
05:58:02.628 --> 05:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
the school or or for a lot of students
 
05:58:04.670 --> 05:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
what they're actually doing and it's
 
05:58:06.750 --> 05:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
hard for parents to understand that so
 
05:58:11.310 --> 05:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
my question to you is um do you expect
 
05:58:14.670 --> 05:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
that the parents will thoroughly
 
05:58:17.628 --> 05:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
understand all the all the um test
 
05:58:19.868 --> 05:58:19.878 align:start position:0%
results that come through from these
 
05:58:22.670 --> 05:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
high-stake testing and will actually
 
05:58:24.830 --> 05:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
make an opportunity to get in touch with
 
05:58:28.990 --> 05:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
the school in the fall um to see how
 
05:58:30.868 --> 05:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
things could be better or even in the
 
05:58:32.670 --> 05:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
spring if they get the testing results
 
05:58:34.948 --> 05:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
in the spring do you think parents I
 
05:58:37.468 --> 05:58:37.478 align:start position:0%
mean do you think parents really
 
05:58:39.150 --> 05:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
understand what the test results
 
05:58:41.788 --> 05:58:41.798 align:start position:0%
indicate and if they indicate completely
 
05:58:43.510 --> 05:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
different than what's been going on in
 
05:58:45.390 --> 05:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
the school during the whole year with
 
05:58:48.190 --> 05:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
all these reports going
 
05:58:51.230 --> 05:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
home represent Tanner I I don't think a
 
05:58:52.788 --> 05:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
parent going to understand terms like
 
05:58:54.868 --> 05:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
standard deviation I could sit down
 
05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
explain it to them that's not in their
 
05:58:59.590 --> 05:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
ball game how however they are aware
 
05:59:01.150 --> 05:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
that these achievement scores
 
05:59:06.110 --> 05:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
demonstrate growth um I and and I also
 
05:59:07.788 --> 05:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
believe that we've been sending this
 
05:59:10.150 --> 05:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
information home for our students in
 
05:59:14.070 --> 05:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
grades three through eight for
 
05:59:17.628 --> 05:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
years and parents get that and there's
 
05:59:19.750 --> 05:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
also a little component on the slip that
 
05:59:21.708 --> 05:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
comes it shows you the strengths and the
 
05:59:23.150 --> 05:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
weaknesses and some of the things which
 
05:59:26.110 --> 05:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
are occurring um in terms of that
 
05:59:29.510 --> 05:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
achievement score uh a parent that looks
 
05:59:31.750 --> 05:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
at that and yes some parents won't look
 
05:59:34.830 --> 05:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
at it but the majority will the majority
 
05:59:37.670 --> 05:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
will and when I as a parent would see
 
05:59:40.948 --> 05:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
something like that I would be quick to
 
05:59:43.910 --> 05:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
contact the school and say okay what can
 
05:59:46.670 --> 05:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
I do where are we going how can we work
 
05:59:51.070 --> 05:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
work together to resolve this problem um
 
05:59:53.390 --> 05:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
again I think we can find out all the
 
05:59:56.708 --> 05:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
excuses for not doing this and I I
 
05:59:59.590 --> 05:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
believe that parents are educated
 
06:00:02.350 --> 06:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
parents and parents are able to
 
06:00:04.468 --> 06:00:04.478 align:start position:0%
understand what we're sending home and
 
06:00:06.430 --> 06:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
if they don't understand it it's up to
 
06:00:09.030 --> 06:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
the school prior to them sending this
 
06:00:10.948 --> 06:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
stuff home to make sure there's an
 
06:00:12.590 --> 06:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have parents come to
 
06:00:14.628 --> 06:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
school and explain the nature of what
 
06:00:17.948 --> 06:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
our testing program is all about thank
 
06:00:20.628 --> 06:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
you thank you next we have
 
06:00:20.638 --> 06:00:22.708 align:start position:0%
you thank you next we have
representative

06:00:22.708 --> 06:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:00:25.590 --> 06:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
Mullen thank you Mr acting chair and
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lad for taking
 
06:00:31.030 --> 06:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
taking my uh comments and questions to
 
06:00:33.390 --> 06:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
heart um there's actually something in
 
06:00:36.510 --> 06:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
this bill representative lad that I love
 
06:00:38.468 --> 06:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
and that is the line that says the
 
06:00:40.468 --> 06:00:40.478 align:start position:0%
report shall be provided to parents in
 
06:00:43.230 --> 06:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
an informative and instructional manner
 
06:00:45.750 --> 06:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
to help children meet challenging State
 
06:00:48.350 --> 06:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
academic standards standards and
 
06:00:50.510 --> 06:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
advanced student learning I love that I
 
06:00:54.110 --> 06:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
love that line um my concern and I'm
 
06:00:55.788 --> 06:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have given any thought
 
06:00:59.788 --> 06:00:59.798 align:start position:0%
to this is for the school districts that
 
06:01:04.750 --> 06:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
testified last year that told us that uh
 
06:01:07.708 --> 06:01:07.718 align:start position:0%
the window of testing for some of them
 
06:01:10.110 --> 06:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
uh backed right up into the third week
 
06:01:10.120 --> 06:01:11.110 align:start position:0%
uh backed right up into the third week
in

06:01:11.110 --> 06:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:01:14.030 --> 06:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
May and that they used those test
 
06:01:16.548 --> 06:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
results that came back as part of their
 
06:01:18.910 --> 06:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
professional development over the summer
 
06:01:23.270 --> 06:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
to design remediation and stepped
 
06:01:26.430 --> 06:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
programs for kids who needed additional
 
06:01:26.440 --> 06:01:28.150 align:start position:0%
programs for kids who needed additional
support

06:01:28.150 --> 06:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
support
 
06:01:30.670 --> 06:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
and also that that in the case of a
 
06:01:32.310 --> 06:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
couple school districts we heard from
 
06:01:34.590 --> 06:01:34.600 align:start position:0%
people that said that they actually
 
06:01:36.948 --> 06:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
scheduled the parent conference at the
 
06:01:39.548 --> 06:01:39.558 align:start position:0%
beginning of the school year with the
 
06:01:41.670 --> 06:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
you know the fourth grade teacher met
 
06:01:43.468 --> 06:01:43.478 align:start position:0%
with the kids that were going off to
 
06:01:45.910 --> 06:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
fifth grade's parents in the
 
06:01:50.670 --> 06:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
fall um so my concern is um that you
 
06:01:52.948 --> 06:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
know we're giving detention to the whole
 
06:01:54.990 --> 06:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
class when five kids have
 
06:01:58.430 --> 06:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
misbehaved I'm worried that
 
06:02:01.670 --> 06:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
um there may in fact as you said there
 
06:02:03.310 --> 06:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
may be a handful of school districts out
 
06:02:04.350 --> 06:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
there that aren't doing what they're
 
06:02:08.670 --> 06:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to do but um I I I I'm just
 
06:02:11.468 --> 06:02:11.478 align:start position:0%
wondering if you are being cautious
 
06:02:14.788 --> 06:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
enough in thinking about those school
 
06:02:16.590 --> 06:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
districts that are not only doing it the
 
06:02:18.150 --> 06:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
way they're supposed to but are doing an
 
06:02:20.990 --> 06:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
exemplary job but don't meet the June
 
06:02:21.000 --> 06:02:24.590 align:start position:0%
exemplary job but don't meet the June
30th

06:02:24.590 --> 06:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:27.510 --> 06:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
deadline that make sense I I appreciate
 
06:02:29.590 --> 06:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
your comments regarding the the window
 
06:02:31.510 --> 06:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
for testing and I'm going to get that
 
06:02:34.110 --> 06:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
information for us and find out you how
 
06:02:37.310 --> 06:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
that's impacting us uh I also support
 
06:02:38.708 --> 06:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
the professional development that's
 
06:02:41.110 --> 06:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
needed and the ongoing instruction based
 
06:02:42.990 --> 06:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
upon what we're seeing in growth in the
 
06:02:47.750 --> 06:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the year to come um without a
 
06:02:50.030 --> 06:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
date like June
 
06:02:53.310 --> 06:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
30th um it will defin the distribution
 
06:02:55.510 --> 06:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
will slide into the fall for sure and
 
06:02:57.788 --> 06:02:57.798 align:start position:0%
we're missing an opportunity
 
06:03:00.868 --> 06:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
and we've seen what's happened in school
 
06:03:02.590 --> 06:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
districts where for these extended
 
06:03:04.788 --> 06:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
periods of time and we're in it right
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
now with coid how there will be a less
 
06:03:11.628 --> 06:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
of a learning curve going up than there
 
06:03:13.910 --> 06:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
would be in any normal season when the
 
06:03:15.030 --> 06:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
kids are at
 
06:03:18.788 --> 06:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
school and I think uh I'd like to see us
 
06:03:21.910 --> 06:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
work to try to get this together I do
 
06:03:24.788 --> 06:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
know that when I me mentioned it before
 
06:03:28.030 --> 06:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
to the to the committee that when I
 
06:03:30.030 --> 06:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
chaired the commission for
 
06:03:32.670 --> 06:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure funding that was $30
 
06:03:35.590 --> 06:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
million we had districts that never sent
 
06:03:38.510 --> 06:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
in an emergency management plan to doe
 
06:03:40.750 --> 06:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
or on to the Department of Safety when
 
06:03:43.350 --> 06:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
Perry plumber was director over there
 
06:03:45.750 --> 06:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
and he had people digitizing these plans
 
06:03:49.070 --> 06:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
at safety they came wanting a grant for
 
06:03:50.868 --> 06:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure for security in the
 
06:03:53.548 --> 06:03:53.558 align:start position:0%
schools Windows Doors you know systems
 
06:03:57.430 --> 06:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
cameras Etc and we looked right at them
 
06:03:59.670 --> 06:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
and said you're not going to be eligible
 
06:04:02.150 --> 06:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
to receive anything until your Grant or
 
06:04:06.430 --> 06:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
your uh plan is in here within two weeks
 
06:04:09.948 --> 06:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
we had all those plans into the
 
06:04:12.830 --> 06:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
committee so there's a
 
06:04:15.910 --> 06:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
tendency uh on the part of some school
 
06:04:17.590 --> 06:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
districts because there's so many
 
06:04:20.868 --> 06:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
reports due I got that I got it that
 
06:04:23.270 --> 06:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
things are put on somebody's desk and
 
06:04:25.750 --> 06:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
they're not done on a timely
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
manner but line is it's about the
 
06:04:30.670 --> 06:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
students it's about the growth of kids
 
06:04:32.590 --> 06:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is Bill is about so
 
06:04:35.590 --> 06:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
I'll work to try and get the information
 
06:04:39.190 --> 06:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
on the window for testing and and if
 
06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
there I know there schools I've been
 
06:04:43.910 --> 06:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
told there schools are not doing this um
 
06:04:45.270 --> 06:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get into the business
 
06:04:48.390 --> 06:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
and names I I know them uh and I don't
 
06:04:50.150 --> 06:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
think it's fair to be saying something
 
06:04:51.750 --> 06:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
without you know that it shouldn't be
 
06:04:55.230 --> 06:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
done right here so uh I'd like to work
 
06:04:57.390 --> 06:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
with you uh representative Mullen uh I
 
06:04:59.468 --> 06:04:59.478 align:start position:0%
do like that last sentence very much
 
06:05:02.788 --> 06:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
myself um it's it's critical so thank
 
06:05:03.990 --> 06:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
you very
 
06:05:06.910 --> 06:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
much okay I do not see any other
 
06:05:08.990 --> 06:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
Representatives with questions but I do
 
06:05:12.990 --> 06:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
see uh the um representative from uh the
 
06:05:16.590 --> 06:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education Melissa white
 
06:05:21.070 --> 06:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:23.830 --> 06:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
up yeah go ahead Melissa I know she was
 
06:05:26.310 --> 06:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
coming great thank you um I just wanted
 
06:05:28.230 --> 06:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
to make myself a available to answer any
 
06:05:30.468 --> 06:05:30.478 align:start position:0%
questions about the assessment system or
 
06:05:33.270 --> 06:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
the uh student uh reports that are
 
06:05:35.788 --> 06:05:35.798 align:start position:0%
available for parents um just to clarify
 
06:05:37.788 --> 06:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire SAS our testing
 
06:05:40.390 --> 06:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
window usually begins in the middle of
 
06:05:42.868 --> 06:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
March and it goes all the way until
 
06:05:44.310 --> 06:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
about the middle of June so for this
 
06:05:46.110 --> 06:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
year for example I believe it begins
 
06:05:49.590 --> 06:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
March 8th and will end June 11th this
 
06:05:52.030 --> 06:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
report that is available for parents
 
06:05:53.830 --> 06:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's a parent uh we call it an
 
06:05:56.230 --> 06:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
individual student report it's a report
 
06:05:58.590 --> 06:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
that is created specifically for parents
 
06:06:00.510 --> 06:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
in a language that they can understand
 
06:06:02.830 --> 06:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
using terms that they can understand
 
06:06:04.948 --> 06:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
this report is immediately generated
 
06:06:06.868 --> 06:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
once the student finishes the assessment
 
06:06:08.670 --> 06:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
so the moment the student finishes their
 
06:06:11.150 --> 06:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
assessment for math their score is
 
06:06:12.430 --> 06:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
generated when they finish their
 
06:06:14.990 --> 06:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
assessment for ELA it's generated and
 
06:06:19.150 --> 06:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
then this one report will include their
 
06:06:23.750 --> 06:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
um scores for Math and for ELA and if
 
06:06:26.070 --> 06:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
they have taken a previous assessment
 
06:06:27.990 --> 06:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps in another a previous grade
 
06:06:31.350 --> 06:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
level it'll also include the growth from
 
06:06:33.590 --> 06:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
that specific test until the one they
 
06:06:37.350 --> 06:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
have just taken so with the test uh re
 
06:06:39.910 --> 06:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
reports being available the moment the
 
06:06:42.030 --> 06:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
student finishes the assessment so for
 
06:06:43.670 --> 06:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
example if they finished it let's say
 
06:06:45.750 --> 06:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
March 30th it's going to be available
 
06:06:47.670 --> 06:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
March 30th and can be sent to parents
 
06:06:50.230 --> 06:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
the moment that it's finished that it's
 
06:06:52.708 --> 06:06:52.718 align:start position:0%
generated in a PDF form so it can be
 
06:06:54.670 --> 06:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
emailed to parents or it could be
 
06:06:56.670 --> 06:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
printed out and also sent home with a
 
06:06:59.670 --> 06:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
student or could be sent home um by the
 
06:07:02.670 --> 06:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
school but the anybody in the district
 
06:07:06.110 --> 06:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
that has access to that report for
 
06:07:09.150 --> 06:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
students it could be a test coordinator
 
06:07:11.110 --> 06:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
a test administrator a teacher a
 
06:07:13.270 --> 06:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
principal they all have access in the
 
06:07:15.590 --> 06:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
ability to provide those individual
 
06:07:19.030 --> 06:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
reports to parents the SAT is a little
 
06:07:21.510 --> 06:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
bit different in that it the um tests
 
06:07:25.030 --> 06:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
usually happen March and April and then
 
06:07:27.350 --> 06:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
the scores are available definitely
 
06:07:29.270 --> 06:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
before June 30th but they're not
 
06:07:30.910 --> 06:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
available the moment the student
 
06:07:32.750 --> 06:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
finishes the test so just to clarify
 
06:07:35.548 --> 06:07:35.558 align:start position:0%
that with the New Hampshire SAS for ELA
 
06:07:37.628 --> 06:07:37.638 align:start position:0%
math and science that score is
 
06:07:40.430 --> 06:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
immediately available when the student
 
06:07:45.350 --> 06:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
finishes Mr chair yes represent Miler a
 
06:07:49.190 --> 06:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
question uh Miss White is there a uh is
 
06:07:52.310 --> 06:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
there a portal with which the parent can
 
06:07:54.708 --> 06:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
also get this information is it put into
 
06:07:57.590 --> 06:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
a parental portal so at this time we do
 
06:07:59.590 --> 06:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
not have a specific Parent Portal that's
 
06:08:01.310 --> 06:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
available that but that we are working
 
06:08:03.628 --> 06:08:03.638 align:start position:0%
on developing that with our uh cambam
 
06:08:05.270 --> 06:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
assessments which is our vendor for our
 
06:08:08.190 --> 06:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
assessment system so that at that point
 
06:08:09.788 --> 06:08:09.798 align:start position:0%
parents would just have the ability to
 
06:08:11.230 --> 06:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
Pro you know give the school permission
 
06:08:13.390 --> 06:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
the school can provide an and an email
 
06:08:15.788 --> 06:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
for that student and then uh it can
 
06:08:17.548 --> 06:08:17.558 align:start position:0%
immediately be sent but at this time we
 
06:08:19.150 --> 06:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
don't have the parent portal option but
 
06:08:21.510 --> 06:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
we are working on making that available
 
06:08:24.868 --> 06:08:24.878 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible as as a followup Mr
 
06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
chair go ahead I'm I'm now chairing I
 
06:08:31.350 --> 06:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
know okay the the I I don't mean to go
 
06:08:34.628 --> 06:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
back to 194 that we looked at before but
 
06:08:38.190 --> 06:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
is there is there a way with which uh
 
06:08:41.070 --> 06:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
Miss White that the department is
 
06:08:43.788 --> 06:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
contemplating Gathering the names of
 
06:08:45.750 --> 06:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
parents Etc so that this could be sent
 
06:08:45.760 --> 06:08:46.708 align:start position:0%
parents Etc so that this could be sent
out

06:08:46.708 --> 06:08:46.718 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:08:48.868 --> 06:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
immediately so at this time we don't
 
06:08:51.548 --> 06:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
have the ability to gather up the names
 
06:08:52.990 --> 06:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
the and we have you know have parents
 
06:08:54.628 --> 06:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
request that we don't have that ability
 
06:08:57.750 --> 06:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
to do that internally no but with the
 
06:08:59.070 --> 06:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
development of this Parent Portal
 
06:09:00.948 --> 06:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
through our our assessment system then
 
06:09:02.430 --> 06:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
you know we'd be able to you know just
 
06:09:03.910 --> 06:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
provide that to parents and they could
 
06:09:05.590 --> 06:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
access it but at this time we don't have
 
06:09:07.708 --> 06:09:07.718 align:start position:0%
that capability because one of the
 
06:09:09.350 --> 06:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
issues that this committee has dealt
 
06:09:11.190 --> 06:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
with on an ongoing basis the whole issue
 
06:09:14.990 --> 06:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
of security and names Etc and so that
 
06:09:17.430 --> 06:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
would be one of the concerns I think 194
 
06:09:19.070 --> 06:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
would have to address too so thank you
 
06:09:19.080 --> 06:09:20.468 align:start position:0%
would have to address too so thank you
very

06:09:20.468 --> 06:09:20.478 align:start position:0%
very
 
06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
much are there any other questions uh or
 
06:09:30.190 --> 06:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:34.430 --> 06:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
speaker can I also askes Mullen go ahead
 
06:09:36.910 --> 06:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh so representative lad just as a
 
06:09:39.310 --> 06:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
followup to your testimony while Melissa
 
06:09:43.310 --> 06:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
is still here um what happens what
 
06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
happens to a school that doesn't get
 
06:09:49.510 --> 06:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
their reports out by June 30 like who's
 
06:09:52.868 --> 06:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
going to track that information how are
 
06:09:55.270 --> 06:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
you going to know who didn't get the
 
06:09:57.750 --> 06:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
reports out and and what's the what's
 
06:09:57.760 --> 06:09:59.110 align:start position:0%
reports out and and what's the what's
the

06:09:59.110 --> 06:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:10:01.150 --> 06:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
consequence you want to share it right
 
06:10:03.310 --> 06:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
now while I
 
06:10:06.788 --> 06:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
so oh no no okay would you like take
 
06:10:08.868 --> 06:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll take the question from Ron
 
06:10:08.878 --> 06:10:10.590 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll take the question from Ron
Mullen

06:10:10.590 --> 06:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
Mullen
 
06:10:10.600 --> 06:10:12.270 align:start position:0%
Mullen
um

06:10:12.270 --> 06:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:16.030 --> 06:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
the there really isn't a way to catch
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
this right now it's we hear about this
 
06:10:20.788 --> 06:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
when the parents saying I just didn't
 
06:10:23.788 --> 06:10:23.798 align:start position:0%
didn't get anything
 
06:10:27.190 --> 06:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
um you H something that we all all have
 
06:10:29.628 --> 06:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
to be thinking about
 
06:10:32.628 --> 06:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
accountability and oversight on all
 
06:10:35.990 --> 06:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
these programs we have this the doe is
 
06:10:38.548 --> 06:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
really limited with staff when you have
 
06:10:41.310 --> 06:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
just one individual maybe in testing and
 
06:10:43.590 --> 06:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
and couple people in finance we're
 
06:10:46.628 --> 06:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
shallow and so I I think what the the
 
06:10:48.468 --> 06:10:48.478 align:start position:0%
oversight really has to come from the
 
06:10:51.070 --> 06:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
district um we have leadership in the
 
06:10:53.150 --> 06:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
district uh we have principles in the
 
06:10:56.190 --> 06:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
district um and I think that leadership
 
06:10:58.030 --> 06:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
and best practice this has to come from
 
06:10:59.948 --> 06:10:59.958 align:start position:0%
the local level I I don't think we need
 
06:11:03.548 --> 06:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
to say to apartment you have another
 
06:11:05.868 --> 06:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
another deal you got to you know take
 
06:11:05.878 --> 06:11:07.708 align:start position:0%
another deal you got to you know take
care

06:11:07.708 --> 06:11:07.718 align:start position:0%
care
 
06:11:14.030 --> 06:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:14.040 --> 06:11:17.468 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:11:17.468 --> 06:11:17.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:20.310 --> 06:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
Corell I think Melissa said that the
 
06:11:23.510 --> 06:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
testing window in some districts went
 
06:11:27.310 --> 06:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
right through the middle of June so
 
06:11:30.590 --> 06:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
that would if there are a number of
 
06:11:33.788 --> 06:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
those schools or districts where they're
 
06:11:35.868 --> 06:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
still testing in June they won't get
 
06:11:38.948 --> 06:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
their test results back before the end
 
06:11:43.390 --> 06:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:43.400 --> 06:11:44.910 align:start position:0%
 
out

06:11:44.910 --> 06:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:11:48.868 --> 06:11:48.878 align:start position:0%
that's may I please clarify yeah so if
 
06:11:50.510 --> 06:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
the end of the testing window the window
 
06:11:52.708 --> 06:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
ends June 11th if the student takes that
 
06:11:54.948 --> 06:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
test on June 11th their score is
 
06:11:57.750 --> 06:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
generated June 11th so the teacher or
 
06:11:59.430 --> 06:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
test administrator has the ability to
 
06:12:06.070 --> 06:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:06.080 --> 06:12:08.788 align:start position:0%
 
11th

06:12:08.788 --> 06:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
11th
 
06:12:11.628 --> 06:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
okay are we are done the questions me
 
06:12:13.390 --> 06:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
can I take over
 
06:12:17.350 --> 06:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
again for whom last
 
06:12:20.310 --> 06:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
Lady okay we we have representative leus
 
06:12:23.310 --> 06:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
would like to talk to Melissa about the
 
06:12:26.708 --> 06:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
uh Melissa white are you still there yes
 
06:12:29.110 --> 06:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
sir okay we have a representative on the
 
06:12:31.510 --> 06:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh Alicia like us would like
 
06:12:32.910 --> 06:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
to ask you a
 
06:12:35.270 --> 06:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
06:12:38.070 --> 06:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
question um I'm just trying to
 
06:12:40.628 --> 06:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
understand so when the test is done the
 
06:12:44.070 --> 06:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
results are there what then is happening
 
06:12:47.390 --> 06:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
at this point between the results are
 
06:12:49.868 --> 06:12:49.878 align:start position:0%
there the school having the results and
 
06:12:52.230 --> 06:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
the parents are having results what what
 
06:12:54.510 --> 06:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
is actually happening and what is
 
06:12:57.628 --> 06:12:57.638 align:start position:0%
causing the delay
 
06:12:59.910 --> 06:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure um what that might be on
 
06:13:02.750 --> 06:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
the school end but you know I myself uh
 
06:13:05.150 --> 06:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
was recently a classroom teacher and so
 
06:13:07.390 --> 06:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
I would have that report I could look at
 
06:13:10.190 --> 06:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
that report I could save it as a PDF and
 
06:13:12.190 --> 06:13:12.200 align:start position:0%
immediately email it to a
 
06:13:15.190 --> 06:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
parent the moment this that the student
 
06:13:16.910 --> 06:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
has finished the
 
06:13:19.548 --> 06:13:19.558 align:start position:0%
assessment thank you if if I chose to
 
06:13:21.070 --> 06:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
print it out I could just print it out
 
06:13:22.510 --> 06:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
and then send it home with the student
 
06:13:22.520 --> 06:13:24.948 align:start position:0%
and then send it home with the student
as

06:13:24.948 --> 06:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:27.468 --> 06:13:27.478 align:start position:0%
well so you could
 
06:13:30.350 --> 06:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
do so you could do that the very same
 
06:13:32.670 --> 06:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
day that the test was done you as a
 
06:13:39.150 --> 06:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:41.990 --> 06:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
you are there F further
 
06:13:44.868 --> 06:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
questions I see a hand up in the
 
06:13:50.788 --> 06:13:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:55.270 --> 06:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:55.280 --> 06:14:10.430 align:start position:0%
 
Oliver

06:14:10.430 --> 06:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:12.628 --> 06:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
can you tell what's going on Deb still
 
06:14:15.590 --> 06:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
muted it looks like you're still muted
 
06:14:18.628 --> 06:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
06:14:24.390 --> 06:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
Ford okay now go good thank you uh thank
 
06:14:26.990 --> 06:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question many of us in
 
06:14:28.628 --> 06:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
this conversation have been in the
 
06:14:32.030 --> 06:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
classroom some of us at various levels
 
06:14:34.708 --> 06:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
and we've also been administrators what
 
06:14:37.390 --> 06:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
concerns me about this is that we're
 
06:14:39.990 --> 06:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
06:14:42.788 --> 06:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
information that is basically put on a
 
06:14:46.150 --> 06:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
shelf and not used and we're all aware
 
06:14:50.270 --> 06:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
of how kids are losing uh progress
 
06:14:52.868 --> 06:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
achievement over the coid problem of
 
06:14:55.310 --> 06:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
just that kind of delay and then I hear
 
06:14:57.510 --> 06:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
talking us talking about we've got to
 
06:14:59.830 --> 06:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
get the information and we don't act on
 
06:15:03.468 --> 06:15:03.478 align:start position:0%
it until next September and I'm thinking
 
06:15:06.910 --> 06:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
as I hear that why are we doing that why
 
06:15:10.830 --> 06:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
don't we link perhaps some of the remedy
 
06:15:12.990 --> 06:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
to getting the information and tie it
 
06:15:15.468 --> 06:15:15.478 align:start position:0%
closer together and look at this as a
 
06:15:17.628 --> 06:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
two-step thing rather than a one-step
 
06:15:20.350 --> 06:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
thing and just think about it because we
 
06:15:23.070 --> 06:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
know that most kids learn to read within
 
06:15:25.628 --> 06:15:25.638 align:start position:0%
certain age groups they learn to do math
 
06:15:27.510 --> 06:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
within certain certain other age groups
 
06:15:29.708 --> 06:15:29.718 align:start position:0%
this is something we all know then why
 
06:15:32.948 --> 06:15:32.958 align:start position:0%
not say do a concentration on reading in
 
06:15:35.468 --> 06:15:35.478 align:start position:0%
the summer or on math in the summer and
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
Link that to these data that we get and
 
06:15:41.150 --> 06:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
work toward the solution so that when
 
06:15:43.390 --> 06:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
they come back in September they haven't
 
06:15:46.070 --> 06:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
slid backwards they've moved
 
06:15:49.390 --> 06:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
ahead so I'm just thinking that maybe
 
06:15:53.430 --> 06:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:58.230 --> 06:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:00.750 --> 06:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
well I I can I can respond and it's you
 
06:16:04.708 --> 06:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
know just not uh as chairman now I'm
 
06:16:08.468 --> 06:16:08.478 align:start position:0%
away from that bill but I think that um
 
06:16:11.868 --> 06:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a parent also
 
06:16:15.628 --> 06:16:15.638 align:start position:0%
assisting and teaching too and I concur
 
06:16:17.868 --> 06:16:17.878 align:start position:0%
we're all in this together and you have
 
06:16:19.948 --> 06:16:19.958 align:start position:0%
these opportunities you let two or three
 
06:16:22.190 --> 06:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
months pass you're letting you know a
 
06:16:25.788 --> 06:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
quarter of the year pass you by and in
 
06:16:28.430 --> 06:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
term terms of the lifespan of a student
 
06:16:28.440 --> 06:16:29.230 align:start position:0%
term terms of the lifespan of a student
in

06:16:29.230 --> 06:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:16:31.948 --> 06:16:31.958 align:start position:0%
school we can't afford to do
 
06:16:37.910 --> 06:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
that so I I I I I think this this bill
 
06:16:40.030 --> 06:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
has a lot of wonderful merits in it
 
06:16:41.590 --> 06:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
we're just going to have to work to try
 
06:16:44.070 --> 06:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
and figure out how to get it the way we
 
06:16:47.670 --> 06:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
feel we should I appreciate Melissa
 
06:16:50.628 --> 06:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
White's comments and information um
 
06:16:52.070 --> 06:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
Melissa do you have anything else to
 
06:16:54.510 --> 06:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
offer us right
 
06:16:57.190 --> 06:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
now um no I don't think so but I'm
 
06:16:59.548 --> 06:16:59.558 align:start position:0%
available for any questions thank you so
 
06:17:01.030 --> 06:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
I think what we're going to do is now go
 
06:17:03.670 --> 06:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
on to other presenter because we one
 
06:17:05.548 --> 06:17:05.558 align:start position:0%
presenter left and then we're done with
 
06:17:09.350 --> 06:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
this bill uh we're done for the day so
 
06:17:11.350 --> 06:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
um who do we have on the I think we're
 
06:17:12.990 --> 06:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
all done oh we're all done we're all
 
06:17:16.590 --> 06:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
done then so um if there's no more
 
06:17:20.510 --> 06:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
questions and I don't see any
 
06:17:24.430 --> 06:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
hands good and no hands here either so
 
06:17:27.310 --> 06:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the hearing for 194
 
06:17:27.320 --> 06:17:28.750 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the hearing for 194
and

06:17:28.750 --> 06:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:17:33.548 --> 06:17:33.558 align:start position:0%
323 and call it a day here we are now um
 
06:17:37.390 --> 06:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
done our docket uh some words of advice
 
06:17:39.948 --> 06:17:39.958 align:start position:0%
for everybody set aside Tuesday and
 
06:17:41.628 --> 06:17:41.638 align:start position:0%
Thursday of next week and of the
 
06:17:44.350 --> 06:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
following week the calendar will be out

sometime on on hopefully thereafter
 
06:17:58.868 --> 06:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
Thursday I'm not going to guarantee um
 
06:18:01.150 --> 06:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
but that's the clerk's office business
 
06:18:04.868 --> 06:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
so um are there any comments now uh it's
 
06:18:06.868 --> 06:18:06.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity for some feedback from those
 
06:18:09.948 --> 06:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
that are online or or from the room
 
06:18:09.958 --> 06:18:11.510 align:start position:0%
that are online or or from the room
right

06:18:11.510 --> 06:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:18:15.230 --> 06:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
here I just want to tell okay we have
 
06:18:18.868 --> 06:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
okay uh uh representa Woodcock just a
 
06:18:21.868 --> 06:18:21.878 align:start position:0%
quick one representa lad thank you um is
 
06:18:24.910 --> 06:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
being home on Zoom depending on who is
 
06:18:28.468 --> 06:18:28.478 align:start position:0%
speaking uh in the L some we heard very
 
06:18:31.230 --> 06:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
clearly and some faded away represent C
 
06:18:33.030 --> 06:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
was a great example at some point I
 
06:18:34.310 --> 06:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if he moved he closer to the
 
06:18:36.310 --> 06:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
mic whatever it was he came through loud
 
06:18:38.150 --> 06:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
and clear but when he's starting his
 
06:18:40.030 --> 06:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
opening and stuff was really really hear
 
06:18:42.270 --> 06:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
it so I don't know if that's a tech
 
06:18:44.468 --> 06:18:44.478 align:start position:0%
technical piece down there up here just
 
06:18:45.270 --> 06:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
just the
 
06:18:49.030 --> 06:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
FYI just if I could the the microphones
 
06:18:52.270 --> 06:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
are actually on tables in front of
 
06:18:56.750 --> 06:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
us um so you know I guess sit up as
 
06:19:02.750 --> 06:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
close as we can um in our desk area um
 
06:19:05.430 --> 06:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
but that's where the microphones are so
 
06:19:08.310 --> 06:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
they're good six feet from
 
06:19:12.990 --> 06:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
us when we started today earlier um we
 
06:19:15.190 --> 06:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
started a little bit late because we had
 
06:19:17.788 --> 06:19:17.798 align:start position:0%
for folks from uh technical side
 
06:19:19.628 --> 06:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
computers coming in here and juggling
 
06:19:22.670 --> 06:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
these mics around moving them around and
 
06:19:26.548 --> 06:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
so um perhaps what we'll do next time is
 
06:19:28.670 --> 06:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure we're in here early turn
 
06:19:31.230 --> 06:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
this system on and try to see if we can
 
06:19:33.510 --> 06:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know zoom in from another location
 
06:19:36.070 --> 06:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
to building if things are clear and can
 
06:19:39.868 --> 06:19:39.878 align:start position:0%
be heard um but I think for our first
 
06:19:43.868 --> 06:19:43.878 align:start position:0%
time we were we got to our bills and um
 
06:19:47.070 --> 06:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
I appreciate everybody's sitting tight I
 
06:19:48.670 --> 06:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
envy some of you at home where you can
 
06:19:50.590 --> 06:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
go raid the refrigerator when you want
 
06:19:54.110 --> 06:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
to um here there's
