00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
quarterly Capital project report for
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
quarter ending December 17th I'm sorry
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
December 31st
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
2023 and who's going to uh lead on that
 
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
information Mr sh so typically the
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't have anybody speak to
 
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
this quar report um so it's just
 
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
informational and if there's any
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
questions you can give them to me and
 
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
then I can follow up with the Department
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
fabulous that's why I'm on a roll
 
00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:29.079 align:start position:0%
representative Wier sorry to slow it
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
down oh okay I'm comparing
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
24004 to
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
24001 and I'm looking at projects that
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
have been going on forever like the
 
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
dairy London Dairy 193 exit
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
4A project
 
00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:49.079 align:start position:0%
13065 and I noted it in the February it
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
was like at
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
59,000 then it goes to 64,000 in the in
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
the latest one that's quite a change as
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
well as the one that went from 33 to 36
 
00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:01.990 align:start position:0%
well as the one that went from 33 to 36
the

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.470 align:start position:0%
the
1306

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
1306
 
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.230 align:start position:0%
1306
1306b

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
1306b
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
1365b so it's I'm wondering about if
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to be typical of all the
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
projects and if we're going to be able
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
to afford to are those just would those
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
just be quarterly
 
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
expenditures so the agencies provide
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
information to administrative Services
 
00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:24.519 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the activity on the
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
projects so there may be update on the
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
expenses that they've incurred from from
 
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
one quarter to the next the
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
Appropriations don't change though so
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
the projects have been appropriated X
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
dollar through a capital project House
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 25 or through a in Do's example
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
through the budget um what they show you
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
typically is what they encumber and what
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
they've expended and what a balance
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
forward is in the
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
report but I can get more detail if you
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
would like represent wer on those couple
 
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
projects it seemed like that was the
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation and those projects have
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
been going on forever
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
so so in the quarterly report the
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
appropriation the original appropriation
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
goes away after the first quarter so the
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
the number isn't carried forward in this
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
report that's something that the
 
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services I
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
have talked about um when the first year
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
of the capital budget is included you'll
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
see the appropriation amount but after
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
that they just show you what's remaining
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
and then what they've expended so keeps
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
decreasing you spend a couple of bucks
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
to mail me all this stuff so I thought I
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
should look it over a little bit thank
 
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
you but I can certainly get answers to
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
any specific questions I can talk with
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
you offline if you'd like
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
y all right then in as regards to that I
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
guess we are also covering at the same
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%

like to ah
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
okay you're up then good morning
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
everybody uh Thea Stewart commissioner
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Natural and
 
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.269 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Natural and
cultural

00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
resources and the tram uh represents
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
both the natural and the cultural part
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
of our agency um I'm going to speak for
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
a second and then I brought people who
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
are way smarter about the technical
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
aspects of this really big project um
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to just start by saying
 
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
this is uh we're now in year four of of
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
talking about the future of the tram um
 
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
and we've we've landed at um what we
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
thought was a successful um amount of 18
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
million um and went out to bid and that
 
00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:22.519 align:start position:0%
was not enough which is a story you've
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
heard many times I think uh in this room
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
um and so we we need to sort of go back
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
to our corners and and figure out what
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
to do to move this forward um assuming
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire would like to
 
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
see the tram um reinstated in and in
 
00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
place for the next 40 years um the
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
legislative uh decisionmakers in 1978 79
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
decided to invest in the tram um and now
 
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
it's your turn to deliberate on this um
 
00:13:58.749 --> 00:13:58.759 align:start position:0%
iconic New Hampshire experience um and
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
before I I turn it over or let you ask
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
specific questions um it's really
 
00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:05.959 align:start position:0%
important to the uh the makeup of the
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
state park system as you um all know the
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
state park system in New Hampshire is
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
operationally self-funded which is a
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
unique way for any state to run their
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
state parks and it works really well for
 
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
us um we are charged by RSA to run like
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
a business and the tram is one of our
 
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
largest uh single funders of our Park
 
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
system uh and so for us um not only is
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
it a wonderful experience to offer at
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
frankone not State Park but it's really
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
important to um to provide that funding
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
to state parks that don't raise enough
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
money to self- sustain um and so with
 
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
that you all have the letter that I that
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
I drafted to summarize uh the process um
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
I'll be quiet I'll entertain questions
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
and call up um uh phone a friend as
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
guys I'm sorry first off any questions
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative wer thank you Mr chair I
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
say that it it says $1.8 million a year
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
in Revenue so what does it cost to ride
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
when was the last time it was
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
increased uh and obviously if it's if
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's been 40 years since we invested
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
that money of of 20 million and and uh
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
now or less than that and now it's paid
 
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
for itself and more so can we go up in
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
the in the ride price and you know so
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
that it'll pay for itself again thank
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
you great question I'll turn to Brian
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
Wilson who's our Park
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
director um so um it's been about uh a
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
little over a year since the last
 
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
incremental change uh for the tram ride
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
it's about uh $20 per person uh for for
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
a roundtrip and um it is the the fee is
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
set as part of our uh within our fee
 
00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
package within the state park system uh
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
that would uh be a recommendation that
 
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:24.759 align:start position:0%
comes forward through the commissioner
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh to the fiscal committee so uh in our
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
last Fe
 
00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
um update we opted to not increase uh
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
the rate or to propose an increase to
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
the rate um and um there was a few other
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
areas within the fee uh package as well
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
too like the the The Flume Gorge uh
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
relative to frankonia notch where we we
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
rates that that said representative um I
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
I think I think if we are confident that
 
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to have resources to put a
 
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
shiny new tram in in in its place and
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
have a big ribbon cutting and uh and a
 
00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
hoopla I think that would be the time to
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate the the ticket prices and uh
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
and per RSA we are supposed to be in
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
line with with the market value and I
 
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
think we would have room to tick it up a
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
bit if I might Senator reeners please uh
 
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
good morning thanks for being here um
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
quick question 1.8 million in Revenue
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
profitability um that fluctuates really
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
year to year depending on what uh some
 
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
of the costs that are going into the
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance but generally relative it uh
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
generates uh a net revenue of over a
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
questions uh so the only one I have is I
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
know that so we have the state
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
legislature we've already authorized $18
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
million on this and your first and only
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
bid came in at 33.3
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
million so it's up to us to uh looking
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
for capital budget request of an
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
additional $15 million
 
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
correct okay any other information
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
us um short of additional funding we as
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner said we we are kind of
 
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
back at the uh kind of square one back
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
at the drawing board we are uh working
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
with uh the lyt companies that we have
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
have worked with and that we're looking
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
at this particular project uh to examine
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
some Alternatives I I I guess I'll say
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
in in sort of a soft estimate costs um
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
the this this process that we went
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
through uh for the design uh build um
 
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
resulted in the outcome that we got with
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
which was just one bid and we were
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
hopeful to receive more than one uh the
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
other manufacturer and uh lift provider
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
had uh instead of submitting a bid to us
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
provided us a memo with uh some you know
 
00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
the the reasons why they didn't submit a
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
bit and some questions and some concerns
 
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
about our the process that we went about
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
so we're kind of taking that information
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
and and hoping to kind of give this give
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
this another go uh our concern
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
really lies in um it it'll take us some
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
considerable time probably upwards of
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
another year I think to um come out of
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
the other end of another bidding process
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
um so um with our the recent um
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
submission of our agency's uh capital
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
budget request we wanted to make sure
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
that that U additional $15 million was
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
was put out there uh for for everyone's
 
00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
awareness um because we won't know
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
whether 18 is going to really work or
 
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
not uh for for for some time here now um
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it was uh disappointing to
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
say the least for us to kind of go
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
through the whole process over the last
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
year and a half to come out with that
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
outcome but we're not we're sharpening
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
trying I'm sorry Senator n did you have
 
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you it may be in the in the
 
00:20:24.669 --> 00:20:24.679 align:start position:0%
letter and I missed it um how many
 
00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:26.919 align:start position:0%
writers per year I'm coming up with
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
about 990,000 based on the number
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
numbers you've
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
shared is that
 
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
accurate um we we do I I'll will have to
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
I can provide that information we do
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
keep keep detailed uh attendance records
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh so I'd have to get that for you okay
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'm having fun with math and thinking
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
well you know if you add $5 to the
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
ticket price on that number of riders
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
know that's an extra 450,000 a year
 
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
assuming there's no decline in writers
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
ship and maybe we can find a way to
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
finance out of future revenues or
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
something like that okay thank
 
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
you representative evil thank you thank
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so um at some point you
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
really start to lose functionality I
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
guess of the tram and it sounds like
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
we're rapidly approaching that point and
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
I mean could you just talk a little bit
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
about stop Gap measures how much longer
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
they're likely to work just an overall
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
picture thanks uh no problem I'll turn
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
that over to Brian too but uh we do
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
inspect it
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
daily uh safety
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
first um yeah we've been uh essentially
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
put on notice from the the the
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that uh certain components
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
are you know ex uh approaching their end
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
of life and because of uh it being a
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
over 40-year-old system uh some of those
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
parts are not going to be replaceable or
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
very easily replaceable uh so uh
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
essentially it has been determined that
 
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
it is you know at the at the end of its
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
life um we recently had a thirdparty
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
engineering firm come through uh to
 
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
provide uh uh an in-depth assessment of
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
it and and gave us essentially a clean
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
bill of health uh through uh the rest of
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
the summer and this next uh Winter Ski
 
00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:23.799 align:start position:0%
season um that said you know we we also
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
have heard from the manufacturer that
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know this system isn't something
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
that um that can just continue to to to
 
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
operate without some plan of you know
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
what the next phase is whether that's
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
decommissioning or um you know a
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
construction of of of a new system uh so
 
00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
um we would like to be able to plan for
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
that and and phase any construction in
 
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
to the best of our ability within our
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
operation to help mitigate any loss of
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh to to the greatest extent as
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
well too so that's that's really
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
important for us to have uh any downtime
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
be minimized to the to to to the
 
00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:06.190 align:start position:0%
be minimized to the to to to the
greatest

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
greatest
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
extent follow I I remember some
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
discussion about this this was not
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
funding um it it may have been eligible
 
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
by eligibility standards but we were we
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
at this point I would like to turn the
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
meeting back over to Chairman mononi
 
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.710 align:start position:0%
meeting back over to Chairman mononi
thank

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you and I apologize for my
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
tardiness um and I would like to catch
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
up on this
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
conversation um is there more to the
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
presentation that questions from from
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
the committee we're just answering
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
questions right now so and so and I
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
apologize for being late I honestly do
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
so if if I understand correctly the
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
amount of funds that are needed now to
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
move forward with the project we're at
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
about halfway with that uh we're looking
 
00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:09.799 align:start position:0%
at potentially 15 million
 
00:24:09.799 --> 00:24:11.909 align:start position:0%
at potentially 15 million
additional

00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
dollars okay all right no no further
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
questions yes please it's it's nearly a
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
doubling but I think the problem is
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
there's a limited number of trams and a
 
00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
very limited number of people that build
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
them I don't know how many comp
 
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
companies there are but they kind of
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
have a monopoly here and we're kind of
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
stuck with it but it is a it is a uh
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
Revenue generat we can't Overlook that
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
and uh you know and if things go well
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
and we should be able to pay for it
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
within a few years and even have money
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
to spare I'm in favor of of spending
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
whatever it is to take care of this is
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
probably the only one of the few trams
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
in New England thank you thank you R wer
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
yes please repr so just a followup
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I understand you're directed not to
 
00:25:09.389 --> 00:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
ask for ARA funds and the LBA may be
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
able to assist maybe not my
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is there's a reasonable
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
trunch of money left at the moment that
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
still has not been obligated and needs
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
to be obligated or we lose it um do we
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
know how much money that is and has
 
00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:29.559 align:start position:0%
anyone gone back to make a second
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
ask thank you um I do not know how much
 
00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:36.039 align:start position:0%
more money there is we report regularly
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
to the Gopher team um and they have they
 
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
have not been in a position to tell us
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
how much money there is I know that
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
they're getting requests
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
hourly um and so you know
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
if if that's an option I think that
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell would need to be
 
00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.909 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell would need to be
talked

00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%
talked
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
to about this R Wilder uh we ran into
 
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
this Opera funding on another project if
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
the construction isn't finished by the
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
end of 2026 you can't ask for the money
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
and obviously this won't qualify on
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
those grounds so I don't think we should
 
00:26:17.789 --> 00:26:17.799 align:start position:0%
pursue that because there's no way this
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
is going to be finished by the end of
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
2026 so especially when we're spending
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
all this time getting the bid thank you
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator gray uh that's not
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
necessary L true from what I hear okay
 
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh like the Strafford County nursing
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
home what they were going to do is pay
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
for a particular portion of that and
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
that was the foundation and the
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
engineering work that needed to happen
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
before so again the this project could
 
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
be broken up into smaller pieces and
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
then those smaller pieces but again you
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of people out there
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
looking for those dollars so I don't
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
offer you much hope right now
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
thank thank you sandor um I just I'd
 
00:27:05.389 --> 00:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
like to add one and then a comment on a
 
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
subject matter that's coming afterwards
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
in the our next meeting uh I was just in
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh New Mexico with my family graduation
 
00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
couple three weeks ago Albuquerque and
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
we're right next to the Sandia Mountains
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure you folks are
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
familiar um that they have the largest
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
tram uh in uh North America there that
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
was just refurbished
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't think I got a family member
 
00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:33.799 align:start position:0%
on that for the ride up to the top up to
 
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
10,000 ft for less than than $40 a
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
person if I remember right uh can you
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
just refresh my mind what sort of money
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the summer we charge per person to go
 
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
up Canon Mountain so I I answered that
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
before you came in but I uh I want to
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
update theod it's
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
$28 um is is the current uh emission
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
price and we in our last fee um uh fee
 
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
package proposal we opted to not uh
 
00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
recommend an increase to that at at this
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
time uh although we do think that
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
there's additional um um ability to
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
increase that with with a new and
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
refreshed uh model uh and again most of
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
our visitation uh is is really happening
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
during the the the spring summer fall
 
00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:23.519 align:start position:0%
months uh so that's that's where we
 
00:28:26.669 --> 00:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
really see our our Revenue Peak for it's
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's really the summer visitation
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
um so I think that there is some options
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
there to um help either increase the
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
revenue for uh the park fund or in the
 
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519 align:start position:0%
past I believe also a portion of uh the
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
costs attributed with Capital
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
Improvements to the tram have have been
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
bonded uh with a uh stipulation that uh
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
that is paid is paid for in part through
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
the revenues that have come in as well
 
00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:56.519 align:start position:0%
too so thank you I appreciate those
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
comments um I also have weekends with
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
the family and friends and one of the
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
people I work with from Storyland and
 
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
their admission rate for a day is $75
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
skiing is1 $200 a day um I think you
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
need to aggressively look at what that
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
pricing is going to be from this one
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
person's point of view this is a massive
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
amount of money for something and we
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be thinking shortterm we
 
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
should be thinking long term I apologize
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
for the would you believe uh my my
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
second for the commissioner and thank
 
00:29:33.149 --> 00:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
you again for being here and I don't
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
know you'll be here later so I just want
 
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
to comment appreciate your work on the
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
uh State Park Properties with the
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
amateur radio I think we're getting
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
close it might need a little push from
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
you um and lastly I believe we have an
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
item in here that we're coming up to
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
about the selling of a piece of land
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
that was deemed by your group as not
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
being essential
 
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
um it's it's in here that would be for
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
long range the next meeting yes yeah
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I meant I wasn't
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
looking for your comment but I did have
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
a conversation with your department
 
00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:11.799 align:start position:0%
about a parcel in oopy that's connected
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the boat ramp that leads to

about taking some of that excess
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
property for fish and game back there so

if we could talk about that at another
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
time perhaps we can talk about that um
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
at Bobby
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%

assistant commissioner uh Adam kpo and
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
behind me someplace there he is uh is a
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
Phil Trowbridge who runs our lrm section
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
which is Alter alteration of terrain
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
which is storm water uh Wetlands
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
Shoreland and septic I think that's all
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
the that's enough he says
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so so real quickly uh so um I just
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate uh from my office that
 
00:32:20.629 --> 00:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh e permitting getting getting our uh
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of Permitting in the uh the
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
department uh getting those online
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
available to the public
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh is not only essential for the
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
efficiency for for the practitioners out
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
there who who use our uh Permitting
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
Services uh and just our uh our data for
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
environmental data uh but also for the

make progress uh beyond that report uh
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
as we should uh with things like uh
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
online forms as I mentioned electronic
 
00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:00.039 align:start position:0%
payment um and digitizing of historical
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
records those are some of the highlights
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh I uh our assistant commissioner is
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%

questions thank you as always great uh
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
great tea up from the commissioner um so
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
as he mentioned in April we provided
 
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
some written updates uh to the committee
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
and you know historically we've had to
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
process our permits by paper um even up
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
until this La the last few years um so
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
this the money that was appropriated to
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
these projects is really bringing us
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
into the 21st century and and doing a
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
lot for our constituents our customers
 
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
um so the the goal is to bring 118 forms
 
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:54.909 align:start position:0%
um so the the goal is to bring 118 forms
and

00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
lrm uh up onto the website for E filing
 
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
and E permitting um so folks can uh file
 
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
from their couch if they would they
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
would like to do so um you know last
 
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
week was a really big milestone in this
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
process we were able to upload um
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
various applications all of our
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
Shoreland forms are online with payment
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
and uh various other forms are are
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
online as well and we're going to be
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
working vigorously over the next uh
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
several years but but certainly next few
 
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
months to get uh our wet a bunch of
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
wetlands forms up and and various other
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
forms onto the website um so that's
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's the update on the eiling piece um
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
digitization of subsurface records uh we
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
were given $2 million to uh or we put $2
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
million out to records Force to process
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
our historical records for subsurface
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
files uh those are AC septic system
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
files between 1967 to present day
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and phase one we're we're
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
anticipating that to be completed in
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
April of
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
2025 um that in phase one that really
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
encompasses the our oldest files that's
 
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
1967 to 1986 and and that that's
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
probably our our I would say it's one of
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
our most helpful initiatives currently
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh for folks to be able to go in online
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
and figure out um for a piece of
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
property maybe they're buying you know
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
what the history of that that uh septic
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
system is and and all the information
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
around it currently they're housed in
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
various physical locations across the
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
department and so it really takes I want
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
to call it an act of Congress but it it
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
takes someone coming in or or calling to
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
initiate the process of finding it and
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
we have actual actual physical cards to
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
go and figure out where it's located
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
within the building so this that'll be a
 
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
really uh helpful initiative and we've
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
already got uh we're able to get
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
14,000 files uh digital files online so
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's great um and then for
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
subsurface designers and installers
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
we're working to allow those folks to
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
renew their credentials by uh December
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
of 2024 we anticipate to uh to have that
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh the ability for folks to renew those
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
up actually well before that I think
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
September is the time frame for that
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
project and so we're pretty good
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
progress on that um and so I I'll turn
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
it over to Phil he's the our subject
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
matter expert on on all of the the land
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
resources management projects uh to add
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
any Clarity or additional detail into
 
00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.390 align:start position:0%
any Clarity or additional detail into
those

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
projects good morning Phil trobridge
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
manager of land resources um not much to
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
add on the presentation but I'll just
 
00:36:57.069 --> 00:36:57.079 align:start position:0%
put some numbers on it uh for the our
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
Shor forms are now 100%
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
online um and our Wetlands forms were at
 
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
13% we anticipate being 100% by the end
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
of the summer so things are moving
 
00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
really fast for us right now with
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
getting the forms online and so far the
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
adoption of these forms has been really
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
quick uh we've put a Complaint Form
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
online this is where people can um let
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
us know about suspected Wetlands
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
violation or something and now 80% of
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
our forms come in all 80% of the form
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
forms are submitted digitally so we we
 
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
expect that early adoption is going to
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
happen rapidly I guess I don't think we
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
can call ourselves early adopters but
 
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
you know we're uh we're getting these
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
things out there and they're being used
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
um I'd say the other other thing that is
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
often lost on this is the efficiency
 
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
gains that we're achieving with our
 
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
internal staff as a result of these
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
forms um the processing of the papers
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
faster not having physical checks to
 
00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:56.839 align:start position:0%
handle having all the files in one place
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
so that as our staff are distributed
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
across different offices they can access
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
them and there's no uh waiting for you
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
know can I get that file from P's
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
questions um same thing for right to no
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
requests it's just a lot easier to do it
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
digitally uh and then on the subsurface
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
digitization project we had three places
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
where we had the files now we only have
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
two we've cleaned one out so um I'd say
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
we're we're starting to make real gains
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
and our our Mantra on this has been you
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
know want people to be able to to file
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
without a printer without a check and
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
without a stamp and we're we're getting
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
there thank you U thank you uh stbridge
 
00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
um commissioner scottt you've assembled
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
a great team it's first time we've had
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh assistant kpo in the in the room
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
today and I appreciate that and to me uh
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
from coming from uh Public Works um this
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
has been money well spent and your eye
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
is on top of this and getting this this
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
information digitized is just phenomenal
 
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
for everyone uh getting Shoreland and
 
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
wetlands dragging them in from the weeds
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
and and getting this online this is
 
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
phenomenal for practitioners which I and
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
my family are so when these documents a
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
question for I don't know which
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
gentleman when these items are are
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
scanned and made digital form are we
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
then removing the old files getting rid
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
of those files
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes we are um we have a a QA step
 
00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
that we go through U we get the we get
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
the files from records Force who's the
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
vendor but then we have three staff
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
inous three temporary staff who are
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
reviewing them making sure the
 
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
information is accurate uh and um and
 
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
then getting it into our database and
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
then those boxes are sent for
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
Destruction sounds good and so will once
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
the subsurface is taken care of will you
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
then start pulling the uh the short land
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
permits and Wetland permits and getting
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
those digitized also or can you get that
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
on a list we we have that on our list
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
and we we do a little bit of that when
 
00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:09.640 align:start position:0%
we have downtime when the vendor is not
 
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
providing us information as fast as we
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
can we we put those staff towards
 
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I appreciate your
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
time the updates great and we'll see you
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
in a few months thank you thank you
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
was that our last item on our our last
 
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:40.710 align:start position:0%
was that our last item on our our last
item

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay I I have always said uh subsurface
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
has just has been on the ball and then
 
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
to find out that uh we're getting the
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
rest of the Departments I think it's
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
so we have um our next meeting will
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
start at 10 o'clock correct so we so we
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of a motion toj U
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
motion to adjourn just before you do
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
that the date of the next meeting will
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
that be at the call of the chair oh what
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
what would your suggestion be I'd say
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
call of the chair okay um reason being
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
since we didn't have any action items
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
today it'd be nice to encourage that to
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
happen full credit for how quickly this
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
meeting you did an amazing job rep s
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
items like nothing that's what we like
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
to hear all right so is there any other
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
business to
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
discuss good
 
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.069 align:start position:0%
discuss good
morning

00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh then U motion's been made in second
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
we're adjourned till our next uh meeting
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
which will be when there's subject
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
matter and in the call of the chair
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very good thank you and we
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
