Good morning, everyone will be opening the hearing on.

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:26.500
144, if you want to please join me in saying the pledge allegiance to the flag.

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:41.000
and to the Republic of which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
All right.

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Well, currently we have nobody here to testify, apparently, from the audience.

14
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.500
Who would like to start the discussion?

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
Anyone?

16
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.000
All right, in that case, oh, Amanda.

17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.500
Can I make a motion?

18
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:26.000
Do you feel like I'm jumping the gun if i yeah i might want to just go around get some discussion before oh i just thought no one had anything to say but because i'm ready to move on to motion whenever i don't have anything to say representative Thank you.

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Turn on your mics.

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If the sponsor was here, I would get clarification, but.

21
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It's not so.

22
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Representative Jammeron?

23
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Anything?

24
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Representative Gafford?

25
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Um.

26
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
.

27
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
.

28
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
.

29
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but he is not.

30
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So.

31
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
William Moore, Representative Jammeron?

32
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
William Moore, Representative Gaffer?

33
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Representative Gaffer?

34
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:10.500
I believe that there are ways that you can get your right to carry again, particularly if it is not a violent crime.

35
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.500
It might be a process, a long process in some cases, but there is a process in place.

36
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:39.000
So I would recommend that the prime sponsor, if they wish to actually pursue something like that, take a look at the sentencing and how long it takes to remove the felony so that they could carry arms again.

37
00:02:39.000 --> 00:04:06.500
But on the same token, as a consumer and as a Nashuaite, I guess, or a New Hampshireite, I don't believe if you're a felon that you should be able to carry a gun that's my personal belief thank you and just to clarify I think you're looking for the word annulment which is a current process in New Hampshire yes when all the criminal offense whether it be misdemeanor or acceptable felony level offense uh when looking at this bill I look at it as more of an enrollment issue than i do an issue of restricting the felons currently and misdemeanors uh one of the issues that we do have is the state courts obviously have no authority over federal courts which would still be problematic for the intent i think of this bill in addition i believe that going forward hopefully we can get a better bill that does address streamlining the annulment process, which currently is the only process to restore either misdemeanor or felony rights if it's a qualifying misdemeanor.

38
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:18.500
And that stipulates a certain time frame that we may want to look at as legislators if someone so chooses to file a bill.

39
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:33.000
At this point, i would entertain any motions um i'd like to make a motion of itl there's a second motion to itl representative uh bolden Motion to ITL.

40
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Representative Bolden?

41
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Yes.

42
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Representative Jammeron?

43
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Yes.

44
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Representative Tenzar?

45
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000

Thank you.

104
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.000
This subcommittee work session on House Bill 512, FN.

105
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It's a bill exempting firearms manufactured in New Hampshire from federal laws and regulations.

106
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.500
We have anybody to testify.

107
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.500
I don't have any blue cards.

108
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.500
All right, members of the committee.

109
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:33.500
Members of the committee All right seen nobody's has any I did want to mention that.

110
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.500
Soon after we heard this in committee and.

111
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:46.500
Move to retain it, I had the opportunity to go to the 6, our academy as a student.

112
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.500
I paid.

113
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.500
i think it was $25 for the class.

114
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:59.000
Very, very intuitive class on silencers, or some people would call noise suppressors.

115
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Learned many things.

116
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000
One of which, the person that made the first suppressor was also a ham radio operator.

117
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And guess what?

118
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.500
I'm a ham radio operator.

119
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:40.000
One of the things that happened in the class we had some time to for questions and answers because they were talking about regulatory problems that they have um and the laws surrounding them is that um sig sour at least um that's a new hampshire manufacturer of firearm parts and firearms is.

120
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Is fine with this bill passing, but they would never.

121
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Offer to a New Hampshire resident any farm.

122
00:08:49.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Firearm or accessories without going through the federal process, realizing that the whole purpose of this, this bill was to take into effect the 10th amendment to the United States Constitution saying that the state anything not delegated to the federal Congress remains is retained by the states.

123
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.500
It's retained by the states because it's not an interstate commerce.

124
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:51.500
commerce the problem being is that most of these manufacturers do engage in interstate commerce sigsauer ruger a lot of the other smaller companies here in new hampshire and we have several firearm manufacturers in new hampshire and the problem becomes if they try to sell something to a new hampshire resident exempting the laws, they put their federal firearms license or manufacturing license in jeopardy.

125
00:09:51.500 --> 00:10:00.000
And as you know, Sig Sauer is the main manufacturer of firearms for the United States military.

126
00:10:00.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And again, even if this bill were to pass, they would not offer anything to a New Hampshire citizen without going through the federal process that being said I don't know if anybody else has any other comments but that's pretty much the what I got out of that class that I went to it was a four-hour course very very intuitive even if you're not a firearms enthusiast it's a really good class to talk about the history the regulation and all those other things and how it works we got a chance to go and shoot suppressed fire it was really nice i have a question oh where did you take that uh it was at the sigsar academy in epping they offer it i believe quarterly it's um trying to remember the name of the class it was the fire it was was something to do with silence, Sancer Co, which is the company that also manufacturers them worked in concert with them to give that and that actually is open to the general public.

127
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
It was probably 40 people in the class.

128
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Thank you.

129
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:48.500
So it sounds like, from what I've heard that the manufacturing side of things find this to be possibly problematic with the current language that was drafted.

130
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.500
That's correct.

131
00:11:50.500 --> 00:12:30.000
Actually, one of the questions I had asked was, I believe Texas passed a very similar law about six, seven years ago, and they found that the manufacturers down there were offering items for sale to the general public in texas and the federal government came in and said you're a federal licensee and we will suspend your your federal license if you don't adhere to federal guidelines um well that's overreacher that's a that's for a court decide.

132
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:43.500
But if we pass this and one of the manufacturers did offer for sale to New Hampshire resident, they're putting their federal permits and licenses in jeopardy.

133
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:59.500
So I look at it as an issue where I support the general premise of this language for this bill, but I don't understand if it's ready for prime time just yet.

134
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:20.000
I think a lot more research needs to go into it to make sure that the manufacturing side is protected since all fire manufacturers in New Hampshire are only regulated by the United States federal government, not by any state entities.

135
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.500
I concur with Representative Stone on that.

136
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.500
Anybody like to make a motion?

137
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.500
I make a motion to ITL.

138
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.500
Second.

139
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.500
Thank you.

140
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.500
Second.

141
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.500
That's why I like our name tags on the tables.

142
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:47.500
It's too easy once we made in seconded to recommend to the full committee.

143
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.500
Around the table.

144
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.500
Yes.

145
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.500

Yes, yes.

148
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.500
Thank you.

149
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.500
Yes, yes, I concur.

150
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.500
Yes, yes.

151
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.000

204
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.500
you many meeting on house Bill 344FN.

205
00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:02.000
So I'd like to ask the committee, does anybody have anything they want to say?

206
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Well, maybe I should.

207
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
One of the.

209
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:20.000
all right so i like to pull the committee would you guys have anything you want to say about this particular bill anyone Yes.

210
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Thank you.

211
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
I just, I spoke with 1 of the co sponsors.

212
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Who informed me, Representative Thomas that she does not support the bill.

213
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.500
She's not sure how her name is on it.

214
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:49.500
Whether that whether something was, but, but I know at this point, she does not support the bill and had some concerns about, um.

215
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:59.500
Regarding the amount from 2 to 4 ounces, she suggested that would keep it in line with legalization amounts that.

216
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.500
There were some protections and guidelines missing from this bill.

217
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:18.000
She was unsure of the focus on hashish and thought that maybe that the legislation start with therapeutic patients first, then move forward to the general population.

218
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.500
That was just the input that I got from one of the co-sponsors.

219
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.500
Thank you.

220
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:32.000
She did send me an email expressing the same information, actually.

221
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.500
But she did mention that she had another bill coming through.

222
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.500
Yes.

223
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.500
Thank you.

224
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.000
I do support the legalization of marijuana.

225
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:54.000
However, I think the language in this bill falls short of something that we can responsibly send forward.

226
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:06.500
And looking at it, we are in New Hampshire, which is a state surrounded by other states currently that allow marijuana possession and also sales.

227
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:43.000
I think there's more comprehensive legislation that's been introduced that's still floating around out there that would better serve our purposes and moving forward thank you yes thank you so I just have a concern there's no provision in here for people who live in apartment buildings and my concern too is that if you are giving people marijuana that you grew at home what it could be, you know, increased fentanyl risk.

228
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.500
I think that that's a concern too is what's in it.

229
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:57.000
I am not a proponent of legalizing marijuana, but my constituents, there's a strong push for that.

230
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:13.500
So I'd be willing to look at homegrown as long as there was, you know, some strict guidelines as far as living in multiple families, how to protect kids and address the bed.

231
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:18.500
I don't know if that's possible, but any contamination risk.

232
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.500
Thank you.

233
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.500
Thank you.

234
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.000
That was my main concern as well.

235
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
I'm not, you know, one that believes in legalizing cannabis at all.

236
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Honestly, Thank you.

237
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.500
That was my main concern as well.

238
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:44.000
I'm not, you know, one that believes in legalizing cannabis at all, honestly.

239
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.500
But I do believe that given across New Hampshire, we're building, putting up all these apartment buildings.

240
00:19:52.500 --> 00:20:00.500
And here it states that you can have six per person, over 21, 21 and over.

241
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:40.500
and I can't imagine we're just putting up a 400 unit 400 people unit in Nashua I can't even imagine that where the adults let's say if it's two adults in each house and 12 plants there 12 plants in each one of those I cannot ever imagine something like And I, you know, and not only that, just, just think about it with the children involved, okay, because they're low income and market rate housing that we're putting up.

242
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:45.000
And I don't know, I just can't comprehend it.

243
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:58.000
It won't sink in for me, but it is a concern about the health, the health and well-being of others as well, and children in particular.

244
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.500
And that's pretty much what I have to say.

245
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.500
Yes.

246
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:21.000
Just to follow up with that concern, one of the things I looked at was if this bill was to move forward, we'd be looking at some landlord-tenant issued rights that come up.

247
00:21:21.000 --> 00:22:35.000
that as you've mentioned subsidized housing especially federally uh projects could jeopardize their housing situations by allowing something that would be authorized and legal in the state of new hampshire but the federal agencies do not acknowledge as being legal so i think there's a lot more work that needs to be done before this bill would move forward yes so do i have a motion medical merit but this doesn't address this is just personal for recreation right okay then yeah that's fine so you want to um okay so we have a motion on the second okay so we have a motion on the floor to itl and i will start with the site your vote yes yes yes yes yes yes in anisa vote six to zero for itl on hb 344 thank you um if no further comments then we will adjourn Thank you.

248
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
If no further comments, then we will adjourn.

249
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Thank you.

250
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
My goodness.

251
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
That's why I said.

252
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Thank you.
