00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
we'll open up uh the subcommittee on HB
 
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
1365 in which the subcommittee already
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
had passed a motion to uh interim study
 
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
the bill but there's been a request to
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
revisit this issue um and since it's
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
just a subcommittee we're we certainly
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
can do that so who who is here in the
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
audience who's here for 1365 please
 
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
raise your hand okay is there anyone
 
00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
here who um thinks the interim study uh
 
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
decision

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
okay okay so the rest of you are here
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
because you think we should pass this
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
bill is that correct everybody thinks we
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
should pass this bill okay so um I'm
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
willing to revisit this issue on the
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
grounds that what we do in Commerce is
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
what we care about is insurance and cost
 
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.510 align:start position:0%
what we care about is insurance and cost
to

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
insurance and certainly we don't like to
 
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
see any mandated uh plan that would
 
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
actually increase costs to people so in
 
00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 align:start position:0%
that sense is uh we would pass the bill
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
with some kind of an amendment that
 
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
ensures that um these this does not
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
increase the cost I had gotten uh an
 
00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:02.510 align:start position:0%
increase the cost I had gotten uh an
email

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
um that uh said a pharmacist may
 
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
substitute an interchangeable biological
 
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
but not at an increase to cost to the
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
patient I'm not sure that works
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
either because that's increased cost to
 
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
the insurance compan is what is I mean
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
cost of the patient versus the cost of
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
the thing um
 
00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
from is who what insurance companies do
 
00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
we have here in the room we have anybody
 
00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:35.550 align:start position:0%
we have here in the room we have anybody
in

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
Insurance want to speak for the
 
00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:38.829 align:start position:0%
Insurance want to speak for the
insurance

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:40.509 align:start position:0%
insurance
companies

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
um what do what do you want to
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
do Mr chairman inter interim
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
studies okay you're you're in support of
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
keeping us the interim study I I'm in
 
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
support of examining the issue
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
thoroughly because there's been a lot of
 
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
differing opinions on this and there's
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
been information and and what some might
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
call misinformation and I think we need
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
to figure out what the truth is we
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to risk increased
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
costs because prescription providers
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
pull out of the market because they're
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
forced to do something that's different
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
than what their in network prescribers
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
would have them do or something
 
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
different than what the patient would
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
expect and I know you want to you want
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
to keep concentrate this on the the the
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
segments that are specifically chartered
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
to Commerce which is Insurance correct
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
um but part of insurance and part of
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
healthc care costs in general are not
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
doing things that could
 
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
impact onward care in other words if a
 
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
25-year-old new grad pharmacist from you
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
know Mass College of Pharmacy which is a
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
good school um working at the grocery
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
store pharmacy decides they want to give
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
you something different than what your
 
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
40 years of experience Dartmouth hemo
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
oncologist with two fellowships decides
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
I mean that impacts the care plan and
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately the cost of care for that
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
patient and we should look
 
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
into and I'm absolutely willing to work
 
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
on it over the summer truly work on it
 
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
more than just one meeting in October
 
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
look at the definition of
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
interchangeable and biosimilar we have
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
two separate things in our country in
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
Europe interchangeable is a synonym for
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
biosimilar they don't separately Define
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
them and this practice does what the
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
bill asks a different practice occurs
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
but what the bill asks for in our
 
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
country doesn't happen in Europe it
 
00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
simply doesn't I've been in the med in
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
this device and diagnostic industry for
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
20 plus years globally in every
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
continent is this a conflict no um we're
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
we're not a Pharma we're not a Pharma at
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
all we're transplant Diagnostic and uh
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
Med device there's no conflict at all we
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
don't do anything with drugs
 
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you I would have disclosed
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
that had there
 
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
been uh we do have experts here and and
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
but but if the experts are going to talk
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
biological which is you're talking about
 
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
about the biological seminar bi this and
 
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
all that stuff again I don't want this
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
bill in this
 
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
committee here it's here it's here and
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
so therefore right now I want get R of
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
this bill all all the more reason inter
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
room study it no right no wrong all the
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
more reason to pass it
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
no let the people who really do know
 
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
what they're talking about and really
 
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
understand this business we really know
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
we're let decide that this is not a good
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
answer we've seen emails we've heard
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
testimony uh ju I have a I got to make a
 
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
comment I I think I know where you guys
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
are all coming from and I'm going to
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
defend your position okay okay then okay
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
at this point I I uh you know
 
00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
I is this is this bill is if it
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
it would have should have come to us
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
only as a second Committee in terms of
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
whether there was a impact for insurance
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
okay um since I have not heard from any
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
insurance company saying this is a
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
problem I've heard no the the only
 
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
people who I've technically heard about
 
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
negative things about is from a drug
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
company which obviously or a biological
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer which obviously that's not
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
a good good example so at this point
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
interim studying this bill would have
 
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
been fine if we could have then vacated
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
it to another committee to Health and
 
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
Human Services but we can't it is stuck
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
in our committee so I um absolutely
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
believe that when it comes to this this
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
issue coming up to this uh U next
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
September we're not going to get any
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
farther along than where we are right
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
now so that let's just send this along
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
and let the Senate you know decide
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
whether what your concerns are are
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
legitimate or not okay Mr chairman we we
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
never do that we don't just pass bills
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to look at them we
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
want to let the Senate do it yes we do
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
we we do not Advocate our responsibility
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
on that and there are I think we just
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
did that with the marijuana bill okay we
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
just sent him something that we know
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
pretty well that they're not going to
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
like well this would be another one and
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
by the way some of us did look into this
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
quite a bit hours and hours and hours
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
and hours I cannot say that I will know
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
any more today in a month that I know
 
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
right now and I'm ready to argue for
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
this bill on the merits of the facts and
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
that is all exactly and representative
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
spear is one of the most long research
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
researching Representatives I think
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
we've ever encountered on this committee
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
and so she should be able to present
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
that information I should present my
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
information we should do our
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility and frankly it's too much
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
to deal with today no right we voted 50
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
bipartisan unanimous to to to recommend
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
to the full committee that interim stud
 
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
is the right way to go and especially
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
with the piles of information we've
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
received in the interim that tells us
 
00:14:07.949 --> 00:14:07.959 align:start position:0%
that interim study is the right motion
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman you said it yourself okay
 
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
the bill is not ready for you finished
 
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
done there was something false about
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
what you just
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
said the information that we received
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I also I do want to say that
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
you said that Europe is not using bio
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
simers or hav't regul they've done more
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
the EU has done more than we have in the
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
US they're not doing what this bill asks
 
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
they're absolutely not they do not
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
substitute interchangeables for
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
interchangeables and the word
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
interchangeable means something
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
different in the MDR the medical device
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
device regulations it simply has a
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
different meaning you might not know if
 
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
you're not in the business but I'm in
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
the business and I'm telling you we've
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
also heard testimony to that fact
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
written and oral that interchangeable
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
and biosimilar are literally synonyms
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
like chips and in this country they're
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
not correct that's exactly my point in
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
Europe they are here they're not tell it
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
is okay everybody's made a point right
 
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
everybody hases anybody feel like
 
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
they've not said what they need to say I
 
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
just want to say I don't think we're
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
bright enough to handle this
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
ouch according to what so I I I have a
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
couple of things couple of points I want
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
to make first of all when we had the
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
last inim study I went along with
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
everybody else and voted inim study
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
because at that point we received
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
information from amen that said it
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
should have been handled at the federal
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
level meanwhile I go on the internet and
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
find out they one of the biggest sellers
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
of biosimilars in the world so why are
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
they telling us we can't have
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
biosimilars but they're selling them
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
like crazy in the world so I don't trust
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
anything that they say and I've got
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
documentation all over the place that
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
proves that okay so now I say the
 
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
information we were given that day was
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
not complete and so I went back and I
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
studied it and I studied it as good as
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
I've studied anything and now we have
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
some information now the the people that
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
complained about the only the only
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
documents we got and complain of this
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
thing was from the rheumatoid arthritis
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
folks so I went online and it turns out
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
the National Institutes of Health did a
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
study or collected a study in which they
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to find out why are they the only
 
00:16:17.069 --> 00:16:17.079 align:start position:0%
people complaining because the diabetes
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
people aren't complaining the cancer
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
people aren't complaining the Crohn's
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
disease people aren't complaining the MS
 
00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
people aren't complaining why are they
 
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
complaining they're complaining because
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
the doctors don't know what inter
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
changeable biosimilars are interchange
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
which is the only subset of do drugs
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today the
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biosimilars are the
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
drugs that get switching studies they
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
are so similar that they are almost
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
direct Replacements they go through
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
switching studies and the switching
 
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
studies are described in this document
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
then they ask the the people why do you
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
not like it and the only complaint they
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
had was because people didn't feel
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the idea that a
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
drugstore was adjusting a change however
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't say that the drugstore
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
gets to do that it has to do it with the
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
patient's knowledge it has to do it with
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
the patient's knowledge and it has to
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
send an information piece back to the
 
00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
doctor so those two things are taken
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
care of outside of that we haven't heard
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
anything that says there's a complaint
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
against this and that's what I have to
 
00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
say about this right
 
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
now okay represent M you have a well the
 
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
the fact is we do have biosimilars and
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
and interchangeables in our state and
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're a good thing and they do help
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
cut costs what we don't have are free
 
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
substitutions by a non-health care
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
provider right the pharmacist what do
 
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
you mean non-health care provider so
 
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
it's a pharmacist it's not a prescriber
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
they are dispensers they are not
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
prescribers by our statutes a pharmacist
 
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
does not prescribe medicine MDS dos NPS
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
and PAs prescribe medicine in our state
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay right so if anything if you want to
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
send the second committe
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
Ed this is again again this is the
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
reason why that's exactly that's the
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
reason why this bill needs to get out of
 
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
this that's why it should go to interim
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
study because you're correct it should
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
have gone to a second committee so back
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
to the point we have bios symbolis and
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
interchanges what we don't have is
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
dispensers non-prescribers of medicine
 
00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
making a decision that is different than
 
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
what the doctor and patient decided
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
about their complicated hemo oncology
 
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
course of treatment willy-nilly deciding
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a pill and not
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's not what this thing says that is
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
not what this says so in incorrect this
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
says that we will allow and will be the
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
only state in the country to allow it
 
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
and we don't like to be outliers and you
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
know Mr chairman as well as I do we do
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
not want to be an outlier in this we are
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
the only state we would be the only
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
state to allow interchangeable for
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
interchangeable substitution by a
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
dispenser and not a prescriber without
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
consultation it's notification after the
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
fact you know as well as I do it'll be a
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
note in the my chart echart system that
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
some medical assistant we see and that
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
prescriber will never see it it's not
 
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
colum and say what do you think but you
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
know what is colum and what you think
 
00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:05.799 align:start position:0%
it's all the time that a cancer patient
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
spends with their esteemed hemo
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
oncologist deciding what course of drugs
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
is the best and I'm telling you I just
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
went through it I know specifically how
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
difficult it is to make the decision on
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
a cocktail of drugs for a hemo oncology
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
patient right and my point is we nobody
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
else in the country does it we'd be the
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
first to do that to to insert the
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in that and that's says
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
nothing about the form factor right a
 
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
needle that you have to assemble put a
 
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
needle on like a Victoza or an OIC
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
versus a trulicity or a m they're
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
totally different you're going into
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
place I don't want to go okay
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
representative pelli nice of you to come
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
in uh have uh youve thought about this
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
issue at all yes yes and my question is
 
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
I want to understand the change um in
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
the role and responsibility of the
 
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.070 align:start position:0%
the role and responsibility of the
pharmacist

00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
pharmacist
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
so will you know how ex how exactly will
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
the role of the pharmacist change and
 
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
have we really heard from that Community
 
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
to see if they're comfortable with
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
making these decisions yeah we have
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
somebody the sponsor is a pharmacist
 
00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:16.039 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry I didn't okay or retired
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
retired you still have your license okay
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
so you still a license for so but the
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
role and responsibility of the
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacist will be changing is and that
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
is my understanding it it has the
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
appearance of that and that was what my
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
concern you know it has the can I just
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
like can I run my meeting the way I want
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
to run it thank you very
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
much I can see that okay so I understand
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
that you know the patient can say no I I
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
want to but the patient will not
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
understand what a bios I mean I can
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
guarantee you 99% of patients will
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
probably not understand the the concept
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
the consequences or whatever I I
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
definitely want to make sure that we're
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
providing the best choices for and the
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
least expensive choices for the patient
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
that's not a question I just want to
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that the pharmacist has enough
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
information and they how is their role
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
and responsibility changing and then if
 
00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:12.039 align:start position:0%
there's a conflict between what the
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
pharmacist says and then the doctor
 
00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
finds out you know the patient is in the
 
00:21:18.269 --> 00:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
middle and that was just my concern and
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
and I before I let you speak Gary that
 
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
what I would emphasize is is that is the
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
communication when decision to
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
change okay my concern is that um I
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
would certainly hope it does not happen
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
in a vacuum that the uh pharmacist who I
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
understand from your college roommate is
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
incredibly overwhelmed got so much more
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
going on is not going to spend a lot of
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
time you know delving into it that there
 
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
is communication between the pharmacist
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
and the physician about before a
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
biochain and I don't see that in the
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
bill gear
 
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
so come on up turn the mic on please and
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
and I would like to see active as
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
opposed to passive communication like to
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
be outlined procedurally what has to
 
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
happen right would I guess the question
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
is if we required in this that the
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacist has to com uh touch it has to
 
00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:21.799 align:start position:0%
get an okay from the actual physici
 
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
before they make this that's not a bad
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
idea yeah it's it's impractical good
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
idea we
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
so in regards to the practice we do that
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
today with almost all the other brands
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
and generics on the
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
market the bill is very emphatic that
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
you shall inform the patient so the
 
00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
patient you have to have a conversation
 
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
with the patient and go over that with
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
them what you're trying to
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
accomplish so therefore it really comes
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
down to enabling it to happen not
 
00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
mandating that it happens as far as
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
prescribing for drugs under a
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreement like a phys
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
assistants there are pharmacists that
 
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:03.559 align:start position:0%
actually prescribe these drugs unlike
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
some of these people who have made a
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
comment saying we don't so when you
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
think about the amount of time we go to
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
school and graduate a doctorates degree
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
and come out of it we are considered
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
healthc care providers unlike some other
 
00:23:18.669 --> 00:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
people may want to think um we actually
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
have an NPI number we build insurance
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
companies so therefore what I'm trying
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
to communicate is there are three things
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
that are important here one
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's enabling it's not mandatory two we
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
have inform the patient and shall it
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't say should it says shall inform
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
the patient so you have to have a
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
conversation with the patient about what
 
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:48.039 align:start position:0%
you're doing so would you be okay if we
 
00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
say have to inform the patient and the
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
prescribing phys it does say that I
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
don't see a prescribing physician it
 
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
does if you go back and look at we it
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
says within 3 days we have to inform the
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
that it's on I don't have the bill in
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
bill that's the after the fact and it
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
could be a note in the chart within
 
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
three business days following the
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
dispens the dispens which is the same
 
00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:21.559 align:start position:0%
requirement today of the specific
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
product provided to the patient
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
including the name is but communic be
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
conveyed by making entry yeah but I
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
don't see this going to the Pharm to the
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
to the to the prescriber it goes to the
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
prescription it says to the patient
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
after listening to on the radio about
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
how the big screw up of the computer
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
systems and the shutdown and and how
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
they're still don't see in here that I I
 
00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
could see that it's being entered in the
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
system but I don't see all I'm asking is
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
that shall inform the patient and the
 
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
prescriber correct just simply all I'm
 
00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
asking is up at the top where shall
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
shall inform the patient and the
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
prescriber yeah correct I think it shall
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
they definitely if you want to amend it
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
to say that they shall inform the
 
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
prescriber as well as the patient I'm
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay with that okay you want to be clear
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
about that yes but I want to be clear
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
that at this point in time the way I
 
00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:23.559 align:start position:0%
read this this all just tells me is that
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's entered into the computer and that
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
does not mean the physician will have
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
ever seen it
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
so practically how would they get
 
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
notified if it's if we amend it like
 
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
that like you're going to wait until the
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
doctor calls you back and they're as
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
busy as the phac the at this point I'm
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
just saying shall inform the patient and
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
and the prescriber okay what if the
 
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
patient doesn't pick it up usually
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
somebody else picks up the medicine for
 
00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:47.559 align:start position:0%
the really sick people and that's where
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
these drugs are right that's these
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
biologics and I have absolutely picked
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
up drugs for my wife and yes I've waved
 
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
being t to the information and that and
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
all that stuff okay but the the key and
 
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.510 align:start position:0%
all that stuff okay but the the key and
I

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
think presol hit it right on the nail
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
yes which is that we the patient has no
 
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.269 align:start position:0%
yes which is that we the patient has no
clue

00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
clue
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
anyways okay and that we want we want
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
you're you of course you would but the
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
rest of us would have no idea okay so we
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
all I'm asking is is that the physician
 
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
is given notification and therefore
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
Advance I'm not worried about the timing
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
because we're just worried about them
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
getting notified okay that that a change
 
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
has occurred Mr chairman if I may and
 
00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:34.039 align:start position:0%
then within 3 days it'll be entered into
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
the computer system right represent
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
pcell do you think that's a I would also
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
like to just look at the my version of
 
00:26:46.029 --> 00:26:46.039 align:start position:0%
the bill page two line 18 entry into an
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
electronic record system as described in
 
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
this paragraph is presumed to provide
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
notice to the prescriber so I'd like to
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
strike that and say the pharmacist shall
 
00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.269 align:start position:0%
strike that and say the pharmacist shall
communicate

00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
the product to the prescriber using you
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
know the following devices if that if
 
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
that is approprate I think that's we do
 
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
that today as far as but I would like it
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
that take out that that was put in there
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
from the prior um when we could go from
 
00:27:14.909 --> 00:27:14.919 align:start position:0%
A to B and a to c this is going from B
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
to C so I I hear where you're coming
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
from I totally support it we have to do
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
that today when you have a flu vaccine
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
we have to inform the patient as well as
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
the physician that prescribed it so
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
please clarify for me so you agree or
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
disagree that we're going to remove line
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
18 uh
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
B on page two I think I would keep it
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
but I would make it say that they shall
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
is presumed to provide notice to
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
prescrib shall they shall we have to
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
have some
 
00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:50.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
is that's that's that's good but then
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
you have the word otherwise so I want to
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
make sure we're taking out otherwise
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
well this this stuff here is actually in
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
the current statute now right in terms
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
of what the bio similar I'm I'm I'm
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
really scared to go changing that okay
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
because that's current law so you know I
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
mean if we're if we're just dealing with
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
this other issue
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I hate to change that I I hear
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
you that the way you read that is says
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem correct so but that if
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
we want to reinforce what is the right
 
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
answer for because of what we're talking
 
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
about is these um these bios similars we
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
really want to have in that section you
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
the stuff that we're adding new we want
 
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure in there that is where the
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
um the the provider needs to be informed
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
so represent hun you're talking about
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
going be clear about the amendment on
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
line 10 where it says within three
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
business days following the dispensing
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
of a biological product the in
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
pharmacist or pharmacis shall notify the
 
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
prescriber be clear that's what they're
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
doing okay so um so I guess where
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
where's the heart of this bill the heart
 
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
of the heart of what we're
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
changing is all B to C yeah where is B
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
to C in here I
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
think where where is that Lang it's in
 
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking at the bold face
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
language bottom page one top of page
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
line 30 and the top of page two the
 
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
provision shall mean that all biological
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
brought listed by the food
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
as interchangeable to reference
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
bilateral product are themselves
 
00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:34.039 align:start position:0%
interchangeable with each
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
other that's the Crux of it that that's
 
00:29:40.509 --> 00:29:40.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.519 --> 00:29:42.269 align:start position:0%
 
states

00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:44.519 align:start position:0%
so but that's also the Crux of
 
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
everything we want to do here right so
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
what I'm I'm I'm I'm without mucking up
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
the current LA decision yeah without
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
McKing up the current law if
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
um the provision shall
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
mean that all bisted by the food Runners
 
00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.669 align:start position:0%
mean that all bisted by the food Runners
is

00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
interchangeable products are themselves
 
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
interchangeable with each
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
other and then however however if
 
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.549 align:start position:0%
other and then however however if
if

00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
um no no no however if this is used it
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
has to you have to inform the prescriber
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
the prescriber has to approve what about
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
right underneath it I know you don't
 
00:30:26.669 --> 00:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
want to change the existing law but um
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
online three on page two right uh Roman
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
numeral 4 it says shall inform the
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
patient can we just add and the
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
prescriber yeah I I I think that's the
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
simplest thing to do I think it' be
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
simple that's logical but then I'm sorry
 
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
I just I'm not really I just want to
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand would it conflict
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
with Section
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
six section six is more 10 section six
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
talks about the timeline and the process
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
to do it I just want to make sure that
 
00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:57.789 align:start position:0%
to do it I just want to make sure that
correct

00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:57.799 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't I want to make sure there's
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
not that 3-day loophole if we add and
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
the um provider on line
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
four on line four is I think what we're
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is that the pharmacist
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
is responsible to inform both the
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
patient and the prescriber corre section
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
six talks about how that happens an
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
interchangeable prodct for the
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
prescriber correct because shall inform
 
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
do there
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
informing be uh well then it would be
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
shall inform the patient in the prescrib
 
00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.430 align:start position:0%
shall inform the patient in the prescrib
prior

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
to not prior to because that's a
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
question at that point in time is it's
 
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
back to allowing for The Interchange to
 
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
happen think of it this way if you walk
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
into the pharmacy today and you have a
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
brand name
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
prescription you have to inform the
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
patient if you're going to substitute a
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
generic they have to agree to it if they
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
don't agree to it yeah but wait a minute
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
this it's already been filled no before
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
you fill it right so that's all I want
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
to add is shall inform the patient and
 
00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
the prescriber prior to filling the
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
order there correct but you have to have
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
a time frame in there if you want to do
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
it that it's kind quick prior is prior
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
prior to filling PRI prior don't don't
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
fill it until
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
you inform the prescri the prescriber
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
informing the prescriber is different
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
than asking for the
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
authorization be clear about that I I am
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay with the fact that all
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're doing is informing the prescriber
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
correct and not asking for approval
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
because we know that is a delay correct
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
okay that but that as long as the you
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
know that the prescriber has been
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
informed that at that point if the
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
prescriber has a problem then they will
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
then they will call up the pharmacist
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
and say don't do that don't fill that if
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
I understand it correctly chairman hunt
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
when I'm filling the
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
prescription I both have to inform the
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
patient so the patient has the right to
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
refuse it correct okay number number two
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
inform the prescribers so that they're
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
aware of it correct that's it now the
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
question I to be careful of is that when
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
there we do it prior it's prior
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
somewhere I I believe that that section
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
six is just the procedurally process of
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
getting into the computer system a for
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
you to get paid and B is to get into
 
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
their health records cor that's what I I
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
so so in other words mechanically if I'm
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
doing something prior to actually giving
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
to the patient which is dispensing it I
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
still have an requirement to send a
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
notification to the prescriber before I
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
give it to the patient correct because
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
when we see shall inform the patient I
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
assume we all assume that the pharmacist
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
is talking to the patient by phone
 
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
either in person or by phone correct
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
talking to the patient by phone so that
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
we are assuming that same
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
methodology what happened with the
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
prescriber so therefore that that the
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
pharmacist is calling the the the
 
00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.549 align:start position:0%
pharmacist is calling the the the
physician's

00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
physician's
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
office and saying is I'm I'm letting you
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
know by Statute that I'm required
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
letting you know that I am doing an
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
interchangeable based upon what the
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
prescription was written but I am doing
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
this okay as long as it's as long as
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
we're informing the prescribers because
 
00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
I don't want to hang up the patient at
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
the counter and I have to wait for the
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
doctors on vacation for 7 days to come
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
back that's not going to help we all
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
know that's not that I mean we've all
 
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
had our prescriptions filled and yes we
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
you they have a nurse on staff who whose
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to is to get that okay
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
so but that what we're trying to do here
 
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.629 align:start position:0%
so but that what we're trying to do here
is

00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that no that when something were
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
to H bad happen or something wrong to
 
00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
happen or whether the physician knows
 
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
there's something different they should
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
a have written it on the prescription to
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
okay so we're not not withstanding that
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
they have that responsibility if they
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
think there's something wrong but what
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
we're doing is just ensuring that that
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
communication has occurred in terms of
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist is letting not giving a
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
verbal notification through that phone
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
call or talking with that nurse to say
 
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
by the way I am using this statute to uh
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
to change that prescription as long as
 
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
we don't get into the the process of how
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
we inform because it could be a phone
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
call it could be like with e prescribing
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
now was something e prescribed we can
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
send back a note back to the position I
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
got car G car this is current law
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
correct right and it's working it's
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
current law and so as far as we know you
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
know that that that is acceptable yeah
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
process let's leave it let's leave it at
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
that but we're just adding that it's it
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop with just informing the
 
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
patient because we realize the patient
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
this is going to be way over their head
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
because it's way over my head okay but
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
what's really going on here but that
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
there is a notification system that it
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
it occurs let alone that within three
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
days that that physician when he comes
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
back from their vacation or comes or
 
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
finally decides said gee I wonder what
 
00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:14.839 align:start position:0%
happened to that patient you know
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
because I got that information they'll
 
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
know exactly what happened when they see
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
that that filing which probably happens
 
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
in 24 hours not 3 days probably and what
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
I would suggest I do like where you're
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
going I think it has a lot of merage to
 
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
it by simply taking line three and
 
00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
four is when a Pharm is dispensing is
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
you shall inform the patient and the
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
prescriber I think it's critical that
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
the prescriber is aware of it I agre sir
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
I just I just want to be um now let's go
 
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
be realistic so when most patients walk
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
in and the pharmacist said hey I have an
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biosimilar that I'm
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
going to give you instead most patients
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
will say I have no idea what you mean I
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
need you need to contact my prescriber
 
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure he's okay with that I mean
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's what's reality think will happen
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure the spirit
 
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
of that process is going to be followed
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
and that the patient understands that
 
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
they're this is what is going to happen
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
and they probably will if it was me I
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
would say no not until you tell my
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
prescriber and he says okay and then
 
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
we're good and that's your choice we do
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
that today quite frankly with diabetic
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
patients all the time as far as the
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
insulin a brand of insulin we're giving
 
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
um there's multiple brands of the same
 
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
basic insulin so at that point in time
 
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
the patients probably know know more
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
about their body than anyone else and
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
what works and what doesn't work and I'm
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
sure you don't know this but are there
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
any incidents or um problems that have
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
been reported because the process was
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
not followed or something else was
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
prescribed and the patient had a
 
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
unexpected reaction I'm not aware of it
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
in fact the FDA went through a thorough
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
review which released in
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
October um to basically address that
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
issue and after looking at numerous
 
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
studies across multiple disease
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
States they found no statistical
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
difference between the two okay and okay
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
and that basically helped the FDA at
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
that point in time address the issue
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
based upon that the FDA is in a process
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
now formulating guidance to make the
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biologics the same as
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
biologics they were doing away with that
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
ter analogy because it's very confusing
 
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
M um and in Japan they've been doing it
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
for years I'm trying to get to I've not
 
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
been aware of any documentation that
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
this has been a problem and I have a
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
quick followup is there and is it true
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
that there is a finite list of these yes
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
there is it's a finite list you Happ to
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
know how many there are um I think
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
represent representative um Leon Leon um
 
00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
actually sent that yeah list if you look
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
at finite it's it's finite and it's
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
growing but just to give you a sense of
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
the economics of it again we're talking
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
about trying to save the insurance
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
company's money as well as the patients
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
um biologics in Europe are running
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
between 20 to 25% less than they are
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
here in this country so there's a huge
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
amount of money that can be saved by
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
bringing Market competition to the
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
market and finding ways to avoid
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
stifling the competition and the
 
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
insurance industry wants to have ways to
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
reduce cost and the pharmaceutical
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
it okay so um what we're going to do at
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
this point this is another amendment so
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
we're not going to I'm just going to end
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
this work session and we'll have an
 
00:39:43.309 --> 00:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
amendment drawn up and uh and then at
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
that point in time we can discuss
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
whether we would reconsider our actions
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
on interim
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
study Mr chairman if I make one thing
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
about somebody brought to my attention
 
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
with the amendment about um to ensure
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
is no what incre increased cost of the
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
patient what that's already in the it's
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
actually in that other statute was well
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the things that
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention when you folks
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
look at the amendment if a patient comes
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
in and they write
 
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
for a biologic but they want the brand
 
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.990 align:start position:0%
for a biologic but they want the brand
name

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
biologic they insist on it right now the
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
way the Amendments written I can't do
 
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
that because it would be an increased
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
cost to the patient so i' would like to
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
modify it where it says the farm shall
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
not substitute an interchangeable
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
biological product that result in
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
increased cost of the patient unless
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
approved by the patient so you're saying
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
the current law is a problem because
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation no current law
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
does not have
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
that no the current law does not have
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
that per say because the current law
 
00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.589 align:start position:0%
that per say because the current law
says

00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
um a pharmacist may substitute an
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
interchangeable biological but not at an
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
increased cost to the patient and that's
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to modify you're going to
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
put an amendment through because if the
 
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
patient wants to have a higher cost
 
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
product I'm prohibited from doing it
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
even though they want to pay more money
 
00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.109 align:start position:0%
even though they want to pay more money
for

00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
it I think the patient have the freedom
 
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
of choice that's all so but that's
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
current law it is I would not like to
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
modify if you're going to put an
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
amendment through may want to do it
 
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm okay with leaving it the
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
way it is yes the FDA rules be out when
 
00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:29.079 align:start position:0%
when will the FDA you mentioned FDA
 
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
forming guidance on this when when did
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
they expect to release that they
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
released um a letter if you will to the
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
public back in January I can get that to
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
you as well they're looking at changing
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
all the bio similar Logics I mean
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements so they're doing I
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
think for the most part investigating
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
that they don't even have to go through
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
switching studies that's what the FDA is
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
looking at which so the FD is looking at
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating the need for switching
 
00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
studies and releasing further guidance
 
00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
if that's going happen soon shouldn't we
 
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
not be the first state to do this we get
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
that information shouldn't we be ready
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
for it so when it gets released we can
 
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it not delay things
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
sure yeah and we can do that in interim
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
study no because if we have there's few
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
issues here right it's the few different
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
policy issues we're talking about I'm
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
all trying to make drugs more affordable
 
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
to patients that have been shown to be
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
safe and not trying to encourage the
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
industry with stifling competition I'm
 
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
trying to find ways to make the drugs
 
00:42:27.549 --> 00:42:27.559 align:start position:0%
fundamentally more affordable just to
 
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
give you an example himera right now is
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
over $80,000 a year folks $80,000 a year
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's a generic on the market another
 
00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559 align:start position:0%
one bio similar that is 90 85% less than
 
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
that less than $155,000 a year yeah I'm
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
aware it's an admirable reason to look
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
into this for sure okay which is why we
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
pass it great thank you very much one
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
second okay John one second yeah this
 
00:42:58.549 --> 00:42:58.559 align:start position:0%
paper that I gave you is an initial
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
study an initial set of guidance that's
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
coming out by the
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
FDA uh regarding insulin and a whole
 
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of other
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
biosimilars and you can get the details
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
if you go on to the website you can get
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
details for each one of those but that's
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
guidance that's not the law the law
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
comes out of the state okay so the issue
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
is these are bi this these are bi bi
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
similars not interchangeables and our
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
policy decision here is are we going to
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
allow interchangeables for
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
interchangeables RC Cola for Pep against
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
that of code it's even more
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
specific I uh I urge you to uh when if
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
you run for reelection next year put in
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
legislation to uh unwind or solve this
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
this nightmare but I'd rather get it
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:44:24.990 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
do

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:33.630 align:start position:0%
 
patient

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.839 --> 00:45:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:42.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.559 --> 00:46:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
guys

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
guys
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we will have this
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
time I don't know how many rules we
 
00:47:06.549 --> 00:47:06.559 align:start position:0%
broke there
 
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:09.559 align:start position:0%
okay okay let's talk about living Oregon
 
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
donors so what we have in front of us is
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
um Insurance departments uh my my
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
request for them
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
to create some language uh what's looked
 
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:23.559 align:start position:0%
around in terms of other states
 
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
evidently this is a uh
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
a movement and many states have been
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
doing this legislation and concern um
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
and um it really just comes down to
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's I yeah but I I hear that liver
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't really grow at this point but I
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
guess it I know that there are liver
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
transplants but but I don't you know so
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know how but anyway okay um so
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
so at this point is that uh one thing I
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
I do know done a little homework and and
 
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
an insurance company if you if you
 
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
already have life insurance they can't
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
renegotiate the terms over over kidney
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
anyways um because that they they would
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
be obligated to if they really wanted to
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
know whether you have given up a kidney
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
prior I mean I guess this is a good
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to discuss the difference
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
between between life insurance and
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
health insurance you know in life
 
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
insurance that the pre-existing
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
conditions are free to negotiate free to
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
debate and they can they can decide
 
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
whether they want to give you insurance
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
or whatever the premium they're going to
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
charge you has to be done at the time um
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
whereas we don't allow
 
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
pre-existing limitations on health
 
00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
insurance so I I think that sometimes
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
people get concerned and um that life
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
insurance is a is a free game in terms
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
of any of those issues are are can be
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
talked about and negotiated
 
00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
so um any anybody uh have any questions
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
and so what we're going to try to do is
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
is U this is modeled theoretically that
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
all the other a lot of states are doing
 
00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:23.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
great all right anybody have any
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh the problem is uh the
 
00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay so I have so we have
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
pel's here I'm here is
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
here and Vincent has been
 
00:49:48.119 --> 00:49:50.870 align:start position:0%
here and Vincent has been
removed

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
removed
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
and right this okay Anita is out of the
 
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
room but I I

department uh life and health director
 
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
we did two things
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the bill one was to add section five
 
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
which is ultimately a catchall
 
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination language no state
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
did the exact same thing um in 2021 en
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
coil put out a resolution which said
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
they liked this idea and they gave some
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
suggestions um and we in the spirit of
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
that so that was the one thing we did
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
the other thing we did is added
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
disability income Protection cover
 
00:51:59.789 --> 00:51:59.799 align:start position:0%
which is again when we scanned other
 
00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
states more often than not they had
 
00:52:04.589 --> 00:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
disability insurance protection coverage
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
as well the end coil resolution
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
reference disability insurance so
 
00:52:10.789 --> 00:52:10.799 align:start position:0%
there's three sections where we just
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
tacked on that language so it's really
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
only one change but it happens in three
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
places those are the two
 
00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:24.270 align:start position:0%
places those are the two
things

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%

to pass as amended
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
seconded represent buo and Scott you
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
want to have your
 
01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
last tell us why we shouldn't pass this
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill as
 
01:07:52.920 --> 01:08:00.990 align:start position:0%
bill as
amended

01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
to be sure that microphone's on uh this
 
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
is with the Distributors Association and
 
01:08:10.269 --> 01:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
and again um I appreciate the fact that
 
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
the bill was amended it doesn't change
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
our primary concern with the bill this
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
is not about brew pubs or distribution
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
this is about cross tier ownership and
 
01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
prohibited interests and one RSA 17911
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the state and chapter 27 of the
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
federal alcohol act um there's a reason
 
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission denied the
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
application for a brew pub initially and
 
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
that was because it's illegal um both at
 
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
the state and the federal level the Nano
 
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
Brewer was a a loophole that was
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
intended to provide an option for the ly
 
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.669 align:start position:0%
intended to provide an option for the ly
in

01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
question and uh
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
apparently that wasn't good enough so
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
here we are with the legislation so we
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
continue to oppose it on on the Merit
 
01:08:59.709 --> 01:08:59.719 align:start position:0%
that it does not help competition it
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
does not help small businesses it's bad
 
01:09:03.309 --> 01:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
for the industry in general and it sets
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
a terrible precedent moving forward so
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
um you've heard our arguments before
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
I'll keep it short and just wanted to go
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
on the record and say that we oppose it
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
um and we think that this is something
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's very dangerous for the industry
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
and for small businesses in New
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%

01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment says and
 
01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
does yeah turn your mic on turn your mic
 
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
on please everybody should have it in
 
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
front of them does anybody in the
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
audience not have it no I mean I don't
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's pretty it's pretty minor um
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
basically the original Bill had a bunch
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
of different categories of food so there
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
was like grilled meats and soups and
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
salads and all these other things pizzas
 
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
stuff like that we just took out all of
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
that to try to explain what food is and
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
what is counted as food and just said a
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
full course meal would be a diversified
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
selection of food I think that's that's
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
actually timely what I wanted to do
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
originally but I thought that it needed
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
to be defined and so I was actually glad
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
when liquor suggested we just take out
 
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
all that other stuff and then the old
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill will uh cut the 20 guests
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
um uh 20 20 guest requirement down um I
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
think it was 10 and so here we just
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
added language unless granted by The
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission so they can kind of go
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
in and and still have the ability to
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
enforce their concerns which is I guess
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
a bar opening up and then uh meal shall
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
be readily available and then we struck
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
out all that other language just above
 
01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.470 align:start position:0%
out all that other language just above
it

01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
and so by striking that out um I just
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
spoke with Danielle and that's going to
 
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
cause a reopening of how they Define
 
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
some of that stuff which I think will
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
accomplish the goals that I aim which
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
aim to achieve which is to make it a
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more flexible for restaurant
 
01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.390 align:start position:0%
little bit more flexible for restaurant
owners

01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
owners
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
to have some prepared foods that aren't
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily cooked or chopped up in the
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
kitchen but because maybe they don't
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
have the space but they can get it from
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere else but it's still restaurant
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
quality food and that will give them the
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
flexibility to do that because it's
 
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
going to open up the rules associated
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
with it and then U meal shall be readily
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
served to the table so
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
um that that obviously needs to be
 
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
required otherwise it's not really a
 
01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.229 align:start position:0%
required otherwise it's not really a
restaurant

01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
so so yeah anyways I don't think it's
 
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
particularly controversial I actually
 
01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
like that this amendment did more uh
 
01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
towards accomplishing my goals so so
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
you're happy I'm happy
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
yeah uh Danielle you
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.790 align:start position:0%
yeah uh Danielle you
mine

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
mine
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
good morning so are we now uh is the
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
rest of the story going to be in rules
 
01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of what the meals are and what
 
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
the rules of it y this will um the
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
Diversified selection of food has been a
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
standard that we've always looked at
 
01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
when looking at the menu um these
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
definitions are hard to look at in a
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
bubble because it's the totality of the
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
entire license there's several other
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
paragraphs that involve the food and the
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
requirements of the restaurant so
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
isolated it looks um like we're
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating some stuff but it really is
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
the totality of the business plan and
 
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
the establishment coming forward that we
 
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
look at each individual definition the
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
license requirements so um this will
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
cause some rule changes or some rules to
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
be reopened and looked at which is what
 
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
um representative San was talking about
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
so we can we can Define this more if we
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
need to within rule but I think this was
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
a good compromise it accomplished a
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
little bit what he wanted to accomplish
 
01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
and were able to um still look at the
 
01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
totality of the business plan and the
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances for the licenses all right
 
01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:04.149 align:start position:0%
circumstances for the licenses all right
great

01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.159 --> 01:14:06.030 align:start position:0%
 
M

01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
M
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else in the room who wants
 
01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
to weigh in speak now or forever more
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.270 align:start position:0%
 
s

01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
s
 
01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:29.709 align:start position:0%
s
but

01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
you you have a bunch of them over there
 
01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
hoarding oh that's it that's it yeah no
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
I have
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
it I just wonder what happened to the
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
pile because we thought they were all
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
at I give you a chance to read it before
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:52.189 align:start position:0%
 
action

01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:54.270 align:start position:0%
 
look

01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:57.990 align:start position:0%
look
okay

01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
right so I assume this some of the stuff
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
we Crossing out it's going to show up in
 
01:16:02.239 --> 01:16:06.310 align:start position:0%
we Crossing out it's going to show up in
rules

01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.470 align:start position:0%
 
or

01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
right I was amazed
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
I past couple years I a lot of of movies
 
01:16:20.189 --> 01:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
about restaurants and the reality is
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
that meals are all pre prepared and and
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
in these special drawers that they pull
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
out and voila there there's the meals so
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
correct and that's that's specifically
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
one of the rules that this will cause to
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
be reopened and looked at the rules that
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
say that meals can't be leased or
 
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
concessioned out um I think it's vague
 
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
in nature anyways in terms of what that
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
exactly means um so in discussions with
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan I think that's a
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
rule that needs to be cleaned up anyways
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
um and this this would cause that to be
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
to be reopened and looked at great
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
good okay so everybody's
 
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right so representative
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
Sullivan seconded by
 
01:17:15.149 --> 01:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:18.669 --> 01:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
0939 any discussion on the
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
motion all right seeing none all those
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
in favor say I all right one two three
 
01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
zip okay representative s second
 
01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
representative hunt moves ought to pass
 
01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.550 align:start position:0%
representative hunt moves ought to pass
as

01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
amended any discussion seeing none all
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
zip

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
all right and last but not
 
01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:12.149 align:start position:0%
all right and last but not
least

01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
1591 okay I assume the amendment's been
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
happy everybody happy except from that
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
guy and what
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.550 align:start position:0%
 
Jersey

01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:49.470 align:start position:0%
 
0840

01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
1591 and again this is uh this is just
 
01:18:52.639 --> 01:18:55.510 align:start position:0%
1591 and again this is uh this is just
adding

01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
um but replacing section 10 so just one
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
section of the bill is being being
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.629 --> 01:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
move second second
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
0840 seeing none
 
01:19:25.870 --> 01:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
all those in favor say
 
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:30.920 align:start position:0%

zip so I will move a to pass as
 
01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
amended seconded by representative
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%

01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
motion see none all those in favor

01:20:02.629 --> 01:20:02.639 align:start position:0%
it and we'll meet back here at
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:37:50.189 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.199 --> 01:40:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.920 --> 02:02:47.950 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.960 --> 03:20:25.030 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:20:25.030 --> 03:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:27.990 --> 03:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay we get
 
03:20:35.309 --> 03:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:39.269 --> 03:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
God guess who's spor okay
 
03:20:43.870 --> 03:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
John all right um so many transmitters
 
03:20:46.469 --> 03:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh if you might recall in their hearing
 
03:20:49.950 --> 03:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh an issue came up uh comparing the the
 
03:20:52.189 --> 03:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
big guys versus the little guys and the
 
03:20:58.110 --> 03:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
local guys and uh I'm sitting over here
 
03:21:00.590 --> 03:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
working out a potential
 
03:21:03.469 --> 03:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
solution um so at this point we don't
 
03:21:07.349 --> 03:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
have we don't have an amendment yet and
 
03:21:11.389 --> 03:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
uh so we'll move this off till next week
 
03:21:11.399 --> 03:21:13.030 align:start position:0%
uh so we'll move this off till next week
um

03:21:13.030 --> 03:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:23.670 --> 03:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:25.870 --> 03:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
resolution and what what we're trying to
 
03:21:28.189 --> 03:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
do is figure out how to carve out the
 
03:21:32.429 --> 03:21:32.439 align:start position:0%
the little the little ones from the big
 
03:21:36.229 --> 03:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
guys and um and what we're looking at
 
03:21:38.429 --> 03:21:38.439 align:start position:0%
right at the mount is these uh stored
 
03:21:38.439 --> 03:21:39.950 align:start position:0%
right at the mount is these uh stored
value

03:21:39.950 --> 03:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
value
 
03:21:42.469 --> 03:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
cards and that the little guy don't do
 
03:21:45.269 --> 03:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
that and and therefore we would exempt
 
03:21:48.469 --> 03:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
them what stored value a stored value
 
03:21:49.870 --> 03:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
card is that you're going to get your
 
03:21:53.830 --> 03:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
paycheck on a prepaid like a credit card
 
03:21:57.550 --> 03:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
oh okay right I got it
 
03:22:01.189 --> 03:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
right yeah when this is when cash isn't
 
03:22:01.199 --> 03:22:03.070 align:start position:0%
right yeah when this is when cash isn't
around

03:22:03.070 --> 03:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:22:09.070 --> 03:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
anymore um all I know was that that when
 
03:22:10.750 --> 03:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
I got rid of my Direct
 
03:22:13.590 --> 03:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
TV and they said we're going to give you
 
03:22:16.870 --> 03:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
a you know a rebate and and I was
 
03:22:19.550 --> 03:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
expecting it one of those debit Master
 
03:22:23.070 --> 03:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
cards and no they it was some some bank
 
03:22:25.469 --> 03:22:25.479 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to sign me up to a bank
 
03:22:26.830 --> 03:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
and they wanted me to you know it would
 
03:22:28.950 --> 03:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
be a prepaid debit card that they were
 
03:22:30.269 --> 03:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
hoping that I was going to reload it
 
03:22:31.990 --> 03:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
with my paycheck or
 
03:22:34.429 --> 03:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
something not that my paycheck will go
 
03:22:37.990 --> 03:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
very far but so um you paycheck from
 
03:22:40.750 --> 03:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
here yeah well it's it's my only
 
03:22:40.760 --> 03:22:43.550 align:start position:0%
here yeah well it's it's my only
employer

03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:22:47.950 --> 03:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
so so that that didn't go very far okay
 
03:22:50.309 --> 03:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
so we'll move on to next one 1444
 
03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:59.469 --> 03:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
ahead we had some exchanges about uh the
 
03:23:04.070 --> 03:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
term proprietary uh cryptocurrency on on
 
03:23:08.510 --> 03:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
1241 yeah um really yeah
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I I think I just like to hear the
 
03:23:13.229 --> 03:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
justification for adding the word
 
03:23:15.429 --> 03:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
proprietary to that
 
03:23:15.439 --> 03:23:17.469 align:start position:0%
proprietary to that
language

03:23:17.469 --> 03:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:23:22.469 --> 03:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:22.479 --> 03:23:25.630 align:start position:0%
 
correspondence

03:23:25.630 --> 03:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:29.910 --> 03:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
right yeah so in uh in the
 
03:23:32.950 --> 03:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
bill there there it's uh page 24 line
 
03:23:37.990 --> 03:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
24

03:23:40.670 --> 03:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
24
 
03:23:48.870 --> 03:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:50.910 --> 03:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
there and I'm looking I'm looking at an
 
03:23:53.790 --> 03:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
email from February
 
03:23:53.800 --> 03:23:56.550 align:start position:0%
email from February
13th

03:23:56.550 --> 03:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
13th
 
03:23:59.550 --> 03:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
03:24:03.070 --> 03:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
24 you could you say the page again sure
 
03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:12.110 --> 03:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon um
 
03:24:13.590 --> 03:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Bob lamber from the
 
03:24:16.229 --> 03:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
banking Department I it was a little
 
03:24:18.110 --> 03:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
tricky to hear but my understanding is
 
03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
the question about proprietary
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency is that where that came
 
03:24:25.189 --> 03:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
from in the uh so here's the email that
 
03:24:26.670 --> 03:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
I have it says the language here was
 
03:24:28.429 --> 03:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
added to try to address the Department's
 
03:24:30.630 --> 03:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
concern that if and when a business that
 
03:24:32.550 --> 03:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
engages in such
 
03:24:34.910 --> 03:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
inflation collapses consumers holding
 
03:24:37.710 --> 03:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
such tokens may be left without recourse
 
03:24:39.349 --> 03:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
the proposed language was added by the
 
03:24:41.269 --> 03:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
department to address this concern
 
03:24:42.269 --> 03:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
however the the department so to
 
03:24:44.110 --> 03:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
fine-tuning a language or further
 
03:24:46.950 --> 03:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
defining proprietary cryptocurrency to
 
03:24:48.510 --> 03:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
accomplish the goals of protecting
 
03:24:51.910 --> 03:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
consumers yep that's um that's just
 
03:24:54.030 --> 03:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
right the the what the department has
 
03:24:56.229 --> 03:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
seen over the past year or two
 
03:25:00.309 --> 03:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
specifically relating to the larger uh
 
03:25:04.150 --> 03:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
crypto companies um the most not notable
 
03:25:06.830 --> 03:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
example would be um
 
03:25:12.229 --> 03:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
FTX is Bad actors will use bad actor
 
03:25:16.030 --> 03:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
companies or entities may use uh
 
03:25:18.229 --> 03:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency or tokens that they
 
03:25:20.550 --> 03:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
themselves create and issue and inflate
 
03:25:22.790 --> 03:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
the value of those so that their balance
 
03:25:22.800 --> 03:25:23.670 align:start position:0%
the value of those so that their balance
sheet

03:25:23.670 --> 03:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
03:25:27.550 --> 03:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
looks uh better than it really is and so
 
03:25:28.389 --> 03:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
when these
 
03:25:33.550 --> 03:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
companies um go under consumers are then
 
03:25:35.950 --> 03:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
left with little to no recourse in terms
 
03:25:39.469 --> 03:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
of recovering funds so this language
 
03:25:41.670 --> 03:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
this is something the department added
 
03:25:43.349 --> 03:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh to try and address that so that they
 
03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
can't use that inflated value to uh
 
03:25:50.309 --> 03:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
increase the balance sheet um it is a
 
03:25:54.150 --> 03:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
sort of a a working term proprietary
 
03:25:56.070 --> 03:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency if if the committee
 
03:26:00.309 --> 03:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
thinks that it could be uh improved upon
 
03:26:02.269 --> 03:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh I think the department's open to that
 
03:26:04.150 --> 03:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
um but that's sort of the justification
 
03:26:07.189 --> 03:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
for adding it in there okay so I just
 
03:26:08.990 --> 03:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
have a couple questions about about that
 
03:26:11.030 --> 03:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
so in that sentence the word proprietary
 
03:26:13.110 --> 03:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
procceed s cryptocurrency and this is
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
comma non-f fundable tokens Toma comma
 
03:26:17.710 --> 03:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
other digital assets does the word
 
03:26:19.429 --> 03:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
proprietary apply to all three
 
03:26:22.950 --> 03:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
categories or not that that is the idea
 
03:26:26.389 --> 03:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and then just about every
 
03:26:29.710 --> 03:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
blockchain system has a native token
 
03:26:31.710 --> 03:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
that incentivizes the the blockchain
 
03:26:34.389 --> 03:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
itself so would that be considered a
 
03:26:37.590 --> 03:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
proprietary cryptocurrency if let's say
 
03:26:39.710 --> 03:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
someone created you know there's
 
03:26:42.590 --> 03:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of these things um um would
 
03:26:44.950 --> 03:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
that exclude every native token of a new
 
03:26:47.750 --> 03:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
blockchain um from the balance sheet
 
03:26:49.750 --> 03:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
when in fact they could have a real
 
03:26:49.760 --> 03:26:50.950 align:start position:0%
when in fact they could have a real
market

03:26:50.950 --> 03:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
market
 
03:26:52.870 --> 03:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
value I just want to be careful we're
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
not excluding legitimate Innovation from
 
03:26:59.189 --> 03:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
Bad actors like FTX which was I think
 
03:27:00.790 --> 03:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
they were headquartered in the Bahamas
 
03:27:05.429 --> 03:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
and outside of the US regulatory system
 
03:27:09.070 --> 03:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
anyway so FDX was licensed by us however
 
03:27:11.469 --> 03:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
as a m transmitter um for that portion
 
03:27:12.670 --> 03:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
of their business where they were doing
 
03:27:17.110 --> 03:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
fat to crypto money transmission
 
03:27:20.269 --> 03:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
um so I think what we're struggling with
 
03:27:22.590 --> 03:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
is the definition of proprietary what
 
03:27:25.950 --> 03:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
this is meant to prevent is like a money
 
03:27:29.590 --> 03:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
transmission company um creating its own
 
03:27:31.750 --> 03:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
token not necessarily using other
 
03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
people's right um so maybe we could I
 
03:27:38.429 --> 03:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
don't know if proprietary is defined in
 
03:27:39.750 --> 03:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
here but perhaps we could Define the
 
03:27:42.349 --> 03:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
word proprietary to to make sure it's
 
03:27:45.189 --> 03:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
narrow to that those circumstances does
 
03:27:48.790 --> 03:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
that seem reasonable yeah thats yeah
 
03:27:51.030 --> 03:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
would that help um solve your it's a
 
03:27:52.510 --> 03:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern right so I could
 
03:27:54.429 --> 03:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
create I could create a token I could
 
03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
sell it to someone I could create a
 
03:27:58.189 --> 03:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
billion tokens sell it to someone for a
 
03:27:59.429 --> 03:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
dollar and all of a sudden that token
 
03:28:01.070 --> 03:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
has a market cap of a billion dollars
 
03:28:02.830 --> 03:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
right like and if I have the rest of the
 
03:28:04.790 --> 03:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
tokens on my balance sheet I could I
 
03:28:06.950 --> 03:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
could claim that that's worth a lot of
 
03:28:09.429 --> 03:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
money when in fact it's it's vaporware
 
03:28:10.990 --> 03:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
right but then on the other hand there
 
03:28:13.670 --> 03:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
are like well established sure and to
 
03:28:15.910 --> 03:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
get from startup phase to the well
 
03:28:17.429 --> 03:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
established phase we want to make sure
 
03:28:19.990 --> 03:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're not uh blocking a legitimate path
 
03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
to you know sure see what I mean we
 
03:28:24.110 --> 03:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
could talk more about it yeah we can
 
03:28:25.070 --> 03:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
talk more about it I think we could
 
03:28:26.469 --> 03:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
probably solve it with a definition of
 
03:28:28.990 --> 03:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
proprietary that like narrowly ta tailor
 
03:28:31.429 --> 03:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
what we mean by proprietary to a very
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
specific set of circumstances um that
 
03:28:36.110 --> 03:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
would alleviate your
 
03:28:37.830 --> 03:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
concerns we're already doing an
 
03:28:39.710 --> 03:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
amendment because your your proprietary
 
03:28:42.429 --> 03:28:42.439 align:start position:0%
is that it it was theirs yeah it's the
 
03:28:45.150 --> 03:28:45.160 align:start position:0%
comp the money transmitter in questions
 
03:28:47.790 --> 03:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
right that's not and now we're talking
 
03:28:49.550 --> 03:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
about is that it really does have
 
03:28:52.389 --> 03:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
underlying value potentially it wouldn't
 
03:28:54.550 --> 03:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily the proprietary could have
 
03:28:57.870 --> 03:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
underlying value it's it is is how do
 
03:28:59.870 --> 03:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
you how do you measure the value how do
 
03:29:02.349 --> 03:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
you know right there's no Stock Exchange
 
03:29:02.359 --> 03:29:03.229 align:start position:0%
you know right there's no Stock Exchange
there's

03:29:03.229 --> 03:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:29:07.269 --> 03:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
no way to to reference whether that
 
03:29:10.750 --> 03:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
particular yeah has value map out the
 
03:29:12.590 --> 03:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
difference use cases that are out there
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
in the in the wild and see which ones so
 
03:29:18.469 --> 03:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
lots of exchanges issue their own tokens
 
03:29:20.910 --> 03:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
like binance has its own token right uh
 
03:29:22.110 --> 03:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
you know there's lots of them that issue
 
03:29:23.630 --> 03:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
it and they use it to incentivize
 
03:29:26.590 --> 03:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
certain Behavior what what FTX was doing
 
03:29:29.950 --> 03:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
was lending based on the value of that
 
03:29:31.670 --> 03:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
token sort of creating like a Ponzi
 
03:29:34.750 --> 03:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
scheme right and that's books yeah we
 
03:29:36.229 --> 03:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
don't want them inflating their own
 
03:29:38.469 --> 03:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
books artificially saying we have this
 
03:29:40.469 --> 03:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
token that's what's on our balance sheet
 
03:29:42.189 --> 03:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
and it's worth a billion dollars what
 
03:29:44.469 --> 03:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
it's really worth you know whatever um
 
03:29:45.870 --> 03:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
so my only concern is that we don't
 
03:29:48.189 --> 03:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
block legitimate Innovation right sure
 
03:29:50.990 --> 03:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
right but I'm but I'm intrigued because
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
it it's the devil's in the details it's
 
03:29:55.830 --> 03:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
the words it's like you know documented
 
03:29:59.670 --> 03:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
value or proven value or you know again
 
03:30:01.950 --> 03:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
it's not proprietary it's it's that you
 
03:30:06.070 --> 03:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
can had evidentiary accountant appr it
 
03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
evaluation value third party third party
 
03:30:12.389 --> 03:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the value you I mean I
 
03:30:16.990 --> 03:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
mean yeah that's um Direction so it has
 
03:30:19.269 --> 03:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
to be some way it's documented or Prov
 
03:30:20.790 --> 03:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
proven or independent auditor
 
03:30:24.349 --> 03:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
independently a independently approved I
 
03:30:26.269 --> 03:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
think the concern is even more specific
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
for us it's that they have their own
 
03:30:30.790 --> 03:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency and they're using it on
 
03:30:33.110 --> 03:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
their own books to inflate the value of
 
03:30:37.150 --> 03:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
their business whereas I think we don't
 
03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
want to stifle them
 
03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
from perhaps investing in other forms of
 
03:30:44.830 --> 03:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency that are on the market
 
03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
and valued so but that wouldn't be
 
03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
proprietary that was there that's an
 
03:30:51.469 --> 03:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
investment and that's a a balance sheet
 
03:30:53.309 --> 03:30:53.319 align:start position:0%
item but at the end of the day the only
 
03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
thing you got is the the
 
03:30:58.710 --> 03:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
auditor is going to audit the value is
 
03:31:00.750 --> 03:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
going to be look at the books and it has
 
03:31:03.950 --> 03:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
to be on an audited financial statement
 
03:31:05.910 --> 03:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
has to be an independent audited
 
03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
financial statement are you following
 
03:31:08.950 --> 03:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
along with this I'm trying to look at my
 
03:31:10.710 --> 03:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
money transmitter would that be the way
 
03:31:13.950 --> 03:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
to it has to be has to be documented on
 
03:31:15.630 --> 03:31:15.640 align:start position:0%
an audited
 
03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
statement yeah so the the financial
 
03:31:20.550 --> 03:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
statements are audited as part of this
 
03:31:24.349 --> 03:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
um license so it had to be by certified
 
03:31:26.189 --> 03:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
accountant auditing yeah let us think
 
03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
about it I I I think I understand that
 
03:31:29.630 --> 03:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
sounds like a good way to do I just
 
03:31:31.590 --> 03:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
didn't want to leave it with that's you
 
03:31:33.189 --> 03:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
know think of it I want to get a little
 
03:31:34.510 --> 03:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
more we've already been in touch with
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
representative am and preliminarily on
 
03:31:37.630 --> 03:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
this issue so I think with a little
 
03:31:39.429 --> 03:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
further discussion we could like figure
 
03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
it out narrow it down your concern is
 
03:31:43.830 --> 03:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
legitimate absolutely um yeah but the
 
03:31:45.870 --> 03:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
word proprietary was intentionally added
 
03:31:47.309 --> 03:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
and there's no real definition to it so
 
03:31:48.590 --> 03:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah proprietary was just
 
03:31:50.349 --> 03:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
meant that the company made it
 
03:31:51.870 --> 03:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
themselves and they invented their own
 
03:31:53.910 --> 03:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
value right that's what that's that's
 
03:31:55.630 --> 03:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
what I you know so you could you could
 
03:31:58.590 --> 03:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
go into definitions and and say what
 
03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
proprietary meant and then and clarify
 
03:32:03.910 --> 03:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
it it's not proprietary to somebody else
 
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
proprietary could mean we're saying that
 
03:32:09.269 --> 03:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
it's unaudited and has has it
 
03:32:11.710 --> 03:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
supposition rather than really
 
03:32:14.229 --> 03:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
yeah some third party auditor has
 
03:32:16.269 --> 03:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
approved that this value is really there
 
03:32:17.550 --> 03:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
let me let me think about that a little
 
03:32:19.309 --> 03:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
bit more and we'll work on it okay all
 
03:32:21.110 --> 03:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
right you still have a question Chris
 
03:32:21.120 --> 03:32:22.469 align:start position:0%
right you still have a question Chris
yeah

03:32:22.469 --> 03:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
just um this is part of the issue I have
 
03:32:30.790 --> 03:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
with uh if you go and look up
 
03:32:33.429 --> 03:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
definitions of crypto and youd ask the
 
03:32:35.950 --> 03:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve what it is and they'll
 
03:32:39.189 --> 03:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
say it's it's currency and then you go
 
03:32:42.269 --> 03:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
to the SEC and they say it's a
 
03:32:44.429 --> 03:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
commodity and then you go to somebody
 
03:32:46.670 --> 03:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
else and who says it's
 
03:32:50.349 --> 03:32:50.359 align:start position:0%
currency nobody res I I looked it up
 
03:32:52.469 --> 03:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
they couldn't have said it's currency
 
03:32:56.510 --> 03:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
money it's money they use it as currency
 
03:32:59.349 --> 03:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
when when when the bank went down in
 
03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
California they bailed
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
out uh the uh people that owned their
 
03:33:08.550 --> 03:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
crypto that were Bank in the bank okay
 
03:33:10.189 --> 03:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that's supposed to be
 
03:33:12.550 --> 03:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
gold or met or maybe it's something like
 
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
a commodity the SEC said commodity okay
 
03:33:19.790 --> 03:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
well I you know so I that's an
 
03:33:21.750 --> 03:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
interesting commodity they had in those
 
03:33:23.790 --> 03:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
Banks because it was hundreds of
 
03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
thousands of millions of dollars of I
 
03:33:29.790 --> 03:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
think it was paper probably or digital
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
but the point I'm trying to make is that
 
03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
this was presented to me as
 
03:33:41.990 --> 03:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that was uh specifically uh
 
03:33:44.590 --> 03:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
you know trying to make a distinction
 
03:33:46.710 --> 03:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
between the big guys and the small guys
 
03:33:48.910 --> 03:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to money transmitting
 
03:33:51.030 --> 03:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way I look that was a
 
03:33:53.710 --> 03:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
small part of issue of this legislation
 
03:33:55.910 --> 03:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
well I I thought this issue is about how
 
03:33:59.750 --> 03:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
we regulate and audit uh people who are
 
03:34:01.790 --> 03:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
in the business of transmitting money
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
okay the first the first opening
 
03:34:05.309 --> 03:34:05.319 align:start position:0%
statements here were about the
 
03:34:07.510 --> 03:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
distinction between the large guys and
 
03:34:09.910 --> 03:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
and the smaller transmitters that was
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
what was discussed right off the that
 
03:34:14.630 --> 03:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
would have been the Peter right Peter so
 
03:34:17.349 --> 03:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
anyway that was his little issue but but
 
03:34:21.630 --> 03:34:21.640 align:start position:0%
but the thing is my point is that we
 
03:34:26.830 --> 03:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
have um have had a ton of
 
03:34:29.389 --> 03:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency related
 
03:34:33.429 --> 03:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
legislation that I think a lot of it is
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
not anywhere
 
03:34:38.550 --> 03:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
near uh defined well thank you you know
 
03:34:41.309 --> 03:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
I mean Trump said you know this property
 
03:34:42.910 --> 03:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
was worth $2
 
03:34:45.389 --> 03:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
billion right now you're going off on
 
03:34:48.469 --> 03:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
the tent well okay the tangent is and
 
03:34:50.309 --> 03:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what you're talking
 
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
about she's the the commissioner is
 
03:34:57.550 --> 03:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
saying I don't have uh a tool uh in
 
03:35:02.189 --> 03:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
order to uh functionally tell you what
 
03:35:05.309 --> 03:35:05.319 align:start position:0%
uh no she's saying is that we all agree
 
03:35:07.750 --> 03:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
is that we want to make sure we do have
 
03:35:10.910 --> 03:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
an independent audit value that is not
 
03:35:13.309 --> 03:35:13.319 align:start position:0%
something that you just say you know be
 
03:35:15.269 --> 03:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
like Trump and just wing it and say this
 
03:35:16.910 --> 03:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
is what he thinks it's really worth okay
 
03:35:19.309 --> 03:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
I want I I my question is can you give
 
03:35:23.469 --> 03:35:23.479 align:start position:0%
me an example of a specific commodity or
 
03:35:26.550 --> 03:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
currency or whatever the hell crypto is
 
03:35:29.189 --> 03:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
and and and and value it so in other
 
03:35:31.630 --> 03:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
words somebody comes in and okay well I
 
03:35:32.990 --> 03:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
can give you here's what I'm saying
 
03:35:35.110 --> 03:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
right now I know what Bitcoin is because
 
03:35:37.630 --> 03:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
I just saw what happened in the last two
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
days with Bitcoin okay okay but that's a
 
03:35:42.990 --> 03:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
third part that the third party is the
 
03:35:44.910 --> 03:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
free market that is valuing with that
 
03:35:48.030 --> 03:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
bitcoin's value is okay and it's on the
 
03:35:50.309 --> 03:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
exchange so you can you know buy and
 
03:35:53.110 --> 03:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
sell the exchange that's a commodity
 
03:35:56.110 --> 03:35:56.120 align:start position:0%
okay that's like stock okay you know
 
03:35:58.429 --> 03:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is if someone
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
is issuing a Bitcoin and giving it to
 
03:36:04.110 --> 03:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
employees or giving it to somebody and
 
03:36:06.309 --> 03:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
saying this is what it's
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
worth but that it really didn't had any
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
underlying transactional value I
 
03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
understand that that's casino chips so
 
03:36:19.950 --> 03:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
the thing is um if you if you if the
 
03:36:22.870 --> 03:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
banking department is is a little
 
03:36:27.030 --> 03:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
confused or not quite sure of how to
 
03:36:30.269 --> 03:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
define uh this no we all know what we're
 
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get at these are money Transit
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
we all know what we want to label it we
 
03:36:35.189 --> 03:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
just got to figure out what is the right
 
03:36:37.349 --> 03:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
word so are we transmitting money or are
 
03:36:40.550 --> 03:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
we transporting coal this is someone's
 
03:36:42.870 --> 03:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
value that they put on their portfolio
 
03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
their stock they they're account in
 
03:36:46.910 --> 03:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
dollars or in crypto in the end of the
 
03:36:49.469 --> 03:36:49.479 align:start position:0%
day it's being translated to dollars
 
03:36:51.150 --> 03:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
because that's the way when you file
 
03:36:53.070 --> 03:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
your tax return when you file your
 
03:36:55.590 --> 03:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
annual report everything is in dollars
 
03:36:58.070 --> 03:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
so the issue was when they put that
 
03:37:01.110 --> 03:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
number I mean here's the classic example
 
03:37:04.990 --> 03:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
is inventory okay and you are what are
 
03:37:07.269 --> 03:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
you going to value your inventory at are
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
you going to value at what you actually
 
03:37:11.389 --> 03:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
paid for it or are you going to valuate
 
03:37:12.870 --> 03:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
what it's going to what it would be
 
03:37:16.670 --> 03:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
worth when you sell it okay and so
 
03:37:20.630 --> 03:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
theoretically you have to is what that's
 
03:37:23.070 --> 03:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
the point the inventory in this case
 
03:37:24.990 --> 03:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
yeah is the
 
03:37:27.910 --> 03:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
coin but and so therefore somebody would
 
03:37:29.670 --> 03:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
put on his books and say oh yeah this is
 
03:37:29.680 --> 03:37:31.189 align:start position:0%
put on his books and say oh yeah this is
worth

03:37:31.189 --> 03:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
worth
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
$100,000 but it really wasn't worth
 
03:37:36.550 --> 03:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
$100,000 has no value $100,000 there's
 
03:37:39.269 --> 03:37:39.279 align:start position:0%
no there's no way to claim it back and
 
03:37:41.269 --> 03:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
say that com it's going to give you
 
03:37:43.830 --> 03:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
$100,000 for that value of what's there
 
03:37:47.150 --> 03:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm stumbling over the phrase money
 
03:37:49.070 --> 03:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
transmitter and the fact the money
 
03:37:52.269 --> 03:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
transmitter is the category in which we
 
03:37:54.910 --> 03:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
as as legislature have accounted to the
 
03:37:58.110 --> 03:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
the banking department and uh one of
 
03:38:00.750 --> 03:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
their activities that they regulate is
 
03:38:00.760 --> 03:38:02.150 align:start position:0%
their activities that they regulate is
money

03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:38:04.630 --> 03:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
transmitters and so therefore case one
 
03:38:06.309 --> 03:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
of the things we care about those money
 
03:38:09.189 --> 03:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
transits is what is their balance sheet
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
03:38:13.990 --> 03:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay and the balance sheet what we're
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
worried about here is is somebody's
 
03:38:18.750 --> 03:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
making up bake numbers on their balance
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
sheet yeah I consider crypto all fake
 
03:38:23.790 --> 03:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
but the but the thing of the matter is
 
03:38:26.950 --> 03:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
they are they are they are able to right
 
03:38:29.150 --> 03:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
Chris we got a lot to go here today can
 
03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
I just say one General go ahead so in
 
03:38:35.550 --> 03:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
2017 uh we Exempted virtual currency
 
03:38:38.349 --> 03:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
from the money transmitter laws 399 G
 
03:38:40.110 --> 03:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
that came through this committee and
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
went to a commission with appointees by
 
03:38:44.349 --> 03:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
the governor and then a bill came
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
through and the governor signed it in
 
03:38:48.389 --> 03:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
2017 that specifically Exempted roal
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
currency this is a rewrite of that
 
03:38:52.349 --> 03:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
entire statute based on model law
 
03:38:53.910 --> 03:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
correct and we're trying to preserve
 
03:38:55.830 --> 03:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
that same advantage that we had
 
03:38:58.910 --> 03:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
established in 2017 and not slide
 
03:39:00.750 --> 03:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
backwards on it that's that's really
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely correct okay all
 
03:39:06.630 --> 03:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
right moving on to
 
03:39:08.830 --> 03:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
1441 all right relative to local
 
03:39:12.030 --> 03:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
regulation of digital money
 
03:39:14.429 --> 03:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
so the amendment Keith that you had it's
 
03:39:16.710 --> 03:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
being printed yeah so your amendment is
 
03:39:16.720 --> 03:39:18.229 align:start position:0%
being printed yeah so your amendment is
about

03:39:18.229 --> 03:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:39:21.150 --> 03:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
um it's I spent it out last night right
 
03:39:23.950 --> 03:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
but in terms of not with understanding
 
03:39:26.309 --> 03:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
that it it say about no one can ra you
 
03:39:26.319 --> 03:39:27.309 align:start position:0%
that it it say about no one can ra you
know

03:39:27.309 --> 03:39:27.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:39:30.389 --> 03:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
legislatively uh regulated but that if
 
03:39:32.229 --> 03:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
someone were to they would have to say
 
03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding this law right if we
 
03:39:38.469 --> 03:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
were to pass it so the first question is
 
03:39:40.469 --> 03:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
that is this is this prophylactic
 
03:39:42.670 --> 03:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
legislation that we're we're saying is
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
no no one can regulate it when nobody
 
03:39:48.349 --> 03:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
has done it yet you're keep closing the
 
03:39:50.269 --> 03:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
barn door before the horse is
 
03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
out is that what what you're going with
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
it it it establishes
 
03:39:59.349 --> 03:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
ownership uh and it's it's uh it would
 
03:40:01.469 --> 03:40:01.479 align:start position:0%
coincide with uccc article 12 that we
 
03:40:04.030 --> 03:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
just passed it has to do with self-
 
03:40:07.150 --> 03:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
custody and it would have the state uh
 
03:40:08.710 --> 03:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
the state would recognize that self-
 
03:40:11.710 --> 03:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
custody is is ownership of
 
03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
property and the original Bill had to do
 
03:40:17.469 --> 03:40:17.479 align:start position:0%
with Mining and local noise ordinances
 
03:40:20.229 --> 03:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
right right because our state energy
 
03:40:22.389 --> 03:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
costs are so high nobody's doing mining
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it would be crazy so
 
03:40:27.269 --> 03:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
that bill that bill is very prophylactic
 
03:40:29.670 --> 03:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
replace this would replace that and and
 
03:40:31.710 --> 03:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
refocus it on the fact so like if you
 
03:40:33.870 --> 03:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
have cash under your mattress you own
 
03:40:36.309 --> 03:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
that cash right that's self- custody you
 
03:40:37.830 --> 03:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
can do the same thing with digital
 
03:40:40.670 --> 03:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
assets and and correct my proposed
 
03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
amendment and it's just for discussion
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not married to it the sponsor of the
 
03:40:46.790 --> 03:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
original bill is on board uh other
 
03:40:48.510 --> 03:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
states are going in that direction it
 
03:40:50.309 --> 03:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
could be something that we that we do
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
for this bill did I is this the one I
 
03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
sent you what did I send you did you had
 
03:40:56.429 --> 03:40:56.439 align:start position:0%
another amendment on something
 
03:40:58.750 --> 03:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
else yeah and that one's like that's the
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
next bill and that's even more farfield
 
03:41:03.750 --> 03:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
we'll get to it okay that's the
 
03:41:07.269 --> 03:41:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.349 --> 03:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
final it should be coming down from the
 
03:41:11.550 --> 03:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
fourth floor um I think Carri was going
 
03:41:12.510 --> 03:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
to go get
 
03:41:15.950 --> 03:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
it question yes I sent it to the
 
03:41:17.670 --> 03:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
committee last
 
03:41:17.680 --> 03:41:19.349 align:start position:0%
committee last
night

03:41:19.349 --> 03:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
night
 
03:41:21.790 --> 03:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
so this is just a question right because
 
03:41:26.110 --> 03:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
I've never seen this before and just now
 
03:41:30.389 --> 03:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to use these Assets in
 
03:41:32.070 --> 03:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
payment for for something like if I
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to buy a house and I and somebody
 
03:41:36.389 --> 03:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
was willing to take Bitcoin to the house
 
03:41:38.790 --> 03:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
I should be able to do that and actually
 
03:41:40.510 --> 03:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
I should be able to do that anyway way
 
03:41:42.750 --> 03:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
right Keith Keith Murphy you can get a
 
03:41:44.429 --> 03:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
drink I'm
 
03:41:47.790 --> 03:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
sorry Murphy's bar you can be well
 
03:41:49.269 --> 03:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
that's that's the question that I'm
 
03:41:51.389 --> 03:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
asking we're not forcing anybody to take
 
03:41:53.910 --> 03:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
it no it's just that the state wouldn't
 
03:41:56.510 --> 03:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
the state would respect self- custody of
 
03:41:58.309 --> 03:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
digital assets and that's what the gist
 
03:42:00.070 --> 03:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
of the B and we're not asking the state
 
03:42:01.990 --> 03:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
we're not asking the state that they
 
03:42:03.870 --> 03:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
have to take it in payment for any weird
 
03:42:05.950 --> 03:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
thing okay that's fine then no we
 
03:42:10.269 --> 03:42:10.279 align:start position:0%
learned that lesson already yeah so okay
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
all right so we let's wait till that
 
03:42:14.590 --> 03:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment comes down okay so now we'll
 
03:42:17.550 --> 03:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
move on to Innovative Financial this is
 
03:42:20.469 --> 03:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
sween's Bill right
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay I have a lot of comments on this
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
one we're now on 1507 because we're GNA
 
03:42:29.750 --> 03:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're wait till 1444 the amendment comes
 
03:42:32.910 --> 03:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
down I have this one coming down too but
 
03:42:34.189 --> 03:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
this is up to you whatever you want to
 
03:42:36.429 --> 03:42:36.439 align:start position:0%
do we could just skip it if you want
 
03:42:38.309 --> 03:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
well I I did send this to the the
 
03:42:40.510 --> 03:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner and you have any comments
 
03:42:42.870 --> 03:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
about it great come on come on up and
 
03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
tell us
 
03:42:46.269 --> 03:42:46.279 align:start position:0%
what could I just interject before you
 
03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
start the the language and the committee
 
03:42:52.229 --> 03:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
hasn't seen this language yet so it'll
 
03:42:54.590 --> 03:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
be but it's it's almost word for word
 
03:42:56.950 --> 03:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
what's already Statute in Connecticut
 
03:42:59.510 --> 03:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
right so whether it fits our statutes or
 
03:43:01.790 --> 03:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
not that's a different question but yeah
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
right I just understand what's a bank
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
that doesn't loan money what's the
 
03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of a bank if you don't Lo money
 
03:43:08.950 --> 03:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
payment processor okay is it a payment
 
03:43:08.960 --> 03:43:11.030 align:start position:0%
payment processor okay is it a payment
processor

03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
processor
 
03:43:13.349 --> 03:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
and so I guess my so I obviously got
 
03:43:15.550 --> 03:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
this at a a.m. this morning I sent it to
 
03:43:17.950 --> 03:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
my team to look at we did some
 
03:43:20.309 --> 03:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
preliminary spitballing but I H I would
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
need some more time with it um first my
 
03:43:25.590 --> 03:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
first thought was which is I think what
 
03:43:27.269 --> 03:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
I said I think this was a bill that you
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
worked on maybe before the legislative
 
03:43:30.830 --> 03:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
cycle started and then you ended up not
 
03:43:35.429 --> 03:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
doing it um but my first kind of thought
 
03:43:39.070 --> 03:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
was I think what's being described could
 
03:43:42.670 --> 03:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
potentially fit under our trust Charter
 
03:43:44.590 --> 03:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
or it could depending on how they set it
 
03:43:47.070 --> 03:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
up or it could fit as a money
 
03:43:50.030 --> 03:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
transmitter so I don't think but again
 
03:43:52.510 --> 03:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not really clear on exactly what
 
03:43:54.429 --> 03:43:54.439 align:start position:0%
we're trying to capture but if it's a
 
03:43:54.439 --> 03:43:55.469 align:start position:0%
we're trying to capture but if it's a
payment

03:43:55.469 --> 03:43:55.479 align:start position:0%
payment
 
03:43:58.349 --> 03:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
processor those sometimes are money
 
03:44:02.309 --> 03:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
transmitters um if it's somebody who is
 
03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
um we've had companies approach us who
 
03:44:07.710 --> 03:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
are essentially money transmitters for
 
03:44:10.309 --> 03:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
businessto business money transmission
 
03:44:12.309 --> 03:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
and they keep all of those assets that
 
03:44:14.710 --> 03:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
they're transmitting in custody accounts
 
03:44:17.870 --> 03:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's a trust company so I I strongly
 
03:44:21.630 --> 03:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
suspect that this type of entity um
 
03:44:23.750 --> 03:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
without knowing more details could fit
 
03:44:25.269 --> 03:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
under one of our current regimes and you
 
03:44:30.309 --> 03:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:36.830 --> 03:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
1507 a lot
 
03:44:38.760 --> 03:44:41.269 align:start position:0%
1507 a lot
question

03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:44:42.630 --> 03:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
so and
 
03:44:45.990 --> 03:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
I'm so we're looking at
 
03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:48.070 align:start position:0%
I'm so we're looking at
um

03:44:48.070 --> 03:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:48.080 --> 03:44:53.910 align:start position:0%
um
2734

03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:57.429 --> 03:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
this's and let's do this soal
 
03:44:59.510 --> 03:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
Innovative do you by any chance have a
 
03:45:03.670 --> 03:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:06.110 --> 03:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
um you have an extra one no I think I
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
got 10 printed you can have
 
03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:10.870 align:start position:0%
got 10 printed you can have
mine

03:45:10.870 --> 03:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
mine
 
03:45:13.550 --> 03:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
sand sand this would be in L of the
 
03:45:16.590 --> 03:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
sandbox in yeah it would be like
 
03:45:20.389 --> 03:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
you um I called it not non- lending
 
03:45:20.399 --> 03:45:21.950 align:start position:0%
you um I called it not non- lending
payment

03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
payment
 
03:45:24.229 --> 03:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
bank I have a question
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
do is not this legislation based on
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
legislation in another state or other
 
03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
states if I recall non- lending payment
 
03:45:34.110 --> 03:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
bank or the Innovative sandbox this the
 
03:45:36.510 --> 03:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
sandbox the both both are in other
 
03:45:39.149 --> 03:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
states I'm sorry both are in both are in
 
03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:45.110 --> 03:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
one's AR okay one is in many other so
 
03:45:47.110 --> 03:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
the sandbox concept has been done in
 
03:45:48.910 --> 03:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
several other states with varying
 
03:45:51.510 --> 03:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
degrees of activity and success that's
 
03:45:53.670 --> 03:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
what the public hearing what we provide
 
03:45:57.149 --> 03:45:57.159 align:start position:0%
testimony about the the the item that I
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
believe is circulating is something
 
03:46:03.670 --> 03:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:06.510 --> 03:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
Sandbox it's yeah it's representative
 
03:46:08.189 --> 03:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
Ammon has submitted it so this would be
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
something that would come out of the box
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
this would be like yeah like something
 
03:46:16.950 --> 03:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
that could a niche uh Charter type that
 
03:46:19.670 --> 03:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
could be in the sandbox so this is like
 
03:46:19.680 --> 03:46:20.550 align:start position:0%
could be in the sandbox so this is like
very

03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:46:23.950 --> 03:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
specific so so question are are we
 
03:46:26.710 --> 03:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
eliminating the sandbox and then just
 
03:46:27.990 --> 03:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
going we're just talking we're just
 
03:46:31.389 --> 03:46:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:35.309 --> 03:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
talking okay so um why don't we go back
 
03:46:38.110 --> 03:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
to why we get more copies of this
 
03:46:39.950 --> 03:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
language why don't we get back back to
 
03:46:42.110 --> 03:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
the sandbox so you might want to stay
 
03:46:43.389 --> 03:46:43.399 align:start position:0%
there right because you have strong
 
03:46:46.030 --> 03:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
opinions about The Sandbox yeah I can I
 
03:46:48.070 --> 03:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
can rehash any of the I talked about in
 
03:46:49.590 --> 03:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
the public hearing if you'd like yeah
 
03:46:51.670 --> 03:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
why well just tell us whether you love
 
03:46:52.870 --> 03:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
it or hate
 
03:46:57.590 --> 03:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
it um I'm not wild about it um but I
 
03:46:59.910 --> 03:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
could the bill as proposed would take a
 
03:47:02.269 --> 03:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
lot of work to create a Sandbox that I
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
think would work the primary issue is we
 
03:47:06.269 --> 03:47:06.279 align:start position:0%
did not get a fiscal note and if you
 
03:47:08.670 --> 03:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
wanted the sandbox set up the way it is
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
I think I said I would need three at
 
03:47:12.550 --> 03:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
least three maybe four staff members out
 
03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the gate to set it up an attorney an
 
03:47:17.309 --> 03:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
investigator and an administrator that
 
03:47:19.710 --> 03:47:19.720 align:start position:0%
was pretty killer that's pretty killer
 
03:47:22.990 --> 03:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and then I also like think about
 
03:47:26.990 --> 03:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
the fun the practicality of a Sandbox um
 
03:47:30.229 --> 03:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
generally um from what I understand for
 
03:47:32.189 --> 03:47:32.199 align:start position:0%
financial services sandbox there's lots
 
03:47:33.269 --> 03:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
of different
 
03:47:35.670 --> 03:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
sandboxes um but for a financial
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
services sandbox generally people are
 
03:47:40.750 --> 03:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
hesitant to enter the sandbox because
 
03:47:42.429 --> 03:47:42.439 align:start position:0%
any application they submit to be part
 
03:47:44.950 --> 03:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
of the sandbox would become public so
 
03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
their um Innovative Financial product
 
03:47:48.910 --> 03:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
much for being a secret corate secret
 
03:47:50.910 --> 03:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
right exactly I think some of the things
 
03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
that were cited in earlier um hearings
 
03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
or in other sandboxes were things that
 
03:47:57.950 --> 03:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
were not so much financial sector
 
03:47:59.030 --> 03:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
related I mean maybe there was a
 
03:48:01.389 --> 03:48:01.399 align:start position:0%
regulatory component to them but it was
 
03:48:05.590 --> 03:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
more outside of my purview um so I'm not
 
03:48:07.550 --> 03:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
sure there's been a lot of success of
 
03:48:10.030 --> 03:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
sandboxes for financial sector
 
03:48:11.590 --> 03:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
additionally there was a slew of other
 
03:48:13.830 --> 03:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill as it was drafted
 
03:48:16.870 --> 03:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
um for example um entities subject to
 
03:48:19.830 --> 03:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
the banking Department's uh jurisdiction
 
03:48:21.750 --> 03:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
are exempt from the consumer protection
 
03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
act because we can get restitution for
 
03:48:25.910 --> 03:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
consumers it wasn't really clear if
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
somebody who was in the sandbox would be
 
03:48:29.790 --> 03:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
in that position or not um I had some
 
03:48:31.269 --> 03:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
concerns about how it was drafted with
 
03:48:33.269 --> 03:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
regard to Consumer harm while somebody
 
03:48:34.590 --> 03:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
was operating in a
 
03:48:37.149 --> 03:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
sandbox um there were just a lot of
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
little needly things like that that
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
would need to be um really carefully
 
03:48:43.110 --> 03:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
looked at um before it could go forward
 
03:48:45.710 --> 03:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
in my opinion so and you said successes
 
03:48:48.349 --> 03:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
so have some states had some success
 
03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
with this or were you just
 
03:48:53.590 --> 03:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
being I I'm only really aware of the
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
financial services one and I couldn't
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
find a really great example where they
 
03:48:58.910 --> 03:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
were like this financial services
 
03:49:01.469 --> 03:49:01.479 align:start position:0%
product came out of a Sandbox I couldn't
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
find that there were some things that
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
came out of sandbox I think one was like
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
kind of like a zip car and I was like
 
03:49:08.750 --> 03:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's not under my reg jurisdiction so
 
03:49:10.309 --> 03:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
03:49:12.070 --> 03:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah pass it around to anybody wants
 
03:49:15.269 --> 03:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
it yeah I got it I got it yes carage so
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
what I did was I looked at of course in
 
03:49:18.750 --> 03:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
that way that I have I looked at every
 
03:49:20.469 --> 03:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
single state to find out which states
 
03:49:22.189 --> 03:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
had this and what successes and who was
 
03:49:24.349 --> 03:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
in the sandbox and whoever came out of
 
03:49:26.110 --> 03:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
it and what laws came out of it every
 
03:49:28.550 --> 03:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.229 --> 03:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
them in fact there was only one
 
03:49:34.469 --> 03:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
financial success and then the sandbox
 
03:49:37.030 --> 03:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
got shut down and that was Hawaii they
 
03:49:38.830 --> 03:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
were the only ones that had an actual
 
03:49:38.840 --> 03:49:40.030 align:start position:0%
were the only ones that had an actual
Financial

03:49:40.030 --> 03:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
03:49:42.910 --> 03:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
sandbox they shut down and their
 
03:49:46.670 --> 03:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
Innovative their Innovation out of it
 
03:49:49.710 --> 03:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
was at one time they had 12 companies
 
03:49:51.469 --> 03:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
the results of the sandbox work in the
 
03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
area is that Hawaii will not apply the
 
03:49:55.110 --> 03:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
state's money transmitters act to
 
03:49:55.120 --> 03:49:56.790 align:start position:0%
state's money transmitters act to
cryptocurrency

03:49:56.790 --> 03:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency
 
03:50:01.070 --> 03:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
activities been there done that so and
 
03:50:03.870 --> 03:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
that is literally the only fin anal
 
03:50:07.950 --> 03:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
sandbox that I found in in the 12 or 14
 
03:50:09.910 --> 03:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
states that I looked at and that's all
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
there is there's ones on nursing there's
 
03:50:14.830 --> 03:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
one on mining there's one on other
 
03:50:17.590 --> 03:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
things but that's it so in your search
 
03:50:20.510 --> 03:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
engine you used the term sandbox uh that
 
03:50:22.630 --> 03:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
was one of them but I also used final
 
03:50:25.429 --> 03:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
Financial I used regulatory I
 
03:50:29.469 --> 03:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
used regulatory sandbox okay they're
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
usually called sand sandboxes is a good
 
03:50:34.269 --> 03:50:34.279 align:start position:0%
a good guess that's where I would start
 
03:50:36.110 --> 03:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
too although I would what I did find
 
03:50:39.070 --> 03:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
that was urban urban what I did find no
 
03:50:41.910 --> 03:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
that not usually I did find one thing
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
that made me a little
 
03:50:44.399 --> 03:50:46.030 align:start position:0%
that made me a little
nervous

03:50:46.030 --> 03:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
nervous
 
03:50:49.269 --> 03:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency Publications were adver
 
03:50:51.950 --> 03:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
advocating the use of sandboxes as a way
 
03:50:55.269 --> 03:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
to get around State legislation but
 
03:50:57.469 --> 03:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
nobody was picking them up on
 
03:51:01.790 --> 03:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
it oh it's the web page he saw so you
 
03:51:03.750 --> 03:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
know that's about the only thing I saw
 
03:51:05.429 --> 03:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
with with respect to anything financial
 
03:51:08.149 --> 03:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
and that's it
 
03:51:08.159 --> 03:51:13.349 align:start position:0%
and that's it
okay1

03:51:13.349 --> 03:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:19.030 --> 03:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
who oh okay 12:41 okay
 
03:51:23.030 --> 03:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
03:51:27.750 --> 03:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
so where where are we now we're uh back
 
03:51:32.910 --> 03:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:35.790 --> 03:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
amendment can I speak yeah I don't mean
 
03:51:38.309 --> 03:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
to confuse the issue here with we had a
 
03:51:39.910 --> 03:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
conversation at T andies we were talking
 
03:51:43.070 --> 03:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
about this bill right um and and I
 
03:51:44.790 --> 03:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned that I almost filed this bill
 
03:51:45.990 --> 03:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
but I pulled it at the last minute
 
03:51:47.710 --> 03:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
because I didn't know I thought it would
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
be too much right um the the issue is
 
03:51:53.149 --> 03:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
State chartered banks that are
 
03:51:56.550 --> 03:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
non-lending that would like to get a uh
 
03:51:58.030 --> 03:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
an account with the Federal Reserve a
 
03:51:59.870 --> 03:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
master account with the Federal Reserve
 
03:52:01.830 --> 03:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
and there's currently a lawsuit with
 
03:52:04.950 --> 03:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
custodia bank out of Wyoming uh that
 
03:52:06.229 --> 03:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
they're a state Chartered bank and the
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
FED is refusing to give them a master
 
03:52:11.229 --> 03:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
account because they're not FDI FDIC
 
03:52:13.030 --> 03:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
insured and they don't need to be
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
because they don't lend they're more of
 
03:52:17.469 --> 03:52:17.479 align:start position:0%
a payment processor or custodian of of
 
03:52:18.670 --> 03:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
assets they're not doing fractional
 
03:52:22.750 --> 03:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
Reserve Banking and so that lawsuit is
 
03:52:25.469 --> 03:52:25.479 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be settled later this month
 
03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
or potentially April uh by a panel of
 
03:52:30.630 --> 03:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
Judges if it goes the way of custodia
 
03:52:32.469 --> 03:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
bank it's going to open up uh
 
03:52:35.349 --> 03:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
potentially a new you know in in the
 
03:52:38.990 --> 03:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
financial services space a new uh demand
 
03:52:43.110 --> 03:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
demand for that type of um Charter and
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
the states that have it on the books are
 
03:52:47.870 --> 03:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
where those institutions are going to go
 
03:52:50.309 --> 03:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
Connecticut has it on the books um I
 
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
think Maine and Vermont also have have
 
03:52:54.070 --> 03:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
it on the books similarly but this
 
03:52:55.710 --> 03:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
language is lifted right from
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
Connecticut statutes and it gives the
 
03:53:00.990 --> 03:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
banking commissioner the authority to
 
03:53:05.070 --> 03:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
approve or or not approve based on uh
 
03:53:08.189 --> 03:53:08.199 align:start position:0%
certain you know parameters in the bill
 
03:53:09.510 --> 03:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just throwing it out there for
 
03:53:11.910 --> 03:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
conversation maybe it's you know maybe
 
03:53:14.790 --> 03:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's something we look at later but
 
03:53:17.590 --> 03:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
um you know it is sort of like a an
 
03:53:19.950 --> 03:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
issue in the fintech space that may be
 
03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
resolved federally very soon in State's
 
03:53:25.110 --> 03:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
favor and we know we want to preserve
 
03:53:26.630 --> 03:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
State sovereignty in chartering Banks
 
03:53:30.269 --> 03:53:30.279 align:start position:0%
and this would be so if it resolves in
 
03:53:33.030 --> 03:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
custodia favor and custodia is indeed
 
03:53:35.550 --> 03:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
only doing custody work which is not
 
03:53:36.670 --> 03:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
totally clear to me because I went on
 
03:53:38.309 --> 03:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
their website and they were advertising
 
03:53:40.429 --> 03:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
that they hold people's deposits which
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
is a whole different animal um in my
 
03:53:44.550 --> 03:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
opinion if you have an entity that's
 
03:53:47.590 --> 03:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
holding people's money I'm a I believe
 
03:53:49.510 --> 03:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
that we need FDIC insurance for that
 
03:53:51.710 --> 03:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
because custodia seems and now I'm not
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
an expert on custodia but just looking
 
03:53:56.550 --> 03:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
at this since 8 A.M this morning um it
 
03:53:58.830 --> 03:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
looked to me like they were advertising
 
03:54:01.870 --> 03:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
that they do business customers and they
 
03:54:05.149 --> 03:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
want to hold deposits for businesses
 
03:54:07.510 --> 03:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
which is what our banks do currently but
 
03:54:10.469 --> 03:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
they don't have FDIC insurance and
 
03:54:13.389 --> 03:54:13.399 align:start position:0%
there's been um a you may be familiar
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
with recent bank failures where they
 
03:54:17.469 --> 03:54:17.479 align:start position:0%
were most of their customers were
 
03:54:20.030 --> 03:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
businesses um and when they failed it
 
03:54:22.149 --> 03:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
was really important that they had FDIC
 
03:54:23.830 --> 03:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
insurance that was really critical now
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about a bank that's
 
03:54:27.950 --> 03:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
truly doing custody or money or money
 
03:54:30.269 --> 03:54:30.279 align:start position:0%
transmission I think that if it goes
 
03:54:33.149 --> 03:54:33.159 align:start position:0%
custodia way and they can get a Fed um
 
03:54:35.830 --> 03:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
payment account you could potentially
 
03:54:38.349 --> 03:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
have a non-depository Trust Company
 
03:54:40.030 --> 03:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
doing that at work and holding those
 
03:54:42.790 --> 03:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
funds in custody and perhaps be able to
 
03:54:44.510 --> 03:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
access the FED payment system so I don't
 
03:54:46.870 --> 03:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
think that's a barrier um under current
 
03:54:48.349 --> 03:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
law like I don't I don't think you need
 
03:54:51.429 --> 03:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
this if that's your goal okay and so I I
 
03:54:54.349 --> 03:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
believe custodia is uh licensed in New
 
03:54:57.149 --> 03:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to do business to do money I
 
03:54:59.950 --> 03:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
don't know we'd have to look into that I
 
03:55:02.950 --> 03:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
don't they if they're chartered in
 
03:55:05.590 --> 03:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
Wyoming that I don't know how that
 
03:55:07.910 --> 03:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
reciprocity would work we do they have a
 
03:55:09.550 --> 03:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
money transmitter license to so they
 
03:55:09.560 --> 03:55:10.790 align:start position:0%
money transmitter license to so they
have

03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:55:12.910 --> 03:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
them oh they'd be exempt because they'd
 
03:55:14.229 --> 03:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
be a state bank we would need to look
 
03:55:15.910 --> 03:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
into that a little bit let me confer
 
03:55:18.750 --> 03:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
with my folks so however it works out we
 
03:55:21.950 --> 03:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
we don't want to have a like a a homec
 
03:55:23.550 --> 03:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
court disadvantage where I don't think
 
03:55:25.510 --> 03:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
you would based on what I'm hearing you
 
03:55:27.510 --> 03:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
say all right um I don't think you need
 
03:55:29.550 --> 03:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
this to do what you're suggesting all
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
right thank you but it could bear a
 
03:55:34.149 --> 03:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
little more looking at okay and I'm just
 
03:55:35.910 --> 03:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
a little confused if I could ask a
 
03:55:39.030 --> 03:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
question so so why would they need FDI I
 
03:55:42.590 --> 03:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
see maybe they're holding Securities not
 
03:55:44.830 --> 03:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
just general deposits I don't I don't
 
03:55:46.750 --> 03:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
know all the details a very
 
03:55:48.670 --> 03:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
preliminarily looked at their website
 
03:55:51.550 --> 03:55:51.560 align:start position:0%
this morning and it did say deposits but
 
03:55:53.349 --> 03:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not I haven't had a lot of time to
 
03:55:56.030 --> 03:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
dig into it if they're holding deposits
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
that would make them like a bank and
 
03:55:59.870 --> 03:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
those deposits would be on their books
 
03:56:01.710 --> 03:56:01.720 align:start position:0%
not like a custody account that the
 
03:56:03.710 --> 03:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
custody accounts are not on their books
 
03:56:07.710 --> 03:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:09.309 align:start position:0%
 
distinction

03:56:09.309 --> 03:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
03:56:09.319 --> 03:56:13.670 align:start position:0%
distinction
okay

03:56:13.670 --> 03:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
so all
 
03:56:18.830 --> 03:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
right what do you want to do with these
 
03:56:21.790 --> 03:56:21.800 align:start position:0%
bills I mean I to me is I mean
 
03:56:23.429 --> 03:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
everything here is is all very
 
03:56:25.389 --> 03:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
interesting intriguing but I'm not sure
 
03:56:29.349 --> 03:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
any of them are are really ready to to
 
03:56:31.469 --> 03:56:31.479 align:start position:0%
uh be passed whether we should just keep
 
03:56:33.030 --> 03:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
them as interim study and keep working
 
03:56:35.229 --> 03:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
on these things you know so they'd be
 
03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
ready for legislation for next year but
 
03:56:40.070 --> 03:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of the your the cryptocurrency
 
03:56:41.590 --> 03:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
digital ass said do you feel differently
 
03:56:44.389 --> 03:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
about that one so 1444 I know we haven't
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
really talked about the amendment yet I
 
03:56:49.149 --> 03:56:49.159 align:start position:0%
have more focused I think that's more uh
 
03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time and the and the
 
03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
sandbox the self custody one talking
 
03:56:55.149 --> 03:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
about yeah okay but you know it's a it's
 
03:56:56.429 --> 03:56:56.439 align:start position:0%
a work session so that's what we're
 
03:57:00.910 --> 03:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
right okay so um so let's talk let's go
 
03:57:03.309 --> 03:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
back to 1444 now that we have copies of
 
03:57:06.309 --> 03:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
it so
 
03:57:09.750 --> 03:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
um we get past I I have a feel like I
 
03:57:11.630 --> 03:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
have a pile in front of me who needs a
 
03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:37.600 --> 03:57:52.110 align:start position:0%
 
1444

03:57:52.110 --> 03:57:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:54.269 --> 03:57:54.279 align:start position:0%
want just speak to it for yeah briefly
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
so the the meat of the bill is on first
 
03:58:00.229 --> 03:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
page line 26 the right to self- custody
 
03:58:01.469 --> 03:58:01.479 align:start position:0%
and it says the state of New Hampshire
 
03:58:02.990 --> 03:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
shall not prohibit restrict or otherwise
 
03:58:04.750 --> 03:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
impair the ability of an individual or
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
business from doing two things accepting
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
digital assets as pay for the purchase
 
03:58:12.710 --> 03:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
of legal goods or services or using
 
03:58:14.309 --> 03:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
prevent them from using self- custody
 
03:58:16.710 --> 03:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
digital assets by use of a self-hosted
 
03:58:18.309 --> 03:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
wallet Hardware wallet or by any other
 
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
means that allow the individuals to
 
03:58:22.269 --> 03:58:22.279 align:start position:0%
retain individual control over the digal
 
03:58:24.030 --> 03:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
assets that's really the gist of the
 
03:58:27.070 --> 03:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
bill the rest is uh
 
03:58:27.080 --> 03:58:28.630 align:start position:0%
bill the rest is uh
definitions

03:58:28.630 --> 03:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
03:58:32.349 --> 03:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
yeah that's how we how many copies do we
 
03:58:36.189 --> 03:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
make yeah I have did did we make did
 
03:58:42.110 --> 03:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:45.149 --> 03:58:45.159 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah the banking
 
03:58:48.550 --> 03:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
Department yeah I know I I I we're we're
 
03:58:50.110 --> 03:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
bouncing back and forth between these
 
03:58:54.189 --> 03:58:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:54.199 --> 03:58:57.269 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:58:57.269 --> 03:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:59.910 --> 03:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
crypto so it could be a stable coin
 
03:59:01.229 --> 03:59:01.239 align:start position:0%
that's backed by dollars that would be a
 
03:59:04.189 --> 03:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
digital asset but it could be is
 
03:59:06.670 --> 03:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
that uh that's a really big question
 
03:59:09.950 --> 03:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
that no one's really answered yet so
 
03:59:13.510 --> 03:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
there they won't answer that
 
03:59:21.550 --> 03:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:25.110 --> 03:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
listing now I don't know if that has to
 
03:59:31.870 --> 03:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:34.309 --> 03:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
Nita thanks um represent I have a
 
03:59:37.670 --> 03:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
question for you so does this no longer
 
03:59:39.990 --> 03:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
relate to digital mining at
 
03:59:42.590 --> 03:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
all yeah this would be a full
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
replacement we totally ditch that
 
03:59:45.710 --> 03:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
because it's not really happening in our
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
state because our energy costs are so
 
03:59:49.269 --> 03:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
high like that's one thing we learned
 
03:59:50.910 --> 03:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
with the governor's commission is they
 
03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
go to Texas they go to places where so
 
03:59:54.670 --> 03:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
this is a completely new bill a
 
03:59:56.990 --> 03:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
different subject yeah well related but
 
03:59:59.030 --> 03:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay yeah separate but
 
04:00:01.950 --> 04:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
equal yeah my first reaction was that we
 
04:00:04.110 --> 04:00:04.120 align:start position:0%
might have to have a non-ring Amendment
 
04:00:07.189 --> 04:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
hearing on this but I guess what what
 
04:00:08.910 --> 04:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
I'm focusing on just that section you're
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
talking about is that that this is this
 
04:00:15.630 --> 04:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
felt like a barn door because you're
 
04:00:17.389 --> 04:00:17.399 align:start position:0%
there's nobody right now that has
 
04:00:20.429 --> 04:00:20.439 align:start position:0%
there's no statute now so did your
 
04:00:22.389 --> 04:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
commission talk about this bill at all
 
04:00:25.030 --> 04:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
did they ever have we talked about self-
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
custody that that it was important to
 
04:00:28.870 --> 04:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
that the state recognize it and this
 
04:00:29.990 --> 04:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is what accomplished that
 
04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish I can't I can't present this
 
04:00:34.030 --> 04:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
as a recommendation from the commission
 
04:00:37.349 --> 04:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
but that's a section of the report that
 
04:00:39.389 --> 04:00:39.399 align:start position:0%
right to to reaffirm confirm that it is
 
04:00:42.349 --> 04:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
okay to to have this in and then you if
 
04:00:44.309 --> 04:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
you can find a willing party to
 
04:00:46.830 --> 04:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
negotiate something you could use this
 
04:00:48.389 --> 04:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
yeah it just recognizes that it's
 
04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
private property basically okay uh a
 
04:00:55.510 --> 04:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
question yes um and thisy representative
 
04:00:59.469 --> 04:00:59.479 align:start position:0%
am does this is this sort of a separate
 
04:01:01.950 --> 04:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
bill that maybe would have come out of
 
04:01:05.149 --> 04:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
the sandbox and we look at this bill and
 
04:01:06.990 --> 04:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
just can the sandbox
 
04:01:09.870 --> 04:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
Bill uh that applies to the different
 
04:01:11.349 --> 04:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
bill yeah we're going we went back a
 
04:01:12.590 --> 04:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill so we're going back and forth
 
04:01:15.110 --> 04:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
between bills yeah this is a this goes
 
04:01:17.630 --> 04:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
back to the crypto commission okay the
 
04:01:20.830 --> 04:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
original bill was uh 1444 the original
 
04:01:23.149 --> 04:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
bill was about local ordinances against
 
04:01:26.110 --> 04:01:26.120 align:start position:0%
mining of digital assets and since
 
04:01:27.229 --> 04:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
that's not really happening like that
 
04:01:29.990 --> 04:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
would be super profil but there is self-
 
04:01:31.189 --> 04:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
custody happening in our state and this
 
04:01:35.389 --> 04:01:35.399 align:start position:0%
would recognize it a question okay so
 
04:01:39.510 --> 04:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
represent spear this thank you uh
 
04:01:43.590 --> 04:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
so uh this this self uh custody have we
 
04:01:45.870 --> 04:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
got incidences where people are are not
 
04:01:49.750 --> 04:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
being allowed to uh maintain custody or
 
04:01:52.990 --> 04:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
being allowed that that you could have a
 
04:01:54.990 --> 04:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
transaction like the one I described
 
04:01:56.790 --> 04:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
where I want to buy a house and and I
 
04:01:59.990 --> 04:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
have agreement on both sides to use
 
04:02:02.550 --> 04:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin uh that somebody's preventing
 
04:02:04.030 --> 04:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
them from doing
 
04:02:08.030 --> 04:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
that yes so really no no no I didn't say
 
04:02:13.189 --> 04:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
yes I was saying yeah really um so you
 
04:02:15.750 --> 04:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary transactions are legal in New
 
04:02:17.229 --> 04:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people are buying houses for
 
04:02:20.590 --> 04:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin um the realtor that sold me my
 
04:02:23.830 --> 04:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
house specializes in that actually um
 
04:02:25.950 --> 04:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
and I did not buy my house with Bitcoin
 
04:02:28.630 --> 04:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
um this would this has to do with uh
 
04:02:30.590 --> 04:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
have holding digital assets that you're
 
04:02:32.790 --> 04:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
recognized as that the state won't
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
interfere with your owning the digital
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
assets what would that interference that
 
04:02:41.269 --> 04:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
this has actually been a problem okay
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
but could you even say what that might
 
04:02:45.030 --> 04:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
look like this is this is prophylactic
 
04:02:47.070 --> 04:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
this is this is closing the barn door
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
before the horse got out so you can't
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
describe a situation where this could
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
happen that we yeah we're just we're
 
04:02:55.910 --> 04:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
just making sure that no no no one ever
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
said you can't you can't do that okay
 
04:03:00.389 --> 04:03:00.399 align:start position:0%
because I couldn't picture what it would
 
04:03:02.830 --> 04:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
look like okay right is that correct
 
04:03:05.070 --> 04:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
recognizing ownership it's recognizing
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the ownership exists right right
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
that that it that you could so okay so
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
that that would be not prop that would
 
04:03:16.630 --> 04:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
be saying is that yes which you but it
 
04:03:18.189 --> 04:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
is what you think it
 
04:03:23.110 --> 04:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
is and you're okay to think that I have
 
04:03:27.110 --> 04:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
question I know I know uh that the uh
 
04:03:31.110 --> 04:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
the crypto industry and and its
 
04:03:34.269 --> 04:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
supporters do not like the idea of a
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
national the the Federal currency what
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
is it no what is it called it's a f
 
04:03:44.910 --> 04:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
digital because of the fact that you're
 
04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
concerned about seeing them they can go
 
04:03:50.750 --> 04:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
right into the digital currency and
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
check digal what's going on digital
 
04:03:52.840 --> 04:03:55.550 align:start position:0%
check digal what's going on digital
assets

04:03:55.550 --> 04:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
assets
 
04:03:58.110 --> 04:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
so we're g to we're going to make that
 
04:04:00.030 --> 04:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
legal here in the state of New
 
04:04:03.630 --> 04:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but the federal government
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
can't do
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
it uh I mean I don't understand your
 
04:04:11.429 --> 04:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
question trying yeah I don't understand
 
04:04:13.550 --> 04:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
the answer so
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh so but it but it is confusing enough
 
04:04:21.149 --> 04:04:21.159 align:start position:0%
to me to go with have a red flag go up
 
04:04:23.389 --> 04:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
okay and say if I can't understand it so
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
anytime we talking about crypto you your
 
04:04:27.389 --> 04:04:27.399 align:start position:0%
red flag goes up yes yeah I know a lot
 
04:04:31.110 --> 04:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
about crypto May sure you do if if if
 
04:04:32.790 --> 04:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's up the subcommittee if the
 
04:04:35.510 --> 04:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee decides of course um maybe
 
04:04:37.790 --> 04:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
we have a hearing on just this amendment
 
04:04:40.510 --> 04:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
the the prime sponsor is on board with
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
this change okay and and maybe we flesh
 
04:04:46.229 --> 04:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
out the the issues then and uh and then
 
04:04:48.870 --> 04:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
we decide right like okaying well the
 
04:04:51.309 --> 04:04:51.319 align:start position:0%
problem yeah the problem is is I was
 
04:04:53.630 --> 04:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
evidently um thinking that we had all
 
04:04:55.830 --> 04:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
this time in the world but it turns out
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
the the speaker is bound and determine
 
04:05:00.750 --> 04:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
to have a session every Thursday so now
 
04:05:03.469 --> 04:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have uh image so
 
04:05:05.710 --> 04:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
now that leaves and then next Tuesday's
 
04:05:08.429 --> 04:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
town meeting day which we can't meet so
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
that means we have next
 
04:05:14.710 --> 04:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and then we have the following
 
04:05:17.710 --> 04:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
week we have Tuesday Wednesday and
 
04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
Thursday every Everything has to be out
 
04:05:23.630 --> 04:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
of committee so so Wednesday next week
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
from Wednesday we have to be done with
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
everything so if we're going to have a
 
04:05:30.149 --> 04:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
hearing and then try to figure out a
 
04:05:32.510 --> 04:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um we're we're very tight
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
on time here I think this should be next
 
04:05:39.950 --> 04:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:42.269 --> 04:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
right so have you guys have any
 
04:05:44.550 --> 04:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
perspective about this bill and like
 
04:05:47.950 --> 04:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
anything that you could see might be a
 
04:05:51.229 --> 04:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
problem or not be a
 
04:05:53.870 --> 04:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
problem so we were talking internally we
 
04:05:55.590 --> 04:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
want to have our the chief Bank examiner
 
04:05:56.750 --> 04:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
look at this just to make sure there's
 
04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
no impact on banks for safety and
 
04:06:02.030 --> 04:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
sadness my just very like I just saw
 
04:06:03.950 --> 04:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
this right now so I'm spitballing really
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
this is a work session please let me
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
come back and correct the record if I'm
 
04:06:07.199 --> 04:06:08.550 align:start position:0%
come back and correct the record if I'm
incorrect

04:06:08.550 --> 04:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
04:06:10.910 --> 04:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make sure there's
 
04:06:13.710 --> 04:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
nothing that forces somebody to take
 
04:06:15.990 --> 04:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency like one of our I don't
 
04:06:18.110 --> 04:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
think it says that but I just want to
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
Noodle it around in my head a little bit
 
04:06:24.630 --> 04:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
um so that would be it because we don't
 
04:06:26.349 --> 04:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
currently regulate like if you want to
 
04:06:27.870 --> 04:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
take your crypto and go buy something
 
04:06:30.550 --> 04:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
with it and the person takes the crypto
 
04:06:33.309 --> 04:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
that's not nobody right that was that's
 
04:06:35.710 --> 04:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
that was the resolution of our of our
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
sandbox 201 yes
 
04:06:42.790 --> 04:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:46.269 --> 04:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
preliminary so uh one suggestion is to
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
go back through the crypto report and
 
04:06:49.349 --> 04:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
search for self- custody and the
 
04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
discussion around that uh and you know
 
04:06:55.229 --> 04:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
this is definitely related to those
 
04:06:57.630 --> 04:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
discussions I can not hear you're saying
 
04:06:59.590 --> 04:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
I think that things if you if you just a
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion if you go back to the
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
2022 uh commission report there are
 
04:07:06.189 --> 04:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
sections that talk about self custody I
 
04:07:07.830 --> 04:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
do remember that yeah so this would be
 
04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
need to refresh my recollection about it
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
and I want I was on that committee I sat
 
04:07:14.429 --> 04:07:14.439 align:start position:0%
in almost every hearing I just want to
 
04:07:15.790 --> 04:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
just double check
 
04:07:19.189 --> 04:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
myself right but so the upshot is is if
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a public hearing on
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
it we have to have it next week John
 
04:07:26.550 --> 04:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
this is it is it it would be a non-gain
 
04:07:28.830 --> 04:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment it would be a non- gerain
 
04:07:28.840 --> 04:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
Amendment it would be a non- gerain
Amendment

04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.720 --> 04:07:40.710 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:07:40.710 --> 04:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:43.229 --> 04:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
yeah this is I know you were you because
 
04:07:46.510 --> 04:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
you this was this B fall in
 
04:07:49.229 --> 04:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
right all right so
 
04:07:52.149 --> 04:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
um I guess we should just interim study
 
04:07:53.790 --> 04:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
these next two B these two
 
04:07:57.389 --> 04:07:57.399 align:start position:0%
bills you okay with that I think this
 
04:07:59.349 --> 04:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
one's pretty simple but yeah no it is
 
04:08:01.950 --> 04:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
simple but just the timing is timing's
 
04:08:06.429 --> 04:08:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:21.550 --> 04:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:30.030 --> 04:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
