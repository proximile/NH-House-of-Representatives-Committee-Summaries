00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
from a 2020 analysis of the army
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
national guard the health of the force
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
and when you look at that analysis on
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
the next four pages you will see that
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire army national guard
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
ranks 45th
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
out of 54 in the country in a bad way
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
for the health of our force
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
and there are many reasons why
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
when you look at it the two primary
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
reasons they call it on that report
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
is obviously hearing loss
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
which is predicated on the fact that it
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
is a army national guard we have a lot
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
of what's called field artillery
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
but more importantly
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
hazardous alcohol misuse
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
so when you look at the data 7.9 of our
 
00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:51.430 align:start position:0%
so when you look at the data 7.9 of our
force

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
force
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
has a possibility of
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
hazardous alcohol misuse
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
this is a pilot program initiative that
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
we hope
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
will provide or reduce stressors to
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
military families in order to provide
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
child care and drill weekends for our
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
the last piece of information in that
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
handout talks about i think it was my
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
letter to the fiscal committee
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
clarifying some of the reasons why
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
so the governor's commission on balcony
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
other drugs voted on this initiative i
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
think last march
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
and like i said we're one of eight um
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
sub task force on that commission
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
um based upon this committee's request
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
patrick tufts the chair of the
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
governor's commission of alcohol and
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
other drugs is also here
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
and by the way there's also ancillary
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
benefits of this initiative you know as
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
we look holistically across our force
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know one of our one of our sort of
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
um reasons also is diversity and
 
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.310 align:start position:0%
um reasons also is diversity and
inclusion

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
inclusion
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
we continue to lose our female
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
servicemen and our female service women
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
based on the lack of child care
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
so for example at the peas air national
 
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.189 align:start position:0%
so for example at the peas air national
guard

00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
guard
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
our female service
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
service women composed 29 of our force
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
when they initially enlist
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
at the end of a 20-year
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
20-year career that percentage goes down
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
to 15 percent
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
during the process of a 29-year career
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
our female service women have to make
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
the decision whether they want to
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
continue with their service or they want
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
to raise a family
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
this is a significant issue for us for
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
our retention our ability to have a
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
diverse and inclusive workforce
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
primarily it's for the stressors
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
associated with family life
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's a single family parent
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
a single family a parent whether it's a
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
dual family parent where both parents
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
serve in the military or whereas their
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
significant other their spouse as a
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
second job
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
so we require three quarters of our
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
service members come in for that week
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
and a month because we're a part-time
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
force this is the reason why
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions that's all i
 
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.470 align:start position:0%
subject to your questions that's all i
have

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
did you uh want mr tufts to come and say
 
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.190 align:start position:0%
did you uh want mr tufts to come and say
anything

00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members thank you
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
general um
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
as stated my name is patrick tufts i'm
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
the chair of the governor's commission
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
on alcohol and other drugs i just want
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
to add a couple of things to the
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
general's presentation
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
this particular investment is part of a
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
much broader investment in prevention
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
services a roughly 4.5 million dollar
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
investment in prevention programs all
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
across the state of new hampshire that
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission has made
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
as part of its expanding our resources
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
action plan i've left copies on the
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
table for any of you who haven't seen it
 
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
this is the 2001 governor's commission
 
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.669 align:start position:0%
this is the 2001 governor's commission
strategic

00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
strategic
 
00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:44.950 align:start position:0%
strategic
plan

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
this particular program is an important
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
part of again this broader portfolio of
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
investments for all the reasons that the
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
general just stated our service members
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
endure additional stress and additional
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
hardships additional
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
complications in their lives especially
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
when they're deployed child care
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
services and access to good child care
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
services play a critical role in getting
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
our kids off to a good start and
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
reducing the stress on the parents
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
there were questions about the
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
evidence-based best practices again all
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
the child care programs in the state of
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire do adhere to
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
evidence-based best practices this is a
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
pilot program so we can't bring evidence
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
in right now as to what the outcomes of
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
this are but this particular investment
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
was heavily cooperative with the
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
prevention task force of the governor's
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
commission it was co-developed with the
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
prevention task force and it really has
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
an emphasis on reducing aces or adverse
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences and really
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
addressing the social indicators that we
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
have to have in place for healthy kids
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
and healthy families so
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
while this is a new program to the guard
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
and a new effort it really is tightly
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
embedded in our prevention efforts as a
 
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.870 align:start position:0%
embedded in our prevention efforts as a
state

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
and tightly connected to our strategic
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
plan from the governor's commission so
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time this morning if
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
you have any particular questions i'd be
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
happy to answer
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
are there
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair
 
00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.190 align:start position:0%
thank you very much madam chair
general

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
give me an indication of the number of
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
deployments made by the national guard
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
let's say over the past 12 months
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
and how we've dealt with those as they
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
relate to the child care situation and
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
the alcohol problem that seems to
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
emanate from this situation
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh senator i'm saying in the last 12
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
months we have had probably three to
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
four hundred soldiers in air been
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
deployed overseas whether it's uh
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
southwest border kosovo the middle east
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
afghanistan um
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
we're averaging about three to four
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
hundred soldiers per year um and airmen
 
00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:52.230 align:start position:0%
hundred soldiers per year um and airmen
activated

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
activated
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
for the question yes please follow up
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you general
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's important for all of us to
 
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.549 align:start position:0%
i think it's important for all of us to
realize

00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
realize
 
00:20:58.559 --> 00:20:59.590 align:start position:0%
realize
that

00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
the guard plays a much more significant
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
role in our military obligations than in
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
and that these deployments sometimes are
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
our extended periods of time
 
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.750 align:start position:0%
our extended periods of time
uh

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's male and female who gets deployed
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
so the mother may get deploy the father
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
made it
 
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.230 align:start position:0%
made it
and

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.029 align:start position:0%
and
just

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
comment on the alcohol problem the
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol situation i noticed that was
 
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.990 align:start position:0%
alcohol situation i noticed that was
mentioned

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
in your narrative
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
thanks senator so again um but we
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
believe the this is potentially
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
affecting over 200 of our soldiers uh
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
and airmen when you look at 7.9 of about
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
2 800 uniformed service members um
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
this is somewhat significant i mean when
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
you see that we're 45th out of 54 um in
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
the nation we stood up a wellness
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
division in our organization using
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
federal resources to bring in a wellness
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
director a dietitian a personal trainer
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
a financial counselor and we're trying
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
to get after the whole holistic sort of
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
wellness program this is just a piece of
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
the pie that we're trying to get after
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
we have an issue we acknowledge it and
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
this is where we think we can make a
 
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.590 align:start position:0%
this is where we think we can make a
difference

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you general
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your service and
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
your commitment a manchester central
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
graduate graduate of the united states
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
military academy at west point
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
and by the way a good greek boy from
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative leitchman you have a
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
question thanks madam
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
chair knowing that he's greek i guess
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
you have the senator's support
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh just one question and thanks for
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
how many service members do you think
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
would take advantage of this program
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
um senator we're estimating
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 200 250 families would
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald do you have a question
 
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
i do thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
um my question's really for mr tufts
 
00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:15.909 align:start position:0%
um my question's really for mr tufts
um

00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
this seems like a creative solution and
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if the governor's
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
commission has experience from other
 
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.549 align:start position:0%
commission has experience from other
states

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
of using child care as a tool to prevent
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
substance use
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
disorders and and more broadly whether
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
that for other populations in new
 
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.110 align:start position:0%
that for other populations in new
hampshire

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh some of the best evidence we've seen
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
senator is actually from the business
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
community who's making heavy investments
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
in child care to strengthen and
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
reinforce their own workforces i think
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
this particular program is really
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
cutting edge i haven't seen it done with
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
other guard units across the nation but
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
we're starting to see a
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
increased understanding that child care
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
is a critical part of keeping not just
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
children on the right track but also
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
keeping the family healthy and
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think that we can continue to look at
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know what the business community is
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
doing as a real
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
parallel comparison to um what we're
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
trying to do here but this this is a new
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
program and it's relatively innovative i
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
think it's something that other states
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
are going to want to copy when they see
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards uh thank you
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair um
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
for the record i i i'm a 33-year army
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
veteran i've deployed uh i appreciate
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
the need for this program i i do have
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
some questions i'd like to just get some
 
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.870 align:start position:0%
some questions i'd like to just get some
clarity

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
as i understand that this program is uh
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
intended to be
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
uh set up on the weekends it's not a
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
it's not a seven day program it's a
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
every weekend program is that true
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
initially it's going to be just a week
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
and a month or maybe two weeks during
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
the annual training and training period
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
so it's just
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's to get after the 70 of our force
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
that are part time so two weeks annual
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
training uh week in a month
 
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.630 align:start position:0%
training uh week in a month
uh

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you follow-up
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
um okay so i
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
when i was in the army uh we could uh
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
violate privacy rights uh we we would
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
have been able to have sort of a by-name
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
roster of the 7.9 percent
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
that we think are at risk of
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse and then we would be able
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
to set up this program so that we could
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
see exactly who was using it because
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
we would hope that there's some kind of
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
correlation between those at risk and
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
those using the program and i'm just
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
curious since this is meant to be an
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
evidence-based program the extent to
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
which you guys are mapping
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh the need to the use
 
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.029 align:start position:0%
uh the need to the use
uh

00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
a great question representative based
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
upon the funding we have to do a
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
pre-imposed survey of the soldiers and
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
airmen usually utilizing this program so
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
that pre-survey would include you know
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh you know just a questionnaire
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
about you know these are the things
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking after like is there a
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
stress in your life is this a in an in
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
post survey the year later
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
for in the subsequent years later to go
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
after the post survey to look at that
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
data and say did this make an impact or
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay so what i think i heard you say
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
general uh i don't want to misinterpret
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
you i i it sounds to me like you're
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
saying you don't have anything like a by
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
name list now
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
of the 7.9 percent who may be considered
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
abusing alcohol
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's a hipaa violation
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
so we don't track we don't distract we
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
we get the raw data that 7.9
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
based upon surveys taken during periodic
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
health assessments as we do our annual
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
medical training
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
when those soldiers and service members
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
are in question on an annual basis
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and you know just
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
the issue it becomes like suicidal
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
ideations and you know substance abuse
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
so that's how we
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh one last one um
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
are you finding in your data um that
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction between male and
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
female propensity to abuse alcohol
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing that there's a great
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
retention opportunity for the female
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
side of the force and i get that i think
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
that's great i'm just curious if if we
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
think the female side of the force
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
is is at much at risk of alcohol abuse
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
is the male side do you see any
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
differences uh
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
so the data tends to say that uh males
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
age 21 and 25 have a higher propensity
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
for uh hazardous alcohol misuse i think
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's on one of the pages i handed out if
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
not i can get you that information
 
00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:05.029 align:start position:0%
not i can get you that information
specifically

00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions oh
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry senator gaida
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
general thank you for coming today can
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
you provide a metric on like the number
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
of days
 
00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:18.230 align:start position:0%
of days
lost

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
lost
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.510 align:start position:0%
because of
alcohol

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
misuse or
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps parental you know not having a
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
babysitter at home obviously you must
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
have absence absence data that you're
 
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.590 align:start position:0%
have absence absence data that you're
tracking

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
tracking
 
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.549 align:start position:0%
tracking
yeah

00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
yes i'll have to get back to you on that
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
i i think we have that data
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate it
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
senator daniels thank you
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
good morning general
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh i have one question
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
if you could give clarification to the
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
initial statement that you
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
said that 7.9 had the possibility
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
of hazardous
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
alcohol use
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh to me that's analogous to saying that
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
20 of the people driving cars have the
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
having an accident it really doesn't
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
tell me anything
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
with the word possibility in there i
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
would say potentially wouldn't 100
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
percent have the possibility
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
of hazardous alcohol abuse
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
based upon annual periodic health
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
assessments of which our soldiers fill
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
out a survey for their you know like
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
do you smoke cigarettes do you chew
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
tobacco do you drink alcohol on a
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
frequency of alcohol how often do you
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
drink alcohol per week or per month
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
based upon that data 7.9 percent of our
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
force has indicated that they have a
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
hazardous alcohol use issue
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%

where everybody
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
yes this year currently the usda has a
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
waiver for free meals that is set to
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
expire on june 30th of this year 2022.
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
and and so these dollars will get us
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
through the 30th of june on the free and
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
red on
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
everyone receiving meals
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
no oh
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
okay that's not a good answer
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
when we did an initial assessment we
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
were using the state new hampshire first
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
system and looking at the expenses that
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
had been spent to date when we looked
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
into our food and nutrition systems
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
subsystem we found that we
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
have not paid out
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
expenses for november and december
 
00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:53.110 align:start position:0%
expenses for november and december
so

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
these funds that we are accepting in
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
today will get us through those and into
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
january we we plan to come back again
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
next month because we've done in another
 
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.230 align:start position:0%
next month because we've done in another
analysis

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
and we will be bringing another item
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
before you next month
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
so the federal government is paying
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's not the problem it's
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
um when we built this budget two years
 
00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:18.710 align:start position:0%
um when we built this budget two years
ago

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
we did not anticipate covet in the the
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
changes in the guidance from the federal
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
government so because they're giving out
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
we we
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
are like doubling our reimbursement

success
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
what is the success metric
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
that you're using to determine the
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
so as you can see um
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
in the requested action in front of you
 
00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.990 align:start position:0%
in the requested action in front of you
that

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
the increase this year and the free
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
meals compared to the years before is
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
highly successful
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're currently using
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
the claiming
 
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.069 align:start position:0%
the claiming
system

00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
each school claims the amount of meals
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
that they have served and
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
this year since the meals are free there
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
is a significant increase which is why
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
we are requesting more money additional
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
money follow-up follow-up
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh does anybody track how much of the
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
food is thrown away
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
at this time that is not tracked at the
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
and just a couple days ago i read of
 
00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:10.950 align:start position:0%
and just a couple days ago i read of
some

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
online complaints from
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
parents who
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
posted pictures of the
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
lunches that schools
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
that particular school was handing out
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
and the parents saying that wasn't not
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
nearly enough so these are why i'm
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
asking these questions is if we're just
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
saying success is based upon the number
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
that we throw out
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that's really the
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
correct metric because i hear often
 
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.349 align:start position:0%
correct metric because i hear often
about

00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
how much of the food is thrown away by
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
students and
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
then this this was new to me that
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
that some parents were feeling that
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
their child wasn't getting enough
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
so the current usda regulations have not
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
changed as far as meal standards those
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
are still the same that we have been
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
following before
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
and the claiming process is the schools
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
do not claim meals for which they have
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
not been served to the students so every
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
meal that has been claimed is a meal
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
that has been given
 
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:11.990 align:start position:0%
that has been given
to

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
to the students so um and again the the
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
regulations that the usda has put out as
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
far as the standards are concerned are
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
are the same that they have been before
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
they're no different than has been in
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
the previous years before covid okay and
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
if i may for our clarification when i
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
talk about food being thrown away i
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't talking about the food that
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't served i'm talking about food
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
that was served that the kids won't eat
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
that they throw in the trash barrel
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately at this time the doe does
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
not collect that data once it goes to
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
the child out in the cafeteria
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
senator gaidan thank you madam chair
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
can you speak to the numbers of students
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
that are using this program
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
year over year
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
say from 1920 and or 2021 and present
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
so far in fiscal 22.
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
so um as stated before the
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that the meals are free
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
to all students and not just those
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
students that fill out the free and redo
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
application there is a significant
 
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.870 align:start position:0%
application there is a significant
increase

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
to to the meal program
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
and that is based off of the waiver for
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
this year so once the waiver expires we
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
will go back to using the free and
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
reduced applications to use determined
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
eligibility who would receive a free
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
meal or who wouldn't receive a free meal
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
in that program
 
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.030 align:start position:0%
in that program
yes

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
so there's no
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
financial criteria as far as qualifying
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
for the free and reduced lunch program
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
at this time at this time that is
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
correct that is a usda waiver that has
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
been put out for this year it was in
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
place last year and it had an extension
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
for this year and expires on the 30th of
 
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.470 align:start position:0%
for this year and expires on the 30th of
june

00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
june
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
i told you i was imagining i am so glad
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
well it's just it's just that you spend
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
good morning uh thank you for clarifying
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
that because i was kind of confused in
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
the back
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is robert
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
berry i am the department liaison
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
between the board and the department
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
mr berry thank you for taking my
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
questions as as i'm looking at this
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh i'm having a really hard time uh
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
getting a sense
 
00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.309 align:start position:0%
getting a sense
that

00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
of the extent to which this program is
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
is cooked and and ready to roll out i i
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
see that it's meant to rely on 350 000 a
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
year of user fees
 
00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.510 align:start position:0%
year of user fees
um

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
and if if you could walk us through
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh the state of collection around those
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
user fees and
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
and uh at the rate at which you're going
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
to expect to begin expending the money
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm worried about the cash flow
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
aspect of of this program i'm not seeing
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
any data in here on that
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
certainly so the board came into being
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
on july 1st of 2020.
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
since then we have been working on
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
standing it up it's an administratively
 
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.349 align:start position:0%
standing it up it's an administratively
attached

00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
attached
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
board to the department
 
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.349 align:start position:0%
board to the department
the

00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
primary purpose of receiving the funds
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
is so that the board can hire an
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
executive director to begin really
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
the process of what the board's purpose
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
is and i'm not
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
extremely well versed in the overall
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of the board it's more a
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
question for the board since i'm just a
 
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.470 align:start position:0%
question for the board since i'm just a
liaison

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
liaison
 
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
but the intent is to start receiving the
 
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
funds so that it can begin the process
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
of hiring the executive director to
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
fully stand up the board as it moves
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
you have follow-up i do have a follow-up
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
so if i
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
you won't be hiring a director
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
until after the user fees have begun
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
being collected
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore you do not anticipate a
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
cash flow problem no the board is not
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
anticipate a cash flow problem our yeah
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
cash flow flow problem at this point in
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
time we believe it it should eventually
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
be self-funded and uh the big expense is
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
going to be the executive director at
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
least in the short term um we're in the
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
process of
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
putting forth some legislation that
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
would move the executive director
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
position into an unclassified position
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
and the search
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
will begin probably sometime in the
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
spring or early summer
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
is my guess um it's in other boards
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the united states this is a
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
fairly new concept um finding an
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
executive director has proven quite
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
frankly fairly difficult uh the maryland
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh board just uh hired their executive
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
director after 18 months of existence
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
and that individual was a an attorney
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
and a pharmacist so that's a bit of a
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
unicorn in the uh
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh in the world
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
um so yes to answer your question though
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative i we do not believe there
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
will be a cash flow problem
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up uh thank you madam chair
 
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.390 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up uh thank you madam chair
um

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
i just lost the question i'm sorry
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
i think senator guida may have a similar
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
question to what i was about to ask okay
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
senator guida you have a question yes
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for your
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
testimony um
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
could you put in plain language what the
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
function of this board is
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
i will try my best as i'm not a member
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
of the board
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just a liaison but the essential
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
function of the board is to provide
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
greater transparency with drug uh
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
price uh increases or changes
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
40 000 foot view of what the board does
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
there's a greater
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
in-depth detail involves data collection
 
00:45:25.599 --> 00:45:27.030 align:start position:0%
in-depth detail involves data collection
involves

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
involves
 
00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.390 align:start position:0%
involves
developing

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
developing
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
spending targets and things like that
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not overly sure how that works it's
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
more of a function of the board
 
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.150 align:start position:0%
more of a function of the board
but

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
yeah the 40 000 foot view is to provide
 
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.510 align:start position:0%
yeah the 40 000 foot view is to provide
greater

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
greater
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions oh okay
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so uh i had heard that the
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
user fee schedule would need to be
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
approved uh by
 
00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.349 align:start position:0%
approved uh by
jalcar

00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
jalcar
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
and um and that these fees have not yet
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
been approved so so my question is you
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
know uh what's your what's your jail car
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
plan and can you navigate that without
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
an executive director in place
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh yes so the the statute 126 bb8 sets a
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
floor for
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturer fees which we can begin to
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
start collecting it's a 500 floor
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
but beginning monday there's a board
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
meeting on monday
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
soliciting public input on
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
the rules and we anticipate that they
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
might be in place as early as this
 
00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.230 align:start position:0%
might be in place as early as this
summer

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
summer
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
so we will certainly include a fee a
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
user fee assessment in that in the rules
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
for jail car approval
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh representative leitchman
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr barry for
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
taking a question or two
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
so as i read the correspondence from the
 
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.349 align:start position:0%
so as i read the correspondence from the
department

00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:46:57.359 --> 00:46:58.150 align:start position:0%
department
on

00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
page three talk about the assessment
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
that would raise approximately 350 000
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
have you
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
i got the impression you've already
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
started collecting that too
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
we have now started collecting that
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's uh we were hoping to get an
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
account so we could start collecting it
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
which is why we're here today um
 
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.190 align:start position:0%
which is why we're here today um
so

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh we have not started uh
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
sending out invoices uh once we have a
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
dedicated account to that i believe that
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
that'll happen soon after but again i
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for the board
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
because i'm i'm not a member of the
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
board just a liaison but that's my
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
understanding of the intent
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
for other questions
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
so then i look at page two and it talks
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
about other fees for other
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
different things such as
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
pharmacy managers
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
it looks like that would raise an awful
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
lot more money than the 350 000 isn't
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
that correct well right now um we've
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
identified 500 manufacturers that would
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
be subject to the 500 fee we're still in
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
of identifying who else may be subject
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the fee
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
but that's the best estimate at this
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
i guess i have one follow-up chair
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
because of other questions that have
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
previously been raised i did a deep dive
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
into what this agency is supposed this
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
new board is supposed to do
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that happened to
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
be missing from the correspondence and i
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.390 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
the representative from auburn touched
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
on this as far as rules
 
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.150 align:start position:0%
on this as far as rules
126

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
126
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
dash bb colon 6 rule
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
and it says the adoption of all fees
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
now the threshold you mentioned that's
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
the threshold which i assume that would
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
be put forward to gel car as a base
 
00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.430 align:start position:0%
be put forward to gel car as a base
limit

00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
but again the rule making as referenced
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
in your
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
letter which references colon 8
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
says shall be determined by the adoption
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
of rules which then you refer to where i
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
referred to the section i just read so
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
all fees have to go through rules before
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
any fees are adopted that's how i read
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
the statute so i
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that we're perhaps moving
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
a little too quickly because
 
00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.430 align:start position:0%
a little too quickly because
the

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
rules committee gelcar has not adopted
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
or approved any fees i don't believe for
 
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
this agency yet so matt i'm sure i think
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
this item probably should be tabled
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
until the second time those fees are
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
been approved by juncker
 
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.750 align:start position:0%
been approved by juncker
okay

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
yes i'll let you well rsa 126.
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
i apologize but i think this is
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
important rsa 126 bba
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
provides statutory authority to assess a
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
minimum fee which is what this is based
 
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.230 align:start position:0%
minimum fee which is what this is based
on

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
okay i have a motion to table
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
from representative leishman
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
second madam chair i believe that that
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh motion be out of order since uh
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
representative leishman spoke before
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
making the tabling motion like
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think according according to rules uh
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
it should be made by somebody else all
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
right i'd be glad i have no problem okay
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%

thank you man i'm chair um
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
this this question is going to come out
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
of left field a little bit and i
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
apologize you you two may not be the
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
ones to answer this but um
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious if we are anticipating
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
any use of federal funds in the coming
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
weeks that come into the fiscal
 
00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:49.910 align:start position:0%
weeks that come into the fiscal
committee

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
that would address our homeless veteran
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
population i understand we have about
 
00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.270 align:start position:0%
population i understand we have about
120

00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
120
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire veterans that are are
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
considered homeless
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh approximately 110 of them or so are
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
in transitional housing and not in
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
permanent housing and that leaves
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
around 10
 
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.390 align:start position:0%
around 10
that

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
are without any housing resources at all
 
00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:15.829 align:start position:0%
are without any housing resources at all
so

00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
so i i just want to make sure i
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
understand the priorities of dhhs these
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
things come to us one at a time as
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
they're ready to come to us
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
so uh but i would like to know the the
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
bigger picture here
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
is homeless veterans are are they a
 
00:53:31.119 --> 00:53:32.390 align:start position:0%
is homeless veterans are are they a
priority

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
priority
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative edwards i'm going to
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
invite um associate commissioner santana
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%

um good morning i'm chris santaniello um
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
right now we have a number of priorities
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
in the council on housing stability um
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
much of the dollars to end veterans
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
homelessness comes through the va
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
and so what i can do is i can follow up
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
deputy adjutant general um
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
warren perry to kind of see where some
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
of that is
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
and get back to you on that but the
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
department itself does not fund that it
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
comes through the um
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
va directly or hud directly to um
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
a program in the nashua area and easter
 
00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.589 align:start position:0%
a program in the nashua area and easter
seals

00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
seals
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay uh uh thank you for that um i i i
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what you're saying
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
where you say that most of the money
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
maybe all of the money comes through the
 
00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.309 align:start position:0%
maybe all of the money comes through the
va

00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
va
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
but um i'm i'm i'm asking uh if if all
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
of the money must come through the va do
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
we have discretion
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the dhhs to uh appropriate or to or
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
request some of this funding to
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
address a problem that's not yet been
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
solved so i will um
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
not really
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
so um the federal dollars that come to
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
the department come through the
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
continuum of care and those dollars are
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
have very specific projects um and the
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
only way you can add to those projects
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
and that funding is for an additional
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
product project such as one of the other
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
items on this the youth demonstration so
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
that is the only way we can get
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
additional dollars but i will follow up
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
also um
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
warren on the numbers because that was
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
not the numbers that we had for veteran
 
00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:34.470 align:start position:0%
not the numbers that we had for veteran
homelessness

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i think they're going to be
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
doing a new survey next week or the week
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
after so well
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have fresh data yeah the point in
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
time is um later this month so thank you

uh i have received considerable
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
expressions of concern
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
for the housing of illegals
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%

whether or not they are dealing with
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
the alleged illegal population that's
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
being brought into the state
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question senator

guidas um
our

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
state health our state refugee
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
resettlement program works with federal
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
agencies agencies that are contracted by
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government specifically for
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
refugee resettlement so our work and
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge regarding anyone who settles
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is strictly with the
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
refugee resettlement program we don't
 
00:56:54.079 --> 00:56:54.950 align:start position:0%
refugee resettlement program we don't
have

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have actually anything to do
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
with the settlement of immigrants that
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
come here legally or illegally just
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
strictly the refugees
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
so our agencies are federally vetted
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
have been in business there's nine
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
national federal agencies that work and
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
then they have subsets in local
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
districts and ours have been working
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
we've been working with ours for over 20
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
years as a state
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
before the program even came to dhhs so
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
highly vetted regulated by the federal
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
government working simply with the
 
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.789 align:start position:0%
government working simply with the
refugees

00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
refugees
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up thank you madam
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
tier can you state categorically
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
that funds are
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
not being used by the agencies with
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
which you contract
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
to house illegals brought into the state
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge they are not
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
i i mean i can only speak with the
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
knowledge i have which is that they're
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
federally regulated to resettle
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
legal refugees to come through the
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
refugee resettlement program thank you
 
00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative edwards okay this one is
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so uh on on page two
 
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.309 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so uh on on page two
uh

00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
in the kind of in the middle of the big
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
paragraph um it talks about the goal of
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
achieving rapid self-sufficiency
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to read to that end
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
refugee support services funding
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
provides job development and placement
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
employment assessment
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
orientation to the american workforce
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
education training and referral services
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
employer supports and job maintenance i
 
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.270 align:start position:0%
employer supports and job maintenance i
believe

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
so so i i happen to be extremely
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with the
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
afghani culture
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to know if
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
these education programs these training
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
programs particularly as a result or
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
is dealing with employment if um there's
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
an anticipation to segregate the male
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
and female populations until they can
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
get assimilated into american society
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
generally afghani men
 
00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.390 align:start position:0%
generally afghani men
are

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
i don't want to go too far but i will
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
say the afghani men
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
tend to have
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
a 18th 17th century view of women
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
and training them in the same setting
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
can be extremely problematic and
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
inadequate to bring
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
the afghani women into
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
our culture rapidly so so would you tell
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
me if there's any anticipation to
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
segregate by gender
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
for these training classes
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative edwards
 
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.390 align:start position:0%
thank you representative edwards
um

00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
in discussing with our director of the
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
refugee resultant program
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
about this question ahead of time so
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
traditionally they are trained together
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
males and females in the refugee
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
resettlement program with the exception
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
of specific programs where there is a
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
health mental health or a cultural
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
issue or cultural historical piece that
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned so i think with the
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
agencies who have are the experts in
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
this i believe it's at their discretion
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
to determine which training programs or
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
which populations would need to be
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
segregated based on the cultural
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
differences in that society
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
so there are set ones where the genders
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
are separated as we would think with
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
physical and mental health and
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
and um situations like that and then
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
where there's a cultural difference so i
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
can't answer your question for sure
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
regarding that specific question with
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
job training with the afghans but it is
 
01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.430 align:start position:0%
job training with the afghans but it is
in

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
their purview and their expertise to
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
are there any further
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
questions let's see
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative earth
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um thank you for
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
your written responses they were
 
01:00:49.839 --> 01:00:51.109 align:start position:0%
your written responses they were
fantastic

01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
fantastic
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
and just to summarize my own benefit
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
is it fair to summarize that private
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
agencies have sole discretion in
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
choosing to resettle refugees in new
 
01:00:59.359 --> 01:01:00.390 align:start position:0%
choosing to resettle refugees in new
hampshire

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
and their consideration need not be
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
given to the costs that resettlement may
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
so they
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it's so
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
so black and white in either or they've
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
been working with these communities for
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
over 20 years in the state of new
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire mary probably might have a
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
more exact date but over 20 years
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
and they do this nationally
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
so they do work with the communities
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
there's a refugee advisory council that
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
participates in understanding what the
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities can handle as far as
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
the um cultural competencies within the
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
community within the school systems
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
within municipal municipalities excuse
 
01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:44.309 align:start position:0%
within municipal municipalities excuse
me

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
so it's not so much that they can say
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
nowhere yes it's they work together and
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
they partner and then they provide
 
01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations for what the state can
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
handle and our state generally
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
resettles a very very low number
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
relatives to the rest of the country
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
given that we are a small population of
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
rural state small urban areas
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
so it's very much done in partnership in
 
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
that way and the communities where the
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
majority of the
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
refugees resettle
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
are participate in this advisory board
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
and then it's also a conversation with
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
the governor's office as well before
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
those recommendations are made so it's
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
very much done in partnership it's not
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
a forceful situation
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%

dashboards are anticipated to be

available early february this year that
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
is my our understanding we are very
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
close to the end and um we anticipate
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
that they will be ready by february in
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
february super you know let us know when
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
so we will
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
representative senator rosenwald thank
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair good morning on page two
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
the narrative um in number four says
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
enhance the prescription drug monitoring
 
01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:37.190 align:start position:0%
enhance the prescription drug monitoring
system

01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
but i couldn't see elsewhere in the
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
narrative what those enhancements are so
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
could you please tell us what's being
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
done to the pbdmv
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for that question senator
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
so um in general the paragraph that
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
you're referring to in number four is
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
the overall work of od2a which is the
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
acronym for this particular funding
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
source opioid data to action so that's
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
what ota od2a stands for and in general
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
we provide support to the prescription
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
drug monitoring program for some of
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
their data initiatives to support that
 
01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.270 align:start position:0%
their data initiatives to support that
um

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
but with these particular funds there is
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
nothing that we are using in this fund
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
set of this carry forward to do
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
additional work for the prescription
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
drug monitoring program
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%

homeless issue with veterans and i heard
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday from a representative in
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
manchester that it's just getting worse
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
as hundreds and hundreds of homeless
 
01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.270 align:start position:0%
as hundreds and hundreds of homeless
people

01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
and i noticed
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
one of course this is a very small
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
request but
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
on page seven
 
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the supporting
 
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
documentation it talks about
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
the recipient must match all grants and
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
funds and there's
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
an exemption above but the box below is
 
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.349 align:start position:0%
an exemption above but the box below is
checked

01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
checked
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
so where is the where the recipients
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
going to get that matching
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
grant money the batch for that is built
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
into the contract that we had now have
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
with plymouth state university
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
so the vendor does provide that match
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
and just one further question if i could
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
so i turned back and looked into the
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
dashboard as far as the homelessness
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
issue and the amount of grants
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
and it's like the third page from the
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
back and there's a little
 
01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:28.229 align:start position:0%
back and there's a little
chart

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
chart
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
with i think the smallest font i've ever
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
seen but within that
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
it mentions a number of
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
homeless providers
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
and it still shows a large amount of
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
money unencumbered is that just because
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
of where we are
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
in the year or are the reasons why that
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't say that it's being
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
withheld but because of a number of
 
01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.309 align:start position:0%
withheld but because of a number of
requirements

01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
from the housing and urban development
 
01:09:00.239 --> 01:09:01.510 align:start position:0%
from the housing and urban development
agency

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
there are several phases to the
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
distribution of funds and having to make
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
frequent amendments to our contracts
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
which have to be approved as i'm sure
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know by governor and council so
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
those amendments do take a long time and
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
often the amendments are needed because
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
we don't have the confirmed award
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
amounts from hud yet to move forward
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
with them so there's a little bit of a
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
a balance if you will
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you madam chair
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you madam chair
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
has the department made any
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
um changes to shelter rates
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
since the budget was signed in june
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
we have not made changes to shelter
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
rates uh since then but we are certainly
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
in discussions about that now
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
yes so uh i believe this committee was
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
told that the department would
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
come forward
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
with a plan to do that by last september
 
01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.669 align:start position:0%
with a plan to do that by last september
um

01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
here it is
 
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.470 align:start position:0%
here it is
january

01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
january
 
01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.149 align:start position:0%
january
when

01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
when are we going to see that
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
if you would allow me to look into that
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
information and get back to you with an
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
answer i'd be more than happy to to do
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
so and
 
01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.430 align:start position:0%
so and
unless

01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
unless
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
um chris antonella for the record there
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
is actually as you are aware
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
um we can only distribute dollars based
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
on our budget there is legislation
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
actually um and if you i cannot remember
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
the actual 415 415 that would actually
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
look to add dollars to the department's
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
budget this year um directly for
 
01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.229 align:start position:0%
budget this year um directly for
shelters

01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
shelters
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
move the item
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
she can't see him through that chair no
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
that's that's not the problem it was the
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
answer that confused me uh senator guido
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair does the
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
department have any estimate of the
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
number of homeless youth that we have
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
that is one of the reasons why we're
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
moving forward with this demonstration
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
project we have
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
understand that their youth typically
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to be found so it's difficult
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
to count them
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
the last time we did a point in time
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
count was january of last year where we
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
were able to identify 46
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
in the state and that is pretty much
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
picked from the street
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
there are there's other data that the
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
department of education has i understand
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
which is quite different but i i don't
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
know the criteria or methods of
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah it would probably be a
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
good idea if you talk to doe
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
because i
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
i know what they do is
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
through the guidance counselors the
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
principles and all of those kinds of
 
01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.149 align:start position:0%
principles and all of those kinds of
things

01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:12:14.159 --> 01:12:15.189 align:start position:0%
things
they

01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's how they're obtaining that
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
information so
 
01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.229 align:start position:0%
information so
and

01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
when you mention the term 46 i
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
i said to representative emmerich that i
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
have 46 just in the town of conway so i
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
mean that number is
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't ever use that number
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay that's just my
 
01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.870 align:start position:0%
okay that's just my
comment

01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
so somebody had a question yes uh
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
represent edwards uh uh thank you uh
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair um so
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just kind of curious about the
 
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
practical implications of where this
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
program is going to make sure
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
our youth or i think they say ute in
 
01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
new jersey but
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
that our youths are taken care of i
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
imagine it's a little bit like chain
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
migration if you have a say a 15 year
 
01:13:08.239 --> 01:13:09.110 align:start position:0%
migration if you have a say a 15 year
old

01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
then it makes sense that the parents to
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
the extent they're around would also
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
receive the the benefit of of of a place
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
to stay
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm just curious how far that chain
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
migration might go would it include
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
grandparents would it include aunts and
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
uncles i i mean once you get
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
one person taken care of i'm just
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
curious how big a tail a support tail
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so this is really
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
some of the underlying purpose for this
 
01:13:43.679 --> 01:13:45.030 align:start position:0%
some of the underlying purpose for this
particular

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
project is to really to develop that
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
community plan that is subject to hud's
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
approval but the idea is to really
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
identify uh not just identify the count
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
the number of youth that are being
 
01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.229 align:start position:0%
the number of youth that are being
affected

01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
affected
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
but what are the circumstances
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
holistically around
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
that we want the youth action board that
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
is going to be created by
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
the grant to
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
identify that plan moving forward if hud
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
approves the plan then we will be
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
eligible for further federal funding to
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
implement that plan
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of this information
 
01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:22.950 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of this information
that

01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
has yet to be discovered but that is the
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.350 align:start position:0%
 
are

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
i guess i didn't get a real good answer
 
01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.470 align:start position:0%
i guess i didn't get a real good answer
to

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.719 --> 01:14:43.669 align:start position:0%
 
about

01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.030 align:start position:0%
about
when

01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.709 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
we can provide you with what we are
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursing now today to shelters the
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
department at this point does not have
 
01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.790 align:start position:0%
department at this point does not have
additional

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
funds to to pass on to shelters we had
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
there was a program through gopher this
 
01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.709 align:start position:0%
there was a program through gopher this
past

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
that ended in december where shelters
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
could apply
 
01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.750 align:start position:0%
could apply
for

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
federal dollars through gopher to cover
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
any uncovered covet related costs there
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
is a senate bill that would look to add
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
up to nine million dollars to the
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
department to directly reimburse
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
shelters but aside from that we don't
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
have additional dollars in our budget
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
senator roosevelt thank you so
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
i think we learned that the cost of a
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
shelter bed was 47
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
a day
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
and the state is reimbursing eight
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
dollars a day
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
there was a plan last year to take it to
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars a day
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
it didn't it didn't pass the budget
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
budget but the department told us they
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
would have come here with a
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
plan in august or september and
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's now january but we don't have i
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
guess the the
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
i believe um if i'm correct in that we
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
were going to apply for funding through
 
01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.470 align:start position:0%
were going to apply for funding through
gopher

01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
gopher
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
for that and instead of money to go
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
directly to shelters they are using the
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
shelter um funds that they did give to
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
shelters and that was about three
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars so we're continuing to
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
look at all of the resources and then
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
one of those resources is that senate
 
01:16:36.719 --> 01:16:39.110 align:start position:0%
one of those resources is that senate
bill

01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes you may thank you so did the
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
department ask gopher
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
for the amount of money it needed to to
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
pay a reasonable reimbursement rate and
 
01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.510 align:start position:0%
pay a reasonable reimbursement rate and
gopher

01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
gopher
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
didn't come through after the
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
legislature didn't it's it's not are we
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
what we did is we provided gopher um
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
through the council on housing stability
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
a number of strategies um to assist with
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
ending homelessness um and and
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
supporting the shelters one of those was
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
for shelter dollars and that was what
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
was given um with that one-time funding
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
i think that what senator rosenwald and
 
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
the rest of us are looking for is a plan
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
even though you don't have the money
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay that's immaterial
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for is
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
a plan yep
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
am i correct so the account
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so the council on housing stability
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
which um includes the department did
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
create a three-year strategic plan that
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
includes some of this so i will send
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
that to the full um committee
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
okay as long as long as it shows us
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
today we're paying eight dollars
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking to pay
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
30 yep
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%

given the focus on a community-based
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
care model
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
with expectation of lowered expense
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
will the review be looking at how to
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
coordinate the organizations working in
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
this space
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
and how to fill the need for employees
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
to work within this model
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
so the intent of this money is to take
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
on an evaluation of our current medicaid
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
and we've never really done a review on
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
is it fulfilling the need that we
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
originally intended it to is it saving
 
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
us money is it serving our beneficiaries
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
correctly and medicaid models have
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
evolved over the last 10 years
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
there are many different models out now
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
the intent of this money is to look at
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
our model
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
and answer those questions and determine
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
whether this is the right model
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of new hampshire is the
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
current medicaid model the right model
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of new hampshire now
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
there are several models that are
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
community-based care um
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
there are acos ccos
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
health homes all of those different
 
01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.550 align:start position:0%
health homes all of those different
models

01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
models
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that the plan is is if if
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
the determination is made that there are
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
other models that would fit better for
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that we would look at
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
those community-based models but the
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
first step is to do an assessment of our
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%

i
 
01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh i i think my my first question uh
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
really is about precedent
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh and we had asked mr uh arlinghaus is
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
is he in the room i don't think he's oh
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
there he is
 
01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:11.510 align:start position:0%
there he is
um

01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
we had asked uh him
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
if there's any precedent for the state
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
money to a private uh enterprise
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
for the for purposes similar to this i i
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
i would like to know if we're setting
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
precedent or if we have precedent that
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
we're following um
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
not not to this scale last year we uh i
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
think we
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
set aside about a 1.5 million for
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
recovery housing updates renovations
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
things like that within our state and
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
give it gave out grants to those
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
organizations to update their physical
 
01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.470 align:start position:0%
organizations to update their physical
plants

01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
plants
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
we also um with our nursing homes in
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
order to in um
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
i can't even hear myself so
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
um so um to alleviate the situation that
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
we had with our emergency departments
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
and with our hospital systems
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
we did provide
 
01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.070 align:start position:0%
we did provide
financing

01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
financing
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
of 45 000
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
a bed to nursing facilities and that was
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
agnostic to whether they were private or
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
i want to i want to ask over your
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
shoulders if mr arlingham has anything
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
um no i i looked we asked around in the
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
department and in particular joe
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
and then also mike connor who most you
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
know has been
 
01:25:49.950 --> 01:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
with us for
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
47 or eight years and nobody remembered
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
anything there's some vague thought that
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
there might have been a dental clinic
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
a very long time ago in
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
conway or somewhere up north that
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
something was tamworth
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
pamworth um
 
01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:07.669 align:start position:0%
pamworth um
but

01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
we couldn't find any any record of it
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
you know we don't know of anything but
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean there's not a first
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
time for everything
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh mr rolling house commissioner can i
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
ask a quick question
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
what is a housing finance
 
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:24.950 align:start position:0%
what is a housing finance
board

01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
low-income housing don't they provide
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
money to
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
commercial people that are constructing
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
these homes
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of low income
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a good question i don't i
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't i don't know about that but it's
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
not an item that the state has been
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
participating in before obviously the
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
bfa does things like this where they
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
give we give the money to the bfa and
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
they carry it out so
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
i mean so it's
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
it may not be direct
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know managed by the state but there
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
are other entities within the state that
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
use our money to
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
do things so actually um i we were just
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
reminded um that the state did invest i
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
believe the legislature directed us
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
franklin regional hospital
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
funding for their uh designated
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
receiving facility so it actually was in
 
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
the terms of a loan at that point in
 
01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:32.709 align:start position:0%
the terms of a loan at that point in
time

01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
but it was a legislative action that
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
directed the department to do that
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
more questions
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'll give i'll give you three and then
 
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.550 align:start position:0%
i'll give i'll give you three and then
we'll

01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
just this may be my only other one uh
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
but um i i know uh that we've received
 
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
communications uh back channel from dhhs
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
talking about how the state benefits
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
from this and as i as i read the public
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
facing document
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
it shows how hca benefits but it isn't
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
really clear in the write-up how the
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
state benefits and and i know that we do
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
but i i just would like it in the public
 
01:28:14.719 --> 01:28:15.590 align:start position:0%
but i i just would like it in the public
record

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
so uh i i think you know the benefit
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
is is quite obvious we've had an er
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
boarding crisis for 10 years
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
we have invested significantly in the
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
community and in the crisis end of
 
01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.390 align:start position:0%
community and in the crisis end of
things

01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
we have uh you know
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
in addition to investing in the
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
community which we have substantially
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
for the last four years and in the
 
01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
crisis component
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
rapid response mobile crisis teams
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
the third prong to that
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
system is inpatient beds
 
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
our our system have been has been
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
running at 100 capacity 100 of the time
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
for 10 years hospital systems health
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
systems are not meant to do that
 
01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.149 align:start position:0%
systems are not meant to do that
so

01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
this project for a capital with that
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
capital defrayment
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
brings on an additional
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
new beds 38 new beds so the hospital
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
itself that hca is building is a 96 bed
 
01:29:13.199 --> 01:29:14.629 align:start position:0%
itself that hca is building is a 96 bed
hospital

01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
the total
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
they will be closing the their
 
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
behavioral health units in the other
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals that they own in new hampshire
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
and moving those beds into this one
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
facility so the total new beds are 38
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
beds 20 in adult six in geriatric and 12
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
in adolescent
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
so that is expected to have a direct
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
impact on our wait list when you look at
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
our wait list
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
you may see 10 or 20 adults waiting on
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
our wait list on any given day what you
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
is that the actual number of er borders
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
for psychiatric care are is at least two
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
times that the wait list you see is the
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
involuntary wait list you don't see the
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
voluntary wait list where people are
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
voluntary waiting for voluntary bets
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
so the the the great thing about the
 
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
health the health care facility that hca
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
has agreed to build is that they will
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
the bet adult beds will be duly
 
01:30:08.239 --> 01:30:09.430 align:start position:0%
the bet adult beds will be duly
certified

01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
certified
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
they will be both for involuntary and
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
voluntary they are also agreeing to run
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
some subspecialty
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
programs such as eating disorder clinics
 
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
partial hospitalization
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
a 12-bed youth facility for youth age 12
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
to 16. so the health that the state
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
benefits by
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
using arpa money
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
for infrastructure build it's one-time
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
payment for an infrastructure build and
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
investing in the infrastructure of our
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
mental health system which is what you
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
know and i understand that this is
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
coming fast for 10 years we've had an er
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
crisis and we're basically fixing it in
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
two and it it you know the projects are
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
coming very quickly
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
but i think the time time is of the
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
essence and we have the opportunity to
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
use our funds for this type of
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay and so my follow-up i
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
think that was an excellent answer i
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted it on the record so that the
 
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
public knows why we're spending this
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
money uh the the the the other question
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
i think we need to tell the public is
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
why hca why why
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
isn't there another
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
provider out there that we should be
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
putting this 15 million dollars into
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
their infrastructure so at the you know
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
at the same time that we offered the 45
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
000 for nursing home beds we also
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
offered 200 000
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
per bed for a hospital to convert their
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
beds to a drf and although there were
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
interest there was interest no one has
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
been able to execute that uh any beds
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
for for con
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
for increasing drf beds across the state
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
there will be a second
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh request coming forward this is
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
request one to build a 96 bed hospital
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
there will be a second request coming
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
for a 15 million dollar defragment to
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
build a second
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
hospital in new hampshire
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same size by another
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
vendor those two vendors
 
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
one um
 
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.070 align:start position:0%
one um
local

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
non nonprofit in new hampshire and hca
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
who has a very strong who has very
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
strong community ties in the seacoast
 
01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:21.910 align:start position:0%
strong community ties in the seacoast
region

01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
region
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
was the second they are two entities
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
that are ready willing and able to build
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
these we have not had
 
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
any other health system even approach us
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
about converting
 
01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.189 align:start position:0%
about converting
beds

01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
beds
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
to involuntary beds besides the two
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
entities that are offering to build
 
01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:43.189 align:start position:0%
entities that are offering to build
hospitals

01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
representative leishman did you have a
 
01:32:46.719 --> 01:32:47.590 align:start position:0%
representative leishman did you have a
question

01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh thanks madam chair i have a couple
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
but i'll go through the chair of course
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner and uh for coming
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
to see us
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
peter you've got to move
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
mike closer
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
we'll do it that way
 
01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.750 align:start position:0%
we'll do it that way
thanks

01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
so it's certainly there's none of us
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
that would disagree there's a need here
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
i mean we've heard that and we know that
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
by saying this is moving awful fast i
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
guess could be an understatement because
 
01:33:15.199 --> 01:33:16.149 align:start position:0%
guess could be an understatement because
i

01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
recently saw an in-depth uh article that
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
was written just last week
 
01:33:21.679 --> 01:33:22.629 align:start position:0%
was written just last week
and

01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
hca refused to comment to the reporter
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
and what was going on and
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
said that he would not
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
provide any information
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
at this time and decline to say
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
when they would
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
it seems like something like this you'd
 
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
want to get the information out there
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
that this is moving forward the
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
community of epping
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
is in favor of it but i reached out to
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
one of our colleagues from epping who's
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
actually serves on the planning board
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
and nobody has come to epping to discuss
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
this with a planning board and yet
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
it says according to a lot of the
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
documentation that we've received that
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
this facility will be up and running
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
next year so i wonder if you could
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
comment on that
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
why is some of the secret and stuff or
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
why epping is being mentioned is where
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's going and yet apparently the folks
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
in epping haven't heard from hca so i we
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
have the ceo of portsmouth general
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
hospital here if you would like him to
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
come up um and
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
give you information around hca in their
 
01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.510 align:start position:0%
give you information around hca in their
process

01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
would that be appropriate it's up to the
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
chair yeah that would be fine dean
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning uh for the
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
record dean carrucci chief executive
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
officer at portsmouth regional hospital
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the news article we just
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
didn't feel it would be right to comment
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
at this time having not gone through
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
this process
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
and didn't want to get ahead of this
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
committee so that was the only reason
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully within your materials you can
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
see all the details that we've laid out
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of epping it is one location
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
we're considering
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
we have a few that are right along 101
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
that is centrally located between what
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
we view as the population centers
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire meaning
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
manchester i-93 corridor and the 995 for
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
the seacoast region
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
so we have not gone to planning board
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
yet because we did not want to waste
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
folks time until we had locked down
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
which piece made the most sense
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
well just one further question madam
 
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.350 align:start position:0%
well just one further question madam
chair

01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
please go ahead thanks
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
so in some of the information that we
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
just received
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
considerations would have to be given
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
for like property tax breaks so you
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
would be looking for the community that
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
you would be locating in to give like
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
property tax relief is that how i
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
understand your documents
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh those are probably original documents
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
we do not plan to pursue property tax
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh if i could manage you i'm just
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
confused because we just got these
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
documents last week
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
so there's been a change since last week
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions yes
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you madam chair
 
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
i have a few questions if i could
 
01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.390 align:start position:0%
i have a few questions if i could
they're

01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact of this project
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
when we met earlier this morning
 
01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:31.750 align:start position:0%
when we met earlier this morning
commissioner

01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
when you presented to the senate members
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
we were told by the
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid director that when this
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
hospital is fully
 
01:36:42.239 --> 01:36:43.750 align:start position:0%
hospital is fully
operational

01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
operational
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
the non-federal cost
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
increase to medicaid would be about nine
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollars a year so
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
in total about almost 20 million dollars
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
a year
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
how what percentage of the
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
patient bed days
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
are we expecting
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
filled by medicaid enrollees i'm going
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
to have henry come up so he did the
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
calculations thank you
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
the record again henry litman medicaid
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
director thank you for the question
 
01:37:21.679 --> 01:37:22.470 align:start position:0%
director thank you for the question
um

01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
senator um
 
01:37:24.239 --> 01:37:25.669 align:start position:0%
senator um
the

01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the startup year um
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
it was 1195
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
admissions for medicaid which is a
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
little over 40 i believe 40.
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.550 align:start position:0%
and um
the

01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
adult has 236 admissions
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
i think in terms of
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
the percentages in that same
 
01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:49.510 align:start position:0%
the percentages in that same
neighborhood

01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
the startup operations as i understand
 
01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:52.950 align:start position:0%
the startup operations as i understand
the

01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
statistics from um
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
portsmouth's pro forma
 
01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:58.310 align:start position:0%
portsmouth's pro forma
that

01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
you know they're beginning expecting a
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
the first year to be a startup and then
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know they expect an
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
average daily census of somewhat less
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
than the full um
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
that complement of 96 as they're
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
beginning the startup but ultimately
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's a startup is about 73 of full adc
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
and that so there's another
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
20 27 growth i think in the admissions
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
that ultimately might be seen
 
01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:22.870 align:start position:0%
that ultimately might be seen
um

01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
when they're at full um operational
 
01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:26.390 align:start position:0%
when they're at full um operational
status

01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
status
 
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
thank you good follow-up so
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner you also told us that the
 
01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.270 align:start position:0%
commissioner you also told us that the
department

01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
expects there will be savings to the
 
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.030 align:start position:0%
expects there will be savings to the
counties

01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
in corrections and
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
 
01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:43.270 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
corrections

01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
do you know or can you tell us if
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
those entities have
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
been able to calculate
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
savings that they project
 
01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:54.870 align:start position:0%
savings that they project
so

01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
when when i talk about savings in both
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
county jails and the doc and
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
in a variety of other areas that is more
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
of a law the long-term goal as we build
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
out our system what we've talked about
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
is that the acute care side of
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
which is why we filed the imd waiver was
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
to attract
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
private entities to come and provide
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
acute care in new hampshire so this is
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
one example and there will be a second
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
example that will leave new hampshire
 
01:39:24.239 --> 01:39:25.430 align:start position:0%
example that will leave new hampshire
hospital

01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
to provide care to those very
 
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
chronically ill those those people that
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
have a hundred admissions to psychiatric
 
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals um in their lifetime and
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
they're in and out our doors all the
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
time we're expecting to still serve that
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
population at new hampshire hospital the
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
forensic population the justice involved
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
including the dozens and dozens of
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
mentally ill people that we have
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
residing incarcerated in our county
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
jails they many of them belong in a
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
clinical environment not in a clinical
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
environment like portsmouth hospital but
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
in a clinical environment like new
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital so
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
there are several more steps to the
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
build out of the system before we get
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
there senator
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
so i have not been able to quantify what
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
that overall savings would be to
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
the county system or the doc system or
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
any of the other systems including
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
homelessness all of those other systems
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
that it could impact
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you one more yes thank you so if
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
if 40
 
01:40:28.159 --> 01:40:29.590 align:start position:0%
if 40
of

01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:30.470 align:start position:0%
of
the

01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
patients will be
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
projected to be on medicaid
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
then up to
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
60 percent would be either covered by
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
medicare or private insurance
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
if i could senator i just want to
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
clarify what the numbers that i gave was
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
the um as i mentioned to you this
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
morning were the addition the additional
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
beds the 38 additional beds that the
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
dollar figure you quoted and the
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
percentage was based on the additional
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
beds being put into service the 38 beds
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
okay but so that's the incremental cost
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
because

01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about really the most
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
expensive hospital system in the state
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
has anyone in state government looked at
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
the potential impact on health insurance
 
01:41:21.119 --> 01:41:22.790 align:start position:0%
the potential impact on health insurance
premiums

01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
premiums
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
for the voluntary commercially
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
paid beds i know you haven't but do you
 
01:41:31.679 --> 01:41:32.390 align:start position:0%
paid beds i know you haven't but do you
know

01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.149 align:start position:0%
know
if

01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
can we be
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
assured that somewhere within the
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
executive branch
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
somebody is looking at the potential
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
impact on health insurance i can reach
 
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
out to the insurance department and have
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
them do an analysis but what i do want
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
to stress is that
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
although we're adding beds in new
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire many of our citizens that
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
require this inpatient capacity are just
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
leaving the state to get it right now
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
because it's not available in new
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire but i will have our insurance
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
department look and and see if if there
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
will be a significant impact by adding
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
these beds thank you yes
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:42:17.199 --> 01:42:18.870 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
oh

01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
you've had your three days no no
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals took us up on the 200 000
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
incentive payment forget exactly how
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
much that total but is it coming back
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
somehow or is it still it's it's not
 
01:42:32.719 --> 01:42:33.910 align:start position:0%
somehow or is it still it's it's not
spent

01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
the 200 000 incentives payment there are
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
there were several hospitals that were
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
interested for sure there was there was
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
definitely many letters of interest but
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
kovitt hit them so hard in the last year
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
it is really really difficult for them
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
to look beyond
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
operating their hospitals day-to-day
 
01:42:52.239 --> 01:42:53.669 align:start position:0%
operating their hospitals day-to-day
rather

01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
rather
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
than taking another risk so that that
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
money will go back in the pot if it's
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none can i have a motion to
 
01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:09.990 align:start position:0%
seeing none can i have a motion to
accept

01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
accept

into the microphone
 
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
is because this is going out

the only follow-up i have is will the
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
developed quality performance and
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
evaluation metrics be made publicly
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
available and in what time frame
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely we will do that we often and
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um for
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
for raising this because we often get
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
asked at these types of settings how are
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
you going to measure the effectiveness
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
and this was an opportunity through this
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
grant to be able to measure the
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of our programs so yes we
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
can make those publicly available i'll
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
have to check with my team at what point
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
in time that we'll we'll have that
 
01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
information available um i will take
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to say that our new
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire rapid response program just
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
started on january 1st and it's served
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of people already through our
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%

01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
almost every day
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
but for the cost for really looking at
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of it we need a longer
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
period of time for it to be
 
01:46:14.239 --> 01:46:15.270 align:start position:0%
period of time for it to be
um

01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know in implementation and full
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
implementation so it may take close to a
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
year before we're able to really take
 
01:46:22.719 --> 01:46:23.510 align:start position:0%
year before we're able to really take
that

01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
step back and really see how effective
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
it is the other opportunity that we have
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
with this funding is to look at the
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
model we have a model and what we know
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
and our communities and our regions is
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
that not every model
 
01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.709 align:start position:0%
that not every model
fits

01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
fits
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
across the board so that's why we want
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
to look at these and look at the rural
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
areas look at what it means
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
for particular populations
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
are there any further
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me are there any further
 
01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:01.590 align:start position:0%
excuse me are there any further
questions

01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
this is a spirit of brainstorming
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
earlier we saw that 290 000 going to the
 
01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:10.790 align:start position:0%
earlier we saw that 290 000 going to the
military

01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
military
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
daycare for
 
01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:16.719 align:start position:0%
alcohol avoidance i'm just curious if
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
if if you could
 
01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.669 align:start position:0%
if if you could
consider

01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
maybe implementing some training at that
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
child care center so that the kids start
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
to hear it before it becomes a problem
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
for them i mean
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
be nice if we can integrate some of
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
these programs
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's under this effort that
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't contemplated but under
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
the bureau of drug and alcohol services
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
in coordination with the governor's
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
commission and it was referenced earlier
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
by chair
 
01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
tufts that we have prevention efforts
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
and so the governor's commission has
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
really taken a strong look
 
01:47:53.199 --> 01:47:54.149 align:start position:0%
really taken a strong look
and

01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
heavy emphasis and
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
put forth proposals that look at
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
prevention efforts and i can follow up
 
01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
on those efforts and what's happening
 
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
but child care
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
serving agencies are really important
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:13.109 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
questions

01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%

good morning david weeders information
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
services director for dhhs
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards i believe you
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
had uh a question or a comment uh yes
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
ma'am it's kind of a quick one i think
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
we did this offline but i want to get it
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
into the record
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
um on uh mr weeder's good seeing you
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
again good to see you on page two in the
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
first paragraph second sentence
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
it reads the contractor will focus on
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
gathering information on the data being
 
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
collected process stored and used within
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
the solution providing details on the
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
intended use of this data
 
01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
and assessing the privacy controls i
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
think all of that's good i just think
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's missing
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
the plans for data retention and
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
the data destruction plan
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
so you know data has a life cycle and
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
and this sentence overlooked the death
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
of the data
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you for the question um
 
01:50:25.350 --> 01:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
the intent of that was an overview
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
certainly in the contract it's going to
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
have data destruction retention and
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much everything that you would
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
expect in a data governance plan
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
to include how
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
people get access
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
who has access how it would be shared
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
with whom and for why
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for that i think it's
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely brilliant that you guys are
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative edwards are
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
there any further questions
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
does that mean that representative
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
edwards moved the item
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
no because senator daniels has a
 
01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:04.310 align:start position:0%
no because senator daniels has a
question

01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
just one quick question is this going to
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
be a competitive bid a sole source
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question this is going
 
01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
to be a sole source um for
 
01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
the the goal is to try to get this done
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible to address any
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
privacy control issues that may or may
 
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
not be on the system we don't anticipate
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
any privacy control issues in the system
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
but we wanted to
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
have that report to the health and human
 
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
services oversight committee
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible rfp would delay that
 
01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:35.510 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible rfp would delay that
process

01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
representative keith
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
represented earth
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the answers to the
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
questions i posed i just want to confirm
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
that the expectation of privacy
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
assessment will be complete by may of
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
this year and will be made public
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so the goal
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
is to have this if this is approved here
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
at fiscal committee to the next step
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
would be going to
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
governor executive council for approval
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
once that contract is approved it will
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
take six to seven weeks to complete
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then once we have that report we'll
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
put it into a publicly accessible like
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
formatting in case the vendor puts it in
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
their letterhead or whatnot so we're
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
anticipating an extra week for that
 
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
um so the goal would be eight weeks
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
after contract execution
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
currently set for if we get the contract
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
approved in february it would be
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
march april in the in the middle of
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
april beginning of may
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i was actually adding up
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
giving a little bonus time there too i
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move this item
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
senator guida seconds

in august of last year uh for i think
 
01:59:10.709 --> 01:59:10.719 align:start position:0%
approximately 2.7 million dollars for
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
our litigation fund that was
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
the best estimate we had at the time
 
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
as the item explains we've had a number
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
of developments that have
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
significantly increased our estimated
 
01:59:24.550 --> 01:59:24.560 align:start position:0%

01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:25.910 align:start position:0%

year
 
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
one of the primary
 
01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
matters that accounts for this is the
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
ydc criminal investigation
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
and also the civil side of that matter
 
01:59:37.589 --> 01:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
one thing that i think has
 
01:59:37.599 --> 01:59:38.550 align:start position:0%
one thing that i think has
that

01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
hasn't been completely understood by the
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
public is that as part of the criminal
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
investigation of the youth development
 
01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:45.270 align:start position:0%
investigation of the youth development
center

01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
center
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
we also have to assist the department of
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
health and human services with
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
responding to requests related to that
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation and that happens
 
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
on our on the civil side of our office
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
so that that has just resulted in a very
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
large volume of records and documents
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
that need to be produced and reviewed
 
02:00:05.119 --> 02:00:06.149 align:start position:0%
that need to be produced and reviewed
we

02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%

02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
we came before you and got approval for
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%

02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
for the criminal investigation and also
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
reducing the need for outside help
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
for the for the criminal lawyers who who
 
02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
have to ultimately produce these
 
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
documents to the defense
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
so that that
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
sheer volume of the documents involved
 
02:00:50.229 --> 02:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
is is much greater than i think we
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
anticipated back over the summer
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
so much of this investigation has really
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
heated up or i should say much of the
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
prosecution part of this matter is
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
really heated up since we charged 11
 
02:01:04.629 --> 02:01:04.639 align:start position:0%
individuals back in april
 
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
as we've moved
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
i think we have a better handle now on
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
on what we're looking at over the next
 
02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:11.679 align:start position:0%
couple years and we'll be able to
 
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
estimate this more accurately going
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
forward you know now that we've got
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
charged cases and now that those cases
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
are moving forward but anyway the ydc
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
matter is a big component of this
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
a major transaction i think you're all
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
probably aware of what it is but but a
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
major transaction within our antitrust
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
bureau and it's an investigation we're
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
doing of the proposed combination
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
between dartmouth-hitchcock health and
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
granite one so i don't want to go i
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
can't go into the details of of that but
 
02:01:43.599 --> 02:01:44.790 align:start position:0%
can't go into the details of of that but
that

02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
that is a review and investigation that
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
is taking
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
longer than we anticipated it may take
 
02:01:53.350 --> 02:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
back in august i was hoping that we
 
02:01:55.510 --> 02:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
would we would have it completed by the
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
end of the year when we came before you
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
in august at this point we're looking
 
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
more towards march or april and that
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
that will result in additional costs and
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
then the third major component of this
 
02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
request is
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
a couple of federal court cases that we
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
provided you some detail on
 
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
that that got past the motion to dismiss
 
02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
stage so in august we were still hopeful
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
that we would we would not have to go
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
past the motion to dismiss stage in
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
these cases
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
motions to dismiss in both of those
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
cases were denied and what that means is
 
02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
we're now moving into discovery which
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
will require a large amount of document
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
review a um
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
some assistance from outside counsel and
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
how we manage that it'll require
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
many depositions so it's just an
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
additional burden on our civil
 
02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
litigation unit
 
02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
in addition to those three major
 
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
components what we're seeing right now
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
from my perspective and i've also
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
confirmed this with folks who have been
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
in the office longer we we are dealing
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
with a higher volume of of civil
 
02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:02.709 align:start position:0%
with a higher volume of of civil
litigation

02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
than we have in a long time and perhaps
 
02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
ever we're just in an era where states
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
and governments are being sued more and
 
02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
more often and so
 
02:03:11.199 --> 02:03:12.310 align:start position:0%
more often and so
we

02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
that that's placing a large burden on on
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
our civil litigation unit
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
i'm actively
 
02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
working on and i've tasked the team with
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
working on strategies for how to address
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
this in the next budget
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things we've already started
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
to do is is obtain
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
things like more up-to-date e-discovery
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
tools to
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
to make our processes as efficient as
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
possible so that we do not need to
 
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
utilize outside counsel for help
 
02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
but the reality is is that if our
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
lawyers are busy with a very high volume
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
of cases when we get these major matters
 
02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:47.189 align:start position:0%
of cases when we get these major matters
in

02:03:47.189 --> 02:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to manage discovery
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
and keep these cases moving along and
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
not get ourselves into a place where we
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
settle the cases on poor terms for the
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
state we need to utilize outside counsel
 
02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
and that's a significant expense so
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
again we'll be
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
we'll be putting a lot of effort into
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
how we address that and looking for
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
strategies to address that in the next
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
budget but for purposes of sitting here
 
02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:13.990 align:start position:0%
budget but for purposes of sitting here
now

02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
that that really is the major driving
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
force behind behind these
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
increased estimated costs for the rest
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year to both prosecute
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
criminal matters and defend the state in
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
civil litigation so that that's an
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
overview of the request i'm happy to
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
answer any any specific questions you
 
02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.669 align:start position:0%
answer any any specific questions you
have

02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
senator guido thank you madam chair
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh general as you know this committee
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
has been served
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
and would it be safe to say that
 
02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
incorporated in the cost you're asking
 
02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
us to fund is potentially your reaction
 
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
to that action yes that is one of the
 
02:04:57.510 --> 02:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
many cases we're working on but yes we
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
represent all of you and everyone else
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
who's been served in that case so yes
 
02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
that would be accurate
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
the only one here is senator birdsall
 
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have fun uh
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
senator roosevelt thank you madam chair
 
02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
i know this state is prepared to go to
 
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
trial against um johnson and johnson in
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
a week or two
 
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
is that factored in here or is that a
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
separate contingency-based
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
piece yeah that is not factored in here
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
because we we signed a contingency uh
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
fee agreement with outside counsel long
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
ago and so they
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
they're handling all those costs and
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
whatever we recover in an eventual
 
02:05:50.310 --> 02:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
settlement or a verdict
 
02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
they will be paid with a percentage of
 
02:05:52.079 --> 02:05:54.229 align:start position:0%
they will be paid with a percentage of
that

02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:06:00.310 --> 02:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay let's divide two million dollars by
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.199 --> 02:06:06.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:08.229 --> 02:06:08.239 align:start position:0%

02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
19 million

of 83

and decrease other revenues by

and decrease other revenues by

02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%

02:07:36.629 --> 02:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
and create a new expenditure class code
 
02:07:36.639 --> 02:07:48.149 align:start position:0%
and create a new expenditure class code
so

02:07:48.149 --> 02:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh dhhs you just give us a
 
02:07:59.350 --> 02:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
quick overview of
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
why we need to do this
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
so periodically approximately three
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
times a year the department does come in
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
and reallocate funding
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
that was originally budgeted
 
02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:13.669 align:start position:0%
that was originally budgeted
to

02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:16.709 --> 02:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
address needs as they have arisen since
 
02:08:20.830 --> 02:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:25.350 --> 02:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:28.069 --> 02:08:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh representative erf
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman uh thank you
 
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:32.079 align:start position:0%
for answering questions i had previously
 
02:08:32.079 --> 02:08:32.870 align:start position:0%
for answering questions i had previously
asked

02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
asked
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
i received a spreadsheet in the last day
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
or so which i'm guessing is from you
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
which was really helpful in
 
02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
understanding the underlying
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and i know i'm unusual in
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
this regard but i would ask would you
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
might be able to provide that in the
 
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
future with the fiscal note when it
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
comes outside a little more time to
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
understand it certainly we've used the
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
same format for well over 10 years and
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
have not been asked to change it until
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
recently and certainly we can
 
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
make adjustments to that if it better
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
suits what you're looking for well thank
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
you for the changes those are great too
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
but even just having even the change
 
02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
without the spreadsheet i couldn't
 
02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:10.870 align:start position:0%
without the spreadsheet i couldn't
understand

02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay but once you gave me the
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet it was made a lot more sense
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for all the help
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that the committee
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
has asked and we'll ask
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
not only health and human services but
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
all of the departments when it's time to
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
do transfers
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
that we would like to see what we call a
 
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
to and from
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's going here and it came from here
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the information is all there
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
but it's difficult
 
02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
because not all of us are
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
well aware of what's in your in your
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
budget although overall we know so
 
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
if uh if we could do that and i know
 
02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:01.669 align:start position:0%
if uh if we could do that and i know
that

02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
mr kane has
 
02:10:05.589 --> 02:10:05.599 align:start position:0%
indicated that
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
he will
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
pass that on to das
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
so are there any question any further
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
questions yes senator edwards uh
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know one of the reasons i've really
 
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
enjoyed working with ms rounds this past
 
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
year is that she's just a straight
 
02:10:26.069 --> 02:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
shooter and so
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
um the question i have here
 
02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:29.350 align:start position:0%
um the question i have here
is

02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:30.709 align:start position:0%
is
um

02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:30.719 --> 02:10:31.510 align:start position:0%
um
i

02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
while i understand that there's normal
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
budget variances that
 
02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
our budgeting knowledge isn't perfect in
 
02:10:39.199 --> 02:10:40.550 align:start position:0%
our budgeting knowledge isn't perfect in
reality

02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
reality
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's just going to happen you know um
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
but what i'm curious about that i
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
is did did we did we
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
learn anything in this particular round
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
of budget variances did we
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
did we miss something did we make a you
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
know a a significant communication error
 
02:11:03.750 --> 02:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
that we're fixing i i'm just i'm i'm
 
02:11:06.149 --> 02:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
looking for you know lessons learned
 
02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
i would want to do a deeper analysis
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to respond to specifics of
 
02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
that one thing that comes to mind
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
when we budget vacant positions they're
 
02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
all budgeted at step one
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
one thing we found is often vacant
 
02:11:23.830 --> 02:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
positions get filled at a much higher
 
02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:24.870 align:start position:0%
positions get filled at a much higher
step

02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
step
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
which means the dollars to pay for those
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
positions weren't budgeted at the
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate level
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
so that's something that we could
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
provide data on
 
02:11:37.830 --> 02:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
that might assist in terms of how we
 
02:11:42.069 --> 02:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
all right i'm i'm not looking for any
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
more data
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
but if ms rounds wanted to uh you know
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
inform me
 
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
if we've if she's learned anything in
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
this uh variance adjustment process
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's significant or material i'd i'd
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate just hearing that i'll speak
 
02:12:00.149 --> 02:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
with you
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%

02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh are there any further questions
 
02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:08.870 align:start position:0%
uh are there any further questions
uh

02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%

02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you uh could you just give us a
 
02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
short overview of i don't think we have
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
any problem with uh
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
what's occurring but it would just be
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
nice for a short
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you thank you for the
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity you know chair
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh the circuit court was created in 2011
 
02:13:58.709 --> 02:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
when it was created there were
 
02:13:58.719 --> 02:14:00.310 align:start position:0%
when it was created there were
30

02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
30
 
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:07.109 align:start position:0%
 
32

02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
32
 
02:14:07.119 --> 02:14:08.470 align:start position:0%
32
judges

02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
judges
 
02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
and 13 marital masters
 
02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
when the court was created the
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
legislature provided
 
02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
that when a marital master left that
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
position could be converted
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
to a judicial officer
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
and as
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
the materials i submitted with our
 
02:14:26.159 --> 02:14:28.069 align:start position:0%
the materials i submitted with our
letter

02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
letter
 
02:14:28.079 --> 02:14:30.069 align:start position:0%
letter
indicate

02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
indicate
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
that has happened
 
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
eight times over the intervening period
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
to have that happen requires two things
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
one approval of the fiscal committee and
 
02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:41.189 align:start position:0%
one approval of the fiscal committee and
two

02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that sufficient funds have been
 
02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:44.550 align:start position:0%
the fact that sufficient funds have been
appropriated

02:14:44.550 --> 02:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
to cover the judicial officer
 
02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
and in my letter i have
 
02:14:52.390 --> 02:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
indicated that we have appropriated
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient funds for this biennium to
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
cover the judicial officer
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
we have at present
 
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
two mayoral masters
 
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
and 39 circuit judges
 
02:15:08.470 --> 02:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
total of 41 judicial officers a marital
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
master has indicated that he is retiring
 
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
as of february 1st so that would convert
 
02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
that position
 
02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
to a full-time circuit judge
 
02:15:22.229 --> 02:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
and how long do we anticipate until
 
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's a great question i defer to the
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
it's uh from my perspective madam chair
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible but i leave that
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
to the governor oh okay
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:15:45.750 --> 02:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
well you know um
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
when we when you lose a person
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
on the circuit court it really
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh creates a lot of problems and that's
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons i was asking
 
02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
i agree with the chair and um it's one
 
02:16:02.470 --> 02:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
of the reasons we are coming forward as
 
02:16:04.229 --> 02:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
quickly as we are to get the position
 
02:16:06.550 --> 02:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
converted so there's no
 
02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:09.109 align:start position:0%
converted so there's no
undue

02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
diminishment in productivity
 
02:16:13.589 --> 02:16:13.599 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
02:16:13.599 --> 02:16:16.390 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
questions

02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh senator
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
oh you had a question yes oh go ahead
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
um i've been around long enough where i
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
remember the times when
 
02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:27.669 align:start position:0%
remember the times when
uh

02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
judiciary came to the legislature and
 
02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
talked about how they needed all these
 
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
marital masters now we seem to be going
 
02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
the other way
 
02:16:39.750 --> 02:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
is the intent to phase out
 
02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
the marital master and convert them all
 
02:16:45.429 --> 02:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
back and if that is the case
 
02:16:47.669 --> 02:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
then what went wrong with the previous
 
02:16:47.679 --> 02:16:48.870 align:start position:0%
then what went wrong with the previous
experiment

02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
experiment
 
02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
the this is
 
02:16:53.429 --> 02:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
an entirely uh this is a policy decision
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
that was made by the legislature in 2011
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
when a marital master
 
02:16:59.599 --> 02:17:00.469 align:start position:0%
when a marital master
left

02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
left
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
that position
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
pursuant to legislation could be
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
converted to judicial officers so that
 
02:17:09.669 --> 02:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
was the decision senator that this body
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
made back in 2011.
 
02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
as you just stated it could be
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
converted but
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
it appears that
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
you choose not to
 
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
convert it
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
i am here asking for the current
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
anticipated vacancy to be converted
 
02:17:31.519 --> 02:17:32.230 align:start position:0%
anticipated vacancy to be converted
okay

02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:17:34.950 --> 02:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
let me see if i can rephrase my question
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's not a requirement
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
that you if that you change
 
02:17:42.870 --> 02:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
a marital master position to a
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
justice position no it does not it if
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
i'm understanding senator your question
 
02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:49.519 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen automatically and it's
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
not required it is within
 
02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know our discretion to come forward
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
to this committee and ask for approval
 
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
and ultimately it's a decision for the
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
02:17:59.280 --> 02:17:59.990 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
so

02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
so why are we
 
02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:05.599 align:start position:0%
asking for this conversion as opposed to
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
filling it some other way
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
there is no other way to con to fill it
 
02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:18.309 align:start position:0%
there is no other way to con to fill it
okay

02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative lynn you had a question
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah if i might just add a little bit of
 
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
context to this i think i think senator
 
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's not because i do have some some
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
background in this i think
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
that this is really sort of a long and
 
02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:34.070 align:start position:0%
that this is really sort of a long and
uh

02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:35.830 --> 02:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
candidly as i think it's a story in
 
02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
large part of the legislature changing
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
its mind
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
in 2011
 
02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
the the idea the the statute was enacted
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
that permitted the change uh the
 
02:18:50.070 --> 02:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
conversion to uh
 
02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
from marital masters to circuit court
 
02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:53.110 align:start position:0%
from marital masters to circuit court
judges

02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
judges
 
02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
and initially the the
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
and i think for that
 
02:18:56.800 --> 02:18:58.230 align:start position:0%
and i think for that
biennium

02:18:58.230 --> 02:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
the idea was that the that this change
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
would occur by attrition that when as
 
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
marital masters retired they would be
 
02:19:09.910 --> 02:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
replaced by circuit court judges
 
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
and and candidly in my view very
 
02:19:16.230 --> 02:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
unfairly the legislature changed its
 
02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
mind and decided that some marital
 
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
masters should be terminated and in fact
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
some were
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
quite unfairly in my mind
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
after that
 
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
at some point and i can't give you an
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
exam example when but certainly while i
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
was still still working in the judicial
 
02:19:34.559 --> 02:19:35.429 align:start position:0%
was still still working in the judicial
branch

02:19:35.429 --> 02:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
branch
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature decided i think for
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
monetary reasons and i'm not i please
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
understand i'm not criticizing that may
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
have been entirely appropriate the
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
legislature decided well
 
02:19:49.349 --> 02:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
because marital masters are paid less
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
maybe it does make some sense to kind of
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
continue with marital masters
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
and so for a certain period of time then
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
there were no changes
 
02:19:57.359 --> 02:19:58.790 align:start position:0%
there were no changes
and

02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:00.070 align:start position:0%
and
now

02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know it seems that that has changed
 
02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.190 align:start position:0%
you know it seems that that has changed
again

02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding and i and i asked
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
particularly judge ashley who's been
 
02:20:09.910 --> 02:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
here for a long time my understanding is
 
02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:10.950 align:start position:0%
here for a long time my understanding is
that

02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of the judicial
 
02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:14.790 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of the judicial
branch

02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
branch
 
02:20:17.670 --> 02:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
we believed all along from the beginning
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
when this statute was first enacted that
 
02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
it was although we certainly didn't
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
think anybody should be fired we thought
 
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
we agreed with the idea initially that
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
all this change should be by attrition
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
but we agreed with the idea that it was
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
better to have circuit court judges
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
rather than marital masters so it was
 
02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:37.670 align:start position:0%
rather than marital masters so it was
not

02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh as far as i know it was never the
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
circuit court that thought
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
we should
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
kind of you know not make the
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
conversions but
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
for a period of time we didn't do it
 
02:20:49.990 --> 02:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
because we understood that that's what
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature desired
 
02:20:54.389 --> 02:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
that's if if my understanding miss
 
02:20:56.309 --> 02:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
ashley uh judge ashley is anything is
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
wrong please correct me that is an
 
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
accurate assessment please please turn
 
02:21:03.429 --> 02:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
your mic on i'm sorry
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
my apologies can you hear me better now
 
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:08.950 --> 02:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
so what the legislation actually
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
requires is that that marital master
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
position shall convert to a judicial
 
02:21:15.670 --> 02:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
position upon its
 
02:21:18.389 --> 02:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
being vacant provided just as the chief
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
indicated earlier that there is
 
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
the request of the fiscal committee to
 
02:21:25.590 --> 02:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
allow that conversion and then the
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
funding being available it doesn't
 
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
really give us the option to continue or
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
appoint another marital master in place
 
02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
of the one who's retiring
 
02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
so that's what we have to do we have to
 
02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:36.550 align:start position:0%
so that's what we have to do we have to
come

02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
come
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
and ask all of you folks for assistance
 
02:21:40.870 --> 02:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
with this process in order to fill the
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
vacancy that we have now for the one of
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%

of a strategic question to get your
 
02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
thoughts um the technical question is as
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
i understand it
 
02:26:06.070 --> 02:26:06.080 align:start position:0%

02:26:16.630 --> 02:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
selling them um that we will have
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
revenue returned and it will be somehow
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
credited back and so
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%

the technical question is an accounting
one

02:26:23.910 --> 02:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't there
 
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
as we're seeing 12 million
 
02:26:29.270 --> 02:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
going out shouldn't we see the 12
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
mary police deputy cfo
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
the it will come back in we are still
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
working out the logistics with um bureau
 
02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
of accounting on how we will reflect
 
02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:48.950 align:start position:0%
of accounting on how we will reflect
that

02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
so will that require another fiscal
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee vote that remains to be seen
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
at this time unlikely
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
but that remains to be seen we have not
 
02:26:59.429 --> 02:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
worked out all the specifics thank you
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
and then the follow-up on this it's kind
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
of the strategic question i
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
i you know i i don't i don't know the
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
really have the feel
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
that you both have for
 
02:27:10.319 --> 02:27:11.349 align:start position:0%
that you both have for
um

02:27:11.349 --> 02:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
the sort of the rhythm of where we are
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
in the covit process we've had delta
 
02:27:20.070 --> 02:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
which is a big one we've had omicron
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
which was contagious but
 
02:27:22.399 --> 02:27:23.510 align:start position:0%
which was contagious but
it

02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
are we buying
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
these kits
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
right as the demand for the kits are
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
about to drop
 
02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
substantially i mean the the the initial
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
estimate of the need was probably done a
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago when it was oh my god the
 
02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
world is caving in but now that we're a
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
little further in the process
 
02:27:46.469 --> 02:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if if
 
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
if this is
 
02:27:50.469 --> 02:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
too much too late
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
if i may representative
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
again my name is jonathan ballard
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
as you're aware
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
nationally there's a demand for rapid
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
test kits it's essential to keep
 
02:28:06.389 --> 02:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
businesses open children in school child
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
care open
 
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
the economy continuing to function in
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
the midst of continuous surge in the
 
02:28:14.230 --> 02:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
covet 19 pandemic
 
02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:15.030 align:start position:0%
covet 19 pandemic
the

02:28:15.030 --> 02:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
current situation is the federal
 
02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
government is buying up
 
02:28:21.670 --> 02:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
large swaths of the rapid antigen test
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's been announced that they may need
 
02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
500 million now additional 500 million
 
02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:27.429 align:start position:0%
500 million now additional 500 million
soon

02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
soon
 
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
and there's a website that's been
 
02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
released where individuals can request
 
02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
at this time four tests to be mailed to
 
02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
their individuals
 
02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:36.469 align:start position:0%
their individuals
homes

02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
homes
 
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
much like new hampshire has already done
 
02:28:39.990 --> 02:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of rounds
 
02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.590 align:start position:0%
a couple of rounds
recently

02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
recently
 
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
but what has part of that national
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
purchase is that they are not purchasing
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
stock that is already
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
out in the market produced
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
they've entered into contracts with
 
02:28:54.309 --> 02:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of rapid antigen tests for
 
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
those that have
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
not been promised already
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with today is this is
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
really a short-term issue in that we
 
02:29:04.389 --> 02:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
have large numbers of people who need
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
access to those tests now
 
02:29:08.469 --> 02:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
and we have vendors who do have these
 
02:29:10.469 --> 02:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
tests available now
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
but they're not into the system where
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
individuals can purchase them
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
there's limited stock in the pharmacies
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
and other locations and they're as
 
02:29:21.670 --> 02:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
you're been aware there's
 
02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
shortages where people are not able to
 
02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
get them they're there on some days of
 
02:29:26.950 --> 02:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
the week but not every day essentially
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
and so it can create a barrier for
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
schools to be open
 
02:29:33.510 --> 02:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
barriers for children to have
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
access to those tests and employers so
 
02:29:39.750 --> 02:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
what we intend to do with this purchase
 
02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
is to go through a competitive bid
 
02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:42.790 align:start position:0%
is to go through a competitive bid
process

02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
all those different vendors that are
 
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
approaching us and saying that they have
 
02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
tests available now but they can't get
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
them out to the public we just want to
 
02:29:51.429 --> 02:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
make sure that that access happens
 
02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
and so through a competitive competitive
 
02:29:55.510 --> 02:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
bid process working with department
 
02:29:57.670 --> 02:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
administrative services who the team
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
that procures medical equipment to offer
 
02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:01.110 align:start position:0%
that procures medical equipment to offer
that

02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
procurement immediately get these into
 
02:30:05.359 --> 02:30:06.230 align:start position:0%
procurement immediately get these into
sell

02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
sell
 
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:30:10.309 --> 02:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
recover our cost essentially not making
 
02:30:12.790 --> 02:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
looking to make any profit off of this
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
but ensuring access to all individuals
 
02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's all what it is it's just ensuring
 
02:30:19.349 --> 02:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
access and meeting the
 
02:30:21.910 --> 02:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
an observation that we can meet the
 
02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:29.110 align:start position:0%
an observation that we can meet the
need

02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay so to follow that up uh what what i
 
02:30:34.389 --> 02:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
what i think i heard you say to my
 
02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
question is that this is the right
 
02:30:37.359 --> 02:30:38.870 align:start position:0%
question is that this is the right
quantity

02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
quantity
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
at the right time that that we
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
knowing what we know today
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
we are validating the decision that was
 
02:30:49.830 --> 02:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
probably made a month or so ago
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's accurate representative
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
aware the department worked with our
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
partners at the cdc and the nih to be
 
02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
the only state that dispersed an initial
 
02:31:02.469 --> 02:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
round of nearly a million tests and then
 
02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
we were able to do it again with another
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
round of of 750 000 tests that got us
 
02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
through about two weeks in early
 
02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
december another two weeks there in late
 
02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:12.550 align:start position:0%
december another two weeks there in late
december

02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
december
 
02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
and then that this would be another
 
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
essential round of a similar size
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
quantity that could get us through you
 
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
know the next you know
 
02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:23.030 align:start position:0%
know the next you know
period

02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh what is the
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
projected date for having these kits in
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:31:34.910 --> 02:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
simultaneously we did not want to slow
 
02:31:39.670 --> 02:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
down and we also wanted to
 
02:31:41.270 --> 02:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
to have
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire have the advantage of
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
obtaining the tests that are out there
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
and the limited number that are already
 
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
produced and ready so we've been working
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
with department administrative services
 
02:31:50.479 --> 02:31:51.590 align:start position:0%
with department administrative services
to

02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:31:53.349 --> 02:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
open the competitive bid process it
 
02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
actually closed today we're actually
 
02:31:57.910 --> 02:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
able to open all the bids and find out
 
02:31:57.920 --> 02:31:59.270 align:start position:0%
able to open all the bids and find out
what

02:31:59.270 --> 02:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:04.150 --> 02:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
we had a number i don't know which one
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
will be chosen it'll be competitive and
 
02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
go through proper procedures but a
 
02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
number of these different manufacturers
 
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
and distributors have the test in hand
 
02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:13.750 align:start position:0%
and distributors have the test in hand
and

02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
have indicated that they would like to
 
02:32:18.469 --> 02:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
ship them directly to the warehouses
 
02:32:19.750 --> 02:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
and get them out into the stores as
 
02:32:23.429 --> 02:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:26.309 --> 02:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you does this then have
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
to go to the executive council
 
02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
also so i'm really looking for
 
02:32:34.710 --> 02:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
a date when these tests will be in the
 
02:32:36.870 --> 02:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
stores so the next executive council
 
02:32:39.270 --> 02:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
meeting on the 27th i believe will have
 
02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
an accept and expend of these funds but
 
02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
because it's going through the
 
02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
competitive bid process it's not a
 
02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
contract it's through actual procurement
 
02:32:48.790 --> 02:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
through existing vendors
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
but it's the 27th it does have to go
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
through executive council in a different
 
02:32:58.389 --> 02:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:00.469 --> 02:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
then at that point in time the vendors
 
02:33:00.479 --> 02:33:02.389 align:start position:0%
then at that point in time the vendors
would

02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
have the go-ahead that they would be
 
02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
paid and would be able to start shipping
 
02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
so seven to ten days after the executive
 
02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:16.150 align:start position:0%
so seven to ten days after the executive
council

02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:18.180 --> 02:33:18.190 align:start position:0%
he's a doctor i'm a nurse
 
02:33:18.190 --> 02:33:21.590 align:start position:0%
he's a doctor i'm a nurse
[Laughter]

02:33:21.590 --> 02:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:29.349 --> 02:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh senator daniels you have a question
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh the the explanation states that the
 
02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:34.710 align:start position:0%
uh the the explanation states that the
funds

02:33:34.710 --> 02:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:33:36.469 --> 02:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
from the sales of these will then be
 
02:33:36.479 --> 02:33:37.910 align:start position:0%
from the sales of these will then be
reallocated

02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
reallocated
 
02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
to another eligible expense under the
 
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
normal process
 
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
does that normal process include coming
 
02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:46.230 align:start position:0%
does that normal process include coming
back

02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
to fiscal to determine
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
where the 12 million will be reallocated
 
02:33:52.710 --> 02:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
or are they going to be able to just
 
02:33:54.790 --> 02:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
take that 12 million and put it wherever
 
02:33:57.830 --> 02:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
they want without coming that speaks to
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
um when we get this money from the sales
 
02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
it will free up the arpa dollars that
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
are being used to make this purchase and
 
02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
that those dollars would then be
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
reallocated through the normal process i
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
understand what i'm saying i'm asking
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
what the normal process is i'm asking if
 
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
if then somebody can take that 12
 
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars and go and spend it
 
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
without coming back to fiscal or whether
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to need to come back to
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal and say
 
02:34:25.830 --> 02:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
i believe they would need to come back
 
02:34:28.830 --> 02:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
to fiscal yes okay thank
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%

02:34:45.830 --> 02:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
experience that is to have someone
 
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:48.080 align:start position:0%

responsible public servants there when
 
02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
we need them
 
02:34:58.469 --> 02:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
and that is essential that's what makes
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
government work you're helping to make
 
02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%

thanks so thanks
 
02:35:10.469 --> 02:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
i didn't get any comments with regard to
 
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
my health or anything of that nature it
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
was just a professional
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
question so thank you so much he's not
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
he's not acting as my doctor but he's
 
02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
actually okay a state employee
 
02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam you're quite welcome
 
02:35:25.590 --> 02:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh and representative leachman uh thank
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
you madam chair but when i see
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
alessandra's numbers show up on my phone
 
02:35:33.510 --> 02:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
but i do have a real question
 
02:35:38.309 --> 02:35:38.319 align:start position:0%
so you don't have an idea right now of
 
02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
the cost associated with these kits and
 
02:35:44.469 --> 02:35:44.479 align:start position:0%
what the administrative costs might be
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
that someone would bear if they
 
02:35:48.309 --> 02:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
purchased one
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question uh
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
so the open market i think they're
 
02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:53.429 align:start position:0%
so the open market i think they're
around

02:35:53.429 --> 02:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
10 to 12 per test
 
02:35:58.469 --> 02:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
so that's actually the fee that
 
02:35:59.830 --> 02:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government has said that
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
insurance should be reimbursing persons
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
for would be 12 per test
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
and so that's sort of the cost you know
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
if you have a box that has two tests in
 
02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:09.110 align:start position:0%
if you have a box that has two tests in
it

02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:36:11.349 --> 02:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
twenty to twenty four dollars but i
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
guess i can say that now that the
 
02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
competitive bid process is closed
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to say that in advance
 
02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:18.469 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to say that in advance
obviously

02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
and then there would be i don't know
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
about the actual fee for the
 
02:36:26.070 --> 02:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
liquor commission to be able to to sell
 
02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:27.349 align:start position:0%
liquor commission to be able to to sell
the

02:36:27.349 --> 02:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
product but somewhere on the range of
 
02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
one to two dollars is what we understand
 
02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you madam chair
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions senator
 
02:36:39.030 --> 02:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
guidance tongue-in-cheek madam chair i
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
would inquire if the liquor commission
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
is expecting to see an increase in
 
02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
revenues because they are the point of
 
02:36:47.429 --> 02:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
dispensation of these tests
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you senator we have heard that you
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.270 --> 02:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:59.270 --> 02:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
02:37:01.110 --> 02:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:37:02.469 --> 02:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%

this was a
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
standard procedure just appears to be a
 
02:38:33.270 --> 02:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%

information
 
02:38:52.080 --> 02:38:53.990 align:start position:0%
information
and

02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:56.870 --> 02:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
i just felt that this was an excellent
 
02:38:56.880 --> 02:38:58.389 align:start position:0%
i just felt that this was an excellent
report

02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
and that uh your your folks that are
 
02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:03.510 align:start position:0%
and that uh your your folks that are
managing

02:39:03.510 --> 02:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
managing
 
02:39:05.910 --> 02:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
the health benefits are obviously doing
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
a good job
 
02:39:09.510 --> 02:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
and because
 
02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
some of us remember
 
02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:12.550 align:start position:0%
some of us remember
when

02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:39:13.830 --> 02:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
you were here
 
02:39:15.670 --> 02:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
pleading for money
 
02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
because the health insurance
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
and dental insurance were in such
 
02:39:22.319 --> 02:39:23.429 align:start position:0%
and dental insurance were in such
terrible

02:39:23.429 --> 02:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
terrible
 
02:39:23.439 --> 02:39:24.389 align:start position:0%
terrible

state
 
02:39:24.399 --> 02:39:25.429 align:start position:0%
state
so

02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:27.990 --> 02:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for getting us to the point
 
02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:28.950 align:start position:0%
thank you for getting us to the point
where

02:39:28.950 --> 02:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
we can uh
 
02:39:33.910 --> 02:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
be very pleased with what's going on
 
02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
in the health insurance arena so thank
 
02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:39.200 align:start position:0%

02:39:43.270 --> 02:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
we also got a report on uh
 
02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:44.550 align:start position:0%
we also got a report on uh
pfas

02:39:44.550 --> 02:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%

02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
peace stuff that goes on with that
 
02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
and um i want to thank
 
02:39:54.150 --> 02:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
environmental services for that
 
02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:55.510 align:start position:0%
environmental services for that
information

02:39:55.510 --> 02:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:39:58.230 --> 02:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
and it may be that i just had not been
 
02:40:01.030 --> 02:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
keeping up with all the reporting but it
 
02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:02.070 align:start position:0%
keeping up with all the reporting but it
certainly

02:40:02.070 --> 02:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:40:05.590 --> 02:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
helped me in understanding what was
 
02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
going on with the
 
02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:14.800 align:start position:0%

which is the operating statistics

which is the operating statistics

02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:28.080 align:start position:0%

02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
did anyone have any questions on this
 
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:42.150 --> 02:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
this is just a very
 
02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
simple question
 
02:40:44.399 --> 02:40:45.830 align:start position:0%
simple question
um

02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:47.429 --> 02:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
we all
 
02:40:50.230 --> 02:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
obtain eye strain
 
02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:51.830 align:start position:0%
obtain eye strain
from

02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:54.150 align:start position:0%
from
reading

02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
reading
 
02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
your dashboard
 
02:40:59.269 --> 02:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
and it
 
02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
it makes it
 
02:41:04.309 --> 02:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
difficult to um
 
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
try to come to grips with
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
all of the hard work that you're putting
 
02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:10.790 align:start position:0%
all of the hard work that you're putting
into

02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
providing us the dashboard
 
02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and we we really appreciate it
 
02:41:20.950 --> 02:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:23.110 --> 02:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's just i don't know
 
02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
i don't have any answer to it
 
02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
but i just know that um
 
02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
you heard
 
02:41:30.469 --> 02:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative leitchman say that
 
02:41:33.590 --> 02:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
earlier today and
 
02:41:35.190 --> 02:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't know how to solve
 
02:41:37.910 --> 02:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
the problem well two years ago i wanted
 
02:41:40.150 --> 02:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
to change the dashboard because i felt
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
like there was more relevant information
 
02:41:43.830 --> 02:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
that i could provide the committee
 
02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
rather than going back to 18 and 19
 
02:41:51.110 --> 02:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
and i was asked not to change it
 
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
who asked you that fiscal
 
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:02.469 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:42:02.469 --> 02:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:42:04.950 --> 02:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
yeah to making changes i'll i'll
 
02:42:07.190 --> 02:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
continue to provide what i have and then
 
02:42:08.950 --> 02:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
when we come up with a new dashboard
 
02:42:11.349 --> 02:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
i'll provide it in addition to so that
 
02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
02:42:15.110 --> 02:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
whether the new format and the new
 
02:42:17.830 --> 02:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
information better suits
 
02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
or is more relevant to your decision
 
02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
making when i look at this dashboard and
 
02:42:23.110 --> 02:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
i see
 
02:42:25.830 --> 02:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
years past i just i don't know how it's
 
02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:26.950 align:start position:0%
years past i just i don't know how it's
relevant

02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
02:42:28.710 --> 02:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
to some of the decisions you're making
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
and that's what makes the
 
02:42:33.269 --> 02:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
the the print so small is that we go
 
02:42:36.070 --> 02:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
back so far so is there a better way
 
02:42:37.990 --> 02:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
to provide you this information that
 
02:42:40.230 --> 02:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
makes it more relevant and useful to the
 
02:42:43.030 --> 02:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
discussion and to the decisions
 
02:42:43.910 --> 02:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:46.399 align:start position:0%
okay i'll work on it okay it probably
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
won't be ready for next month but in the
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
coming months
 
02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
i will come with something okay thank
 
02:42:56.469 --> 02:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:58.230 --> 02:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned that you would like to
 
02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
provide us information to help us make
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
our decisions the information i also get
 
02:43:07.269 --> 02:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
extremely interested in is the critical
 
02:43:07.279 --> 02:43:08.389 align:start position:0%
extremely interested in is the critical
information

02:43:08.389 --> 02:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:43:10.870 --> 02:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's driving your decisions and your
 
02:43:13.030 --> 02:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
management of the department so
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
if you could think of it as you know
 
02:43:18.550 --> 02:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
a two-way thing because i i'd like to
 
02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
have some insight into what is driving
 
02:43:23.750 --> 02:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
your decision making sure and we we
 
02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about that this
 
02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
morning um
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
at a pre-fiscal meeting around uh coming
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
with more of a strategy like a meeting
 
02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
where i can
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
lay out the strategy let's say for
 
02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
around mental health you know in all of
 
02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
the projects we have coming forward now
 
02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
that i could lay out more of a strategy
 
02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
rather than the individual project and
 
02:43:47.269 --> 02:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
although i often communicate with the
 
02:43:50.389 --> 02:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
chair or or with with senator morris i
 
02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
think having a a wider audience so that
 
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
you understand
 
02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
my strategy or the department's decision
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
making is more helpful for you
 
02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:03.510 align:start position:0%
making is more helpful for you
great

02:44:03.510 --> 02:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative earth oh it's just not
 
02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a big discussion
 
02:44:09.750 --> 02:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
this is a question go ahead
 
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
could you also provide the underlying
 
02:44:13.269 --> 02:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets then as well
 
02:44:16.389 --> 02:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
the underlying spreadsheets for
 
02:44:18.150 --> 02:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of these i assume a lot of these
 
02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:19.030 align:start position:0%
a lot of these i assume a lot of these
uh

02:44:19.030 --> 02:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:44:19.990 --> 02:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
elements of the dashboard are
 
02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and it should look like
 
02:44:21.359 --> 02:44:23.110 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and it should look like
spreadsheets

02:44:23.110 --> 02:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets
 
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of them come right from
 
02:44:27.510 --> 02:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
our budget um our budget
 
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
software but yes i we're gonna we're
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
gonna start from scratch so i'll see
 
02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
what i can provide and
 
02:44:37.269 --> 02:44:37.279 align:start position:0%
we can have many iterations of it
 
02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
if there's a question miss rounds can
 
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
okay i do have just one quick question
 
02:44:48.309 --> 02:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
and that is on
 
02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:53.279 --> 02:44:55.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:59.429 --> 02:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:02.389 --> 02:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
i can't understand
 
02:45:02.399 --> 02:45:03.990 align:start position:0%
i can't understand
why

02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:45:06.870 --> 02:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
since um
 
02:45:09.750 --> 02:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
the covid we had the large unemployment
 
02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:10.870 align:start position:0%
the covid we had the large unemployment
in

02:45:10.870 --> 02:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:45:10.880 --> 02:45:12.070 align:start position:0%
in
april

02:45:12.070 --> 02:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
april
 
02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
and it's continued to go up
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
i know that there's supposedly a thing
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
that says you can't
 
02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
have anybody leave
 
02:45:21.359 --> 02:45:22.070 align:start position:0%
have anybody leave
but

02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me that
 
02:45:24.479 --> 02:45:26.230 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me that
um

02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's getting to the it's getting to the
 
02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:35.110 --> 02:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
i i i obviously need to understand this
 
02:45:37.349 --> 02:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
better that that that is
 
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know the the issue is that during
 
02:45:41.429 --> 02:45:41.439 align:start position:0%
the federal public health emergency
 
02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
you're not able to take anybody off
 
02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:44.070 align:start position:0%
you're not able to take anybody off
medicaid

02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:46.389 align:start position:0%
medicaid
so

02:45:46.389 --> 02:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
because the public health emergency the
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
federal pub that the federal designation
 
02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
of the public health emergency is going
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
on for an extended period of time we do
 
02:45:57.030 --> 02:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
believe that the federal government is
 
02:45:58.950 --> 02:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
going to make a
 
02:46:01.269 --> 02:46:01.279 align:start position:0%
an effort to decouple those two things
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
so that we can start doing what we are
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
calling medicaid unwind which is taking
 
02:46:09.269 --> 02:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
people off medicaid very quickly so the
 
02:46:11.269 --> 02:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
increase that you see in medicaid and
 
02:46:13.110 --> 02:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
and case loads and things like that
 
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's what it is um through 20 and 21.
 
02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
but that's federally mandated no i got
 
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
that i guess that what um
 
02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:30.309 align:start position:0%
 
caseload

02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
caseload
 
02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
or the caseload has remained at about 12
 
02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
for ever
 
02:46:36.630 --> 02:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
anyhow that's enough of that but thank
 
02:46:40.710 --> 02:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
you very much for
 
02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%

02:50:37.110 --> 02:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
required communications okay thanks bob
 
02:50:38.870 --> 02:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
so that debt letter is just the one
 
02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
single page with a signature in the
 
02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
bottom and really the turnpike system
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
has to comply with certain provisions
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
and covenants in their general bond
 
02:50:49.110 --> 02:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
resolutions and so what we do as part of
 
02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
the audit is review those and we did not
 
02:50:52.950 --> 02:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
find any compliance issues
 
02:50:55.110 --> 02:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
um with the general them not complying
 
02:50:57.030 --> 02:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
with the general bond resolutions so
 
02:50:58.950 --> 02:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
again another favorable letter for the
 
02:51:01.429 --> 02:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
turnpike system
 
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
the second thing i want to do is again
 
02:51:05.110 --> 02:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
go through those required communications
 
02:51:07.349 --> 02:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
very similar to what i did last week
 
02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's just specific to the turnpike
 
02:51:10.469 --> 02:51:10.479 align:start position:0%
system because we're required to do
 
02:51:13.429 --> 02:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
these under aicpa auditing standards
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
the significant accounting policies of
 
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
the turnpike are described in note 1 of
 
02:51:18.550 --> 02:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
their annual report
 
02:51:20.150 --> 02:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
we did not identify any unusual
 
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
transactions throughout our audit
 
02:51:25.510 --> 02:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
the management has to come up with or
 
02:51:27.269 --> 02:51:27.279 align:start position:0%
make judgments over certain estimates
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
such as the allowance of doubtful
 
02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
accounts over the toll violations and we
 
02:51:32.469 --> 02:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
review these estimates and deem them to
 
02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
be reasonable
 
02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
in reasonable in light of the financial
 
02:51:38.469 --> 02:51:38.479 align:start position:0%
statements as a whole
 
02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
we did not have any disagreements with
 
02:51:42.070 --> 02:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
management or any scope limitations in
 
02:51:44.389 --> 02:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
completing our audit work
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
as far as we aware the turnpike did not
 
02:51:47.590 --> 02:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
seek other auditor's opinions on the
 
02:51:48.950 --> 02:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
application of generally accepted
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
accounting principles
 
02:51:53.030 --> 02:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
we did not discuss any major issues with
 
02:51:54.790 --> 02:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
management prior to our retention as
 
02:51:57.030 --> 02:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
their auditors
 
02:51:59.110 --> 02:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
we did receive full cooperation of the
 
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
staff and management from the turnpike
 
02:52:03.349 --> 02:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire audit
 
02:52:04.309 --> 02:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
we need to confirm that we're
 
02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
independent auditors of the turnpike
 
02:52:08.230 --> 02:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
system under relevant professional and
 
02:52:10.550 --> 02:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory standards
 
02:52:12.790 --> 02:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
and we did not identify any suspected or
 
02:52:14.550 --> 02:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
actual fraud involving management or
 
02:52:16.710 --> 02:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
those close to major components of
 
02:52:18.230 --> 02:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
internal control
 
02:52:19.910 --> 02:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
or where fraud resulted in a material
 
02:52:22.950 --> 02:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
misstatement of the financial statements
 
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
and we did not identify any material
 
02:52:26.790 --> 02:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
non-compliance related to laws or
 
02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:28.630 align:start position:0%
non-compliance related to laws or
regulations

02:52:28.630 --> 02:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
finally i have to inform you of an audit
 
02:52:33.349 --> 02:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
difference that we noted and this is one
 
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's been noted in the past few years
 
02:52:36.870 --> 02:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
and that's related to the liability for
 
02:52:38.870 --> 02:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
the opeb trusted plan
 
02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
and that is because the state has
 
02:52:42.309 --> 02:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
determined to record that liability
 
02:52:44.150 --> 02:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
entirely on their books because of the
 
02:52:46.309 --> 02:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
amount and not allocate the portion down
 
02:52:48.150 --> 02:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
to the turnpike so if the turnpike
 
02:52:49.990 --> 02:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
recorded that their oppeb liability
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
would be 1.2 million dollars higher
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
we assess that in regards to our
 
02:52:56.070 --> 02:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
materiality that we calculate and
 
02:52:57.670 --> 02:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
determine that it was not material that
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
it would affect our audit opinion on the
 
02:53:02.870 --> 02:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:04.950 --> 02:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
so any questions we would be happy to
 
02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
take those now
 
02:53:08.550 --> 02:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
no i i
 
02:53:10.870 --> 02:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
i thought the audit was
 
02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:12.150 align:start position:0%
i thought the audit was
great

02:53:12.150 --> 02:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:53:14.150 --> 02:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
all the all the comments did you have a
 
02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:18.950 align:start position:0%
all the all the comments did you have a
question

02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:21.830 --> 02:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on
 
02:53:23.830 --> 02:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
in the adam's on financial highlights
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
you noted that the revenues were
 
02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
decreasing you didn't you didn't
 
02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
you didn't in any way mention the
 
02:53:32.790 --> 02:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
cancellation of the tolls that we had
 
02:53:34.950 --> 02:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
eliminated tolls
 
02:53:37.830 --> 02:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think two times and one more time this
 
02:53:40.630 --> 02:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
i think january the the last told booth
 
02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
was cancelled
 
02:53:43.349 --> 02:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
when is that going to be considered in
 
02:53:45.990 --> 02:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
the report and that loss of revenue yeah
 
02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:49.269 align:start position:0%
the report and that loss of revenue yeah
so

02:53:49.269 --> 02:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:51.190 --> 02:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
is it on yes okay
 
02:53:53.590 --> 02:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
so the the loss of tolls the first time
 
02:53:55.670 --> 02:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
was in fiscal year 20
 
02:53:57.030 --> 02:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
and then the tolls that were just
 
02:53:59.349 --> 02:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
removed were in january a few weeks ago
 
02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
so that'll be fiscal year 22. so in
 
02:54:02.950 --> 02:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21
 
02:54:05.110 --> 02:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any toll removals that
 
02:54:07.269 --> 02:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
were part of that loss of revenue
 
02:54:09.349 --> 02:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
it was primarily related to coven and
 
02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
the reduced traffic of the turnpike
 
02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:11.750 align:start position:0%
the reduced traffic of the turnpike
system

02:54:11.750 --> 02:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
one other question from
 
02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
in the fact that we don't collect trolls
 
02:54:16.870 --> 02:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
between 10 o'clock at night and six
 
02:54:18.389 --> 02:54:18.399 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning what effect does
 
02:54:21.269 --> 02:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
that have on people running the toolbox
 
02:54:24.389 --> 02:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
well we do use all electronic tolling so
 
02:54:25.510 --> 02:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
we do
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
take pictures of the license plate and
 
02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:27.990 align:start position:0%
take pictures of the license plate and
then

02:54:27.990 --> 02:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:54:29.910 --> 02:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
they do have seven days where they can
 
02:54:32.550 --> 02:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
go into the system and pay it or we will
 
02:54:34.309 --> 02:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
send a bill out after those seven days
 
02:54:35.990 --> 02:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
and we send an invoice to their
 
02:54:37.830 --> 02:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
presidents to collect
 
02:54:39.750 --> 02:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you

the preparation and fair presentation of

02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
our auditor's opinion and report can be
 
02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:40.880 align:start position:0%

02:56:41.830 --> 02:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
and as described in the opinion
 
02:56:45.429 --> 02:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
paragraph on page 20 we've issued an
 
02:56:47.349 --> 02:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
unmodified or clean opinion on the
 
02:56:47.359 --> 02:56:48.630 align:start position:0%
unmodified or clean opinion on the
lottery's

02:56:48.630 --> 02:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
lottery's
 
02:56:50.630 --> 02:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
basic financial statements which also
 
02:56:51.830 --> 02:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
include the notes and other
 
02:56:54.790 --> 02:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
supplementary information
 
02:56:56.469 --> 02:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
while our opinion speaks directly to the
 
02:56:58.710 --> 02:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
basic financial statements and notes no
 
02:57:00.150 --> 02:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
matters came to our attention that
 
02:57:01.510 --> 02:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
caused us to believe that other
 
02:57:03.590 --> 02:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
information in the financial section of
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
the report was inconsistent with the
 
02:57:08.070 --> 02:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
basic financial statements
 
02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
auditing standards require we make a
 
02:57:11.830 --> 02:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
number of disclosures to you and these
 
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
disclosures were previously discussed by
 
02:57:16.230 --> 02:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
kpmg so in the interest of time i will
 
02:57:18.710 --> 02:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
not go through each of them individually
 
02:57:20.230 --> 02:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
however we can say that we were
 
02:57:22.150 --> 02:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the cooperation of the
 
02:57:24.309 --> 02:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
lottery and the progress of the audit
 
02:57:25.910 --> 02:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
and there is nothing that we need to
 
02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention related to any
 
02:57:31.429 --> 02:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
concerns with those required disclosures
 
02:57:33.510 --> 02:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
also included inside the back
 
02:57:35.590 --> 02:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
cover page of the report is a multi-page
 
02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:36.389 align:start position:0%

02:57:41.590 --> 02:57:41.600 align:start position:0%

of its lucky for life game
 
02:57:45.670 --> 02:57:45.680 align:start position:0%

02:57:51.910 --> 02:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
upon procedures performed with the
 
02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:53.279 align:start position:0%

and i would just like to point out two
 
03:03:19.510 --> 03:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
items on the table on page 17. you have
 
03:03:21.830 --> 03:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
under the distribution um the final
 
03:03:24.550 --> 03:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
transfer to the general fund was 164
 
03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
million which was 5 million more than
 
03:03:29.349 --> 03:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
the actual cash transfer for the fiscal
 
03:03:29.359 --> 03:03:30.309 align:start position:0%
the actual cash transfer for the fiscal
year

03:03:30.309 --> 03:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:03:32.469 --> 03:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
and this is resulting in a due to the
 
03:03:34.630 --> 03:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
general fund of 5 million dollars which
 
03:03:37.190 --> 03:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
we will be transferring next month
 
03:03:40.790 --> 03:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the other is a clerical era in fy 20
 
03:03:43.190 --> 03:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
column the 10 million dollars should be
 
03:03:45.030 --> 03:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
in the line above under the transfer to
 
03:03:46.870 --> 03:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
the alcohol abuse and prevention fund
 
03:03:49.269 --> 03:03:49.279 align:start position:0%

03:03:51.030 --> 03:03:51.040 align:start position:0%

03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:55.920 --> 03:03:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:03:57.510 --> 03:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:03:59.830 --> 03:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative edward you had a question
 
03:04:02.550 --> 03:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am thank you and i'm i'm
 
03:04:05.269 --> 03:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
horrible with names i'm the female
 
03:04:07.590 --> 03:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
auditor um
 
03:04:09.670 --> 03:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned that you had
 
03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
one i think you said you had one
 
03:04:13.429 --> 03:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
significant finding but no material
 
03:04:13.439 --> 03:04:14.630 align:start position:0%
significant finding but no material
findings

03:04:14.630 --> 03:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
findings
 
03:04:16.710 --> 03:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh but you had mentioned significant
 
03:04:18.630 --> 03:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
material as two different things would
 
03:04:20.950 --> 03:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
you would you remind me what the
 
03:04:24.070 --> 03:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
distinction is between those two terms
 
03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
sure if you go to our auditor's opinion
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
just layman's stuff is good okay um a
 
03:04:32.630 --> 03:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
material material weakness would be that
 
03:04:34.469 --> 03:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
during the normal course of business
 
03:04:36.070 --> 03:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
there could be a material misstatement
 
03:04:37.349 --> 03:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
in the financial statements that would
 
03:04:39.429 --> 03:04:39.439 align:start position:0%
go undetected
 
03:04:41.190 --> 03:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
um a significant difference and it's
 
03:04:42.870 --> 03:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
basically based on numbers so if you
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
have a hundred million dollar balance
 
03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
sheet for example materiality may be
 
03:04:49.110 --> 03:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
five percent of assets
 
03:04:50.870 --> 03:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
whereas significant difference may be a
 
03:04:52.309 --> 03:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
much lower number
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
so it's just okay so it's quant there's
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
a quantitative quantitative as well as a
 
03:04:58.389 --> 03:04:58.399 align:start position:0%
qualitative if there was like a fraud or
 
03:05:02.070 --> 03:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
something like that thank you yeah
 
03:05:04.070 --> 03:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
are there any uh representative
 
03:05:04.080 --> 03:05:06.230 align:start position:0%
are there any uh representative
leitchman

03:05:06.230 --> 03:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
leitchman

thank you madam chair and i guess a
 
03:05:14.790 --> 03:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
question for tina if you would like take
 
03:05:14.800 --> 03:05:15.910 align:start position:0%
question for tina if you would like take
it

03:05:15.910 --> 03:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:05:18.630 --> 03:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh on page 30
 
03:05:18.640 --> 03:05:19.510 align:start position:0%
uh on page 30
uh

03:05:19.510 --> 03:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:05:21.990 --> 03:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
there's a section at the bottom do uh
 
03:05:26.469 --> 03:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
bonds payable maturity see that
 
03:05:27.910 --> 03:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
i was just
 
03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
curious the
 
03:05:35.269 --> 03:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
range of interest shows from 2 to 9.5
 
03:05:37.830 --> 03:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
have you folks been able to
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh negotiate any better rates or are
 
03:05:42.550 --> 03:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
those pretty much locked in
 
03:05:44.070 --> 03:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
those are locked in and it's done
 
03:05:46.150 --> 03:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
through treasury right i didn't know if
 
03:05:47.429 --> 03:05:47.439 align:start position:0%
treasury had reached out or you had
 
03:05:49.030 --> 03:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
reached out to treasury to see if you
 
03:05:51.349 --> 03:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
could modify them i know treasury has
 
03:05:53.349 --> 03:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
made some adjustments on other bonds for
 
03:05:55.670 --> 03:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
the state so i was curious oh we have
 
03:05:57.510 --> 03:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
not okay
 
03:05:59.750 --> 03:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
and just i guess one final question
 
03:05:59.760 --> 03:06:00.790 align:start position:0%
and just i guess one final question
certainly

03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:06:02.950 --> 03:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
could you speak to the debt service i
 
03:06:04.230 --> 03:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
see that's
 
03:06:04.240 --> 03:06:06.630 align:start position:0%
see that's
uh

03:06:06.630 --> 03:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:09.910 --> 03:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
pretty high 4.9 is and if you travel
 
03:06:11.190 --> 03:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
down through it
 
03:06:11.200 --> 03:06:12.550 align:start position:0%
down through it
uh

03:06:12.550 --> 03:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:06:14.710 --> 03:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
it's remained you know of a
 
03:06:17.269 --> 03:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
fairly high lease in my opinion any real
 
03:06:19.510 --> 03:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
reason for that um new building
 
03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
construction i know you've put up some
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
new facilities is that driving that
 
03:06:26.830 --> 03:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
obviously that in our new pos
 
03:06:29.750 --> 03:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
