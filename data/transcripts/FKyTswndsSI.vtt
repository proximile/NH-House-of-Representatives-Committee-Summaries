everybody here some research which I've
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
done regarding the back half and the
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
issue um where do the academic standards
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%

with research across the
 
00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 align:start position:0%
street and and also had a lengthy
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
discussion with the commission of
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%

and and he discussed the areas which we
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
had con I had concern we had concern and
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
I have some feedback on that but I'd
 
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
like to First Look at the back half here
 
00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:58.879 align:start position:0%
and what we have in statutory law right
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
now and why we have it in statutory
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
law Jen I do have some sheets here for
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
gathering you're
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
welcome if you're looking at at that
 
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
sheet right now we had this discussion
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
where do academic standards belong so we
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
don't have to get into this long
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
discussion and debate again today
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
just looking at it in and starting in
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
1998 there was a bill passed and signed
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
in law it was HB
 
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
1075 this is back
 
00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:46.759 align:start position:0%
before we had the current definitions of
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
everything that we have right now this
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
was a bill that created RSA 193 and at
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
that time there was no
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
193e they created RSA 193 E1 2 and 3 193
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
appeared on two pages in the statory
 
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
books following this this bill so we've
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
significantly added to it um as of 1998
 
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
the term academic standards did not
 
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
exist in
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
statute HB 1075 contained the three
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
sections of an adequate
 
00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639 align:start position:0%
education and contain two paragraphs and
 
00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
I put them both down below there one
 
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
reads New
 
00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in New Hampshire that public
 
00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:37.959 align:start position:0%
education and secondary education shall
 
00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
provide all students with the
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to acquire the Knowledge and
 
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:43.640 align:start position:0%

free government now in the years to come
 
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
that's sort of what we have today but
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
then they had an education that is
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
consistent with a curriculum and student
 
00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:03.079 align:start position:0%

Frameworks that's how it was said back
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
then the student proficiency standards
 
00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
are are term which have since been
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
changed to education standards and then
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
to academic standards by the legislature
 
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
in subsequent
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
years respecting New Hampshire's long
 
00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
traditional Community involvement it is
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this chapter the new 193
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure that appropriate means are
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
established to provide an adequate
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
education through an integral system of
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
shared responsibility between between
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
the state and local government we have
 
00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:41.959 align:start position:0%
that in law in this system and this is
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
what they put in there in this system
 
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
the state establishes through school
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
approval and student proficiency
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
standards and curriculum guides the
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
framework for the delivery of
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
educational services at the local level
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
so through a school approval and student
 
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
proficiency standards again echoing the
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
the those standards now there's nine
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
steps I think I yeah nine nine steps
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
what I put in here it's trying to get to
 
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
from where we were back then and if you
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
go into the office here and look at our
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
the 1998 statutory law you'll see those
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
two paragraphs I just
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
read going down this number one the Bold
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
underlying sentences identify the
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
student proficiency standards
 
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
were what is called today academic
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
standards number two that an adequate
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
education is consistent with the
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
curriculum and student proficiency
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
standards specified in in State School
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%

curriculum
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
Frameworks so proficiency students are
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
in according to this the New Hampshire
 
00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:53.959 align:start position:0%
curriculum standards number three
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
statute reflected that student
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
proficiency standards are specified in
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
approval rules and the curriculum
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
Frameworks four student proficiency
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
standards now called academic standards
 
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
are in those curriculum Frameworks in
 
00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
2016 all references to curriculum
 
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
Frameworks were removed from Statute in
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
2016 student proficiency standards were
 
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
replaced with new terminology called
 
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
academic standards academic standards
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
were defin defined as meaning what a
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
student should know and be to do at each
 
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.269 align:start position:0%
student should know and be to do at each
grade

00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
grade
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
level going further from 26 216 with the
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
removal of Frameworks over the next
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
years confusion existed as to where
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
academic standards could be found and
 
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
confusion is a word that I think we is
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
really reflective of what we've been
 
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839 align:start position:0%
trying to do up here at times trying to
 
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
find the location where these things are
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to be by 2024 the term academic
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
standards has further changed academic
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
standards means what a student should
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
know and be able to do in a course or at
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
each grade level that was added in
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
slightly different from
 
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
2016 number eight in 2024 the
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
legislature and recognition that by
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
implementing statutory reference to

curriculum Frameworks the leure had
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
legislature had also deleted reference
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
to where academic standards SL student
 
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
proficient standards could be located
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
that back referencing back to
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
2016 the legislator passed 1107 we just
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
recently did placing curriculum
 
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
Frameworks back in the statute in RSA
 
00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:40.710 align:start position:0%

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
193
 
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
e2a the following definitions now in law
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum framework means an organized
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
plan of study that serves as a guide and
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
reference to what New Hampshire students
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
should know and be able to do in
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
learning in a learning area and
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
identifies the academic St standards
 
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
aligned with each learning area pursuant
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
to RSA 1932a 1A in summary academic
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
standards are meant to be in and
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
identified within the curriculum
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
Frameworks academic standards for
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
learning content areas identified in
 
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.430 align:start position:0%
learning content areas identified in
that

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
RSA U belong in the Frameworks not
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
administrative rules the administrative
 
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
rules and Frameworks are linked by
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
reference so that's how you know I've
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
gone through and tried to do that
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
research along with research people
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
across the street and looking at the
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
statutes that we've had from 1998 going
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
forward um so that's where we stand and
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
my my my feeling right now is that we
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
know where the academic standards are
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to be they're supposed to be
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
located in the Frameworks and referenc
 
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
to those
 
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:52.759 align:start position:0%
Frameworks there's a link so in the
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
future when we modify these rules we are
 
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
also impacting academic
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
standards so I'll open up to discussion
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
here yes represent cellan well thank you
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
um for uh doing that research with OS I
 
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's helpful and provides uh
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
context um for this um and I think
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
context was also one of the words used
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner um was it last week
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
in talking about the the Frameworks and
 
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
en Compass the standards um and maybe in
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
a couple of the Frameworks the the title
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
was uh guide rather than Frameworks but
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
um I think that the uh intent is there
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
and I think um including uh the
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
Frameworks by
 
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
reference um and possibly in the
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
appendix um is
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh the proper um
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
alignment of things uh so I am U fine
 
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
with uh what has been
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
proposed represent Luna um sure um thank
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair I'm I'm certainly
 
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
not fine with what's been proposed
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
because we haven't even begin uh to uh
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
review the um the the list of um of uh
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
you know concerns that uh that we had
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
that that were presented and discussed
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
during the the last meeting on October
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh 21st so so I think um I think we're
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
jumping the gun um to say that that
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
we're ready to to go forward with this
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
without first um having those concerns
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
addressed I'm I'm frankly I'm I'm
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
shocked that there's nobody from the
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
Department uh here to uh to help us um
 
00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:54.519 align:start position:0%
uh where we can inquire with the
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
department and get some answers to uh to
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
these concerns um I think it continues
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
to show their callous disregard to the
 
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
legislative process which is required in
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
statute and uh and frankly is required
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
by JL car as well and uh and given the
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
the that JL car uh will certainly
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
consider uh the public interest as being
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
being uh important when there's nobody
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department to answer questions
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
from Representatives who represent the
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
public I think this is a clear violation
 
00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:30.759 align:start position:0%
of um of a process that uh that avoided
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
the um uh that that contradicts to the
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
to the public interest so um so I hope
 
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do this morning is
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
um is see some people from the
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
department and there's nobody here right
 
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
now and um and that we can get some
 
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
answers to um to the questions that uh
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
that came out of the um the uh came out
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
of our last meeting and uh and you know
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
not not only did we have questions that
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
were related to the definitions but
 
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:05.799 align:start position:0%
questions that were related to the rules
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh themselves and um and also I think
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
questions related to the impact that um
 
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
that requiring compliance with um with
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
with Frameworks um which are now in the
 
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
um uh you know it's now required in the
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh in the back half of the rules when uh
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
when Frameworks are defined even as most
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
recently as House Bill 1107 which was
 
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
signed in the law and went into effect
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
on September 10th that uh discusses the
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
framework say guide and reference so so
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
I you know I think there's there's
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot we need to do to
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
understand what um what the impact would
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
be on um on on our schools and and I
 
00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:00.039 align:start position:0%
think you know at the at the 30,000 foot
 
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
level Mr
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
chair and the governor even said this in
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
his um State of the State address in
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
February that that New Hampshire's
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
Public Schools public school students
 
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
perform among the best in the country
 
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
and um and we've talked about this
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
before I know it doesn't happen
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
everywhere but on average um New
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public School students perform
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
the best in the country what's going to
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
be the impact on um on on that on those
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
student outcomes given these new rules
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
and uh I think we need to take a very
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
careful and thoughtful approach as we
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
move forward here uh the fact that
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
there's nobody here from the Department
 
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh to answer questions in the public
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
appalling okay i' I'd like to just you
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
know roll back to
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
where why I read through this report
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
that I put together trying to go through
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
the history of it yes our our students
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
in this state compared the rest of the
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
country do very very well in terms of
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
academic achievement and performance and
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
growth where I want to really get
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
clarified here and to me it's a
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
legislative responsibility to clarify
 
00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:18.039 align:start position:0%
this not the Department's responsibility
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
to clarify where are these academic
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
standards found when I went back and
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
looked at the 2001 ccum Frameworks for
 
00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:30.669 align:start position:0%
looked at the 2001 ccum Frameworks for
the

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
Arts and I saw within that clear
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
reference clear
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
identification what standards are it was
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
there standard one standard two standard
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
three when I looked at other aspects of
 
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
these Frameworks I also saw that in the
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
health there are some Frameworks which
 
00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:53.870 align:start position:0%
health there are some Frameworks which
we

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
have that need cleanup I will concur
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
100% on that there are Frameworks which
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
were adopted just recently like or not
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
recently but in recent years here like
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
the the the mathematics standards those
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
are referenced very well too to clear
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
standards science a little different but
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
it also has reference to those
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
overarching performance standards that
 
00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:24.919 align:start position:0%
we want students to achieve in those
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
science areas so the if there's anything
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
that comes out in terms of a policy
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation I would say that it's up
 
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
to the legislature to say these
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks need to be
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the department be it through
 
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
a task force through department
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
administration at least every 10 years
 
00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
to update and to ensure that they're
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
reflective of what we have in statute we
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
do have in statute and I'm thoroughly
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
believing that now based upon how we
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
defined performance student proficiency
 
00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
standards changed it to education
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
standards prior to 2000 you know when we
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
were doing No Child Left Behind which
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
kind of messed us up too and then we've
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
gone to the academic standards I think
 
00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
we have to decide where these things are
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
located yes there's other things we need
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
to discuss today but we need to get past
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
this hurdle that the academic standards
 
00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:26.919 align:start position:0%
are to be located in the curriculum
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
Frameworks they can be reference from
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
rule to
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
those but we need to be able to say to
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
our Educators out in the field here's
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
where you go to find the academic
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
standards yeah and Mr chair and I'm I'm
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
in agreement with that I think that that
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense because when the
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner was here uh a few weeks ago
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
he referred to the AC he referred to the
 
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
Frameworks as the academic standards as
 
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to containing the academic
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
standards well just to clarify that when
 
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
I met with him on Friday down in Kean he
 
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
said they are housed in the curriculum
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
Frameworks they are the curriculum
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are not they contain the
 
00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
standards as well as other guidelines in
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
terms of how to integrate those
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
Frameworks into curriculum and and thank
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
you that's a very good clarification
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
from what from what what I heard yeah uh
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
during that um during the time when the
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner was um was here but but
 
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
just going back to the Arts and I know
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
we talk about the Arts framework because
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
it's the very first rule in the back
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
half rules and I think it's you know we
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
we discuss it as exemplary you know for
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
all of the other ones as well but the
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
Arts framework and and this was also
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
discussed um uh during that uh during
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
that meeting a few weeks ago the Arts
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
framework has not been updated since
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
2001 and um and so what are we losing by
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
by now requiring not only that uh that
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh that public schools incorporate the
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
academic standards from that 2001
 
00:23:17.269 --> 00:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
framework but now also the um the
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum and competencies aligned with
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
that 2001 framework that would seem to
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
me to be taking a step back um you know
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
using a framework that was constructed
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know um uh 23 years ago uh uh uh so
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know what are we losing with that
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
what are the costs associated with uh
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
with implementing uh curriculum and um
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
curriculum that's aligned to a 23y old
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
framework uh uh and doing that in every
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
Public School across the state do we do
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and I guess do we even have a
 
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note uh impact on what these
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
rules would cost to imploy go to Katie
 
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
first representative pen no yes thank
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um just have a question
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
I want to clarify the purpose of our
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
committee and we are to review and make
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
recommendations is that correct that's
 
00:24:15.919 --> 00:24:17.070 align:start position:0%
recommendations is that correct that's
correct

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
so part of our recommendations could be
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
that the curriculum um Frameworks be
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
updated I mean I agree 23 years old 23
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
years is a long time but maybe next in
 
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
the process is the
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
re-evaluation and rewriting of the
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks to come up to
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
Modern stand but that's part of our
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation that's not in the purview
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
of our committee here to start reviewing
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
the curriculum framework that's correct
 
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
we're getting into the business policy
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
and and that's our responsibility yes
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
but we're looking at these which we're
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
looking at statutory reference that the
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
Frameworks contain and house the
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
academic standards now just because
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
academic standards were written 20 30
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
years ago doesn't mean they're outdated
 
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily and so in in looking at some
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
of the standards we've looked at them
 
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
when we talked about health and we were
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
looking for mental health which are also
 
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
in the academic curriculum or the
 
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.789 align:start position:0%
in the academic curriculum or the
curriculum

00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and I believe they spoke to
 
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
the issues which we needed to have a
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
reference point when we're looking at
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
legislation last year dealing with
 
00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
mental health and how it's done in the
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
schools so I I think we're we're leaping
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
if we and I agree with you
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative peternell that maybe it's
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
there was an effort back when this first
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
bill HP
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
1075 there were numerous amendments that
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
came in from various directions one of
 
00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799 align:start position:0%
those amendments was also looking at
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
should there be a time frame in which
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks are reviewed and
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
and looked at that didn't go forward at
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
that time so I I concur with what you
 
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
just said represent P represent luno
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
yeah so um you we we do have that in
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
statute now that curriculum framework
 
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
should be um uh reviewed and updated uh
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
on on every 10year cycle that was that
 
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
was part of uh of House Bill 1107 that
 
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
that um that we passed this year but uh
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
but given that that the the the back
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
half of the rules the the rules that
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
pertain to academic standards are
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
replacing what's in rule right now with
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
a requirement for public schools to um
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
to uh uh to have their compasses and
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
curriculums shall shall align with the
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum framework for the Arts in
 
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
this case April 2001 edition uh since it
 
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't been updated in 23 years aren't
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
we sort of put in the cart before the
 
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
horse should we update the Frameworks
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
first before requiring compliance to
 
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
Frameworks that are over 20 years old
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you I I would
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
just um observe that uh I don't think
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
nothing in here is changing the
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
standards the standards have been the
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
standards um nothing is changing the
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
standards that we have in place um
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
should they be reviewed uh probably so
 
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
um and that is um in statute now but I I
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that anything in here that
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to review is actually
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
changing the standards that are already
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
in place oh sure Mr chair yes represent
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
pel I I I kind of get the sense that
 
00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
what representative luno is suggesting
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
is sort of the cart driving the horse so
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
if we look at
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
statute um defining um giving allowance
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
for rules and then that leads down to
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
the iic standards and the curriculum
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and then the curriculum at
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
the bottom if you will a pyramid we're
 
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
we're setting up the process to move in
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
the appropriate manner we can't um
 
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
create the curriculum Frameworks unless
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
we have the rules to direct the
 
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks is that am I not
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
is there something there that I'm not
 
00:28:21.389 --> 00:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly in that process
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so so uh yeah thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
and and thank you representative pel um
 
00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:30.519 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the curriculum
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are defined in statute um and
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
and that definition was was um clarified
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 1107 that we passed this
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
year and so so the um the what what a
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum framework
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
is is defined in um in statute what what
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
we're considering here isn't statutory
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
it's rules and and to change the rules
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
to that that did not require did not
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
mandate public schools to to implement
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum uh the curriculum
 
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.110 align:start position:0%
curriculum uh the curriculum
Frameworks

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
Frameworks
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
um where now the proposed rules would be
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
that schools have to comply with the
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
with the curriculum Frameworks seems to
 
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
be out of order that that that going
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
going back to your very good analogy
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
that curriculum Frameworks are the
 
00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
foundation of the um of the of the
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
pyramid here that that those should be
 
00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.110 align:start position:0%
pyramid here that that those should be
developed

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
first followed by the rule you know and
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
approval of those Frameworks which I
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
think is is um is subject to uh to the
 
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
state board and to this committee and
 
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
then rules that rely on those uh
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
Frameworks that would be mod ified next
 
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
and U uh as opposed to starting at the
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
top of the pyramid and uh and I I mean I
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
just think we're we're doing this in the
 
00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:08.990 align:start position:0%
just think we're we're doing this in the
wrong

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
order um represent pno thank you I think
 
00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
representative luno and I have a
 
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
disagreement about the purpose of the
 
00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919 align:start position:0%
pyramid and I understand his reference
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
to building the pyramid from the bottom
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
up because you certainly wouldn't start
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
from the top but that's not how our
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
legislative process works we start at
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
the top and everything funnels down to
 
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.509 align:start position:0%
the top and everything funnels down to
the

00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
bottom but but this and I I'm I'm sorry
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
this is turning into debate what we're
 
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
talking about here is rules not not
 
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
statute so so this
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
is this committee has a legis has a
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to recommend to review
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
and recommend uh rules and and
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm not talking about
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislative our legislative
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
responsibilities when it comes to
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
statutes um talking about our this
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee's responsibility to review and
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
recommend rule changes and uh and
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
frankly the Frameworks because that's
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
now in here too so so it
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
would appear to me um and you know that
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
that that we would start with the framew
 
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
Works make sure that the Frameworks are
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
are um you know make sense that they're
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
updated that they're that that they uh
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
are are going to um you know do well for
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
our for our students and then update the
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
rules accordingly to refer to those
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
Frameworks as opposed to updating the
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
rules first to refer to outdated
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
Frameworks that haven't been looked at
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
in in in some cases in 20 plus years
 
00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:00.919 align:start position:0%
ref s Celli yeah I I think that uh to
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
say that uh they haven't been looked at
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
in 20 some odd years um there was a
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
process that the uh uh department and
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
the board state board went through um
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
Consulting with many people um
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
Educators um and citizens alike and um
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
part of that my understanding is they
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
did look at um some people at least in
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
the department reviewed um those
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and those standards and U in
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
some cases probably they did but also I
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
think we heard that some of the uh the
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
art uh uh standards that were discussed
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
um seemed uh quite uh quite good um at
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
this point even though they're 20 years
 
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
old but um I I don't
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
see um we're in these rules making a
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
reference to Frameworks uh
 
00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
um uh do we change the rules every time
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
in every 10 years that we change the
 
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
Frameworks it's just a reference to the
 
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
Frameworks the Frameworks are going to
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
change um as time
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
requires um so I I don't think that we
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
need to change uh the rules other than
 
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:23.720 align:start position:0%
the reference to the framework so I I
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
think that uh the process that we are
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
going through is the one in terms of
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
updating the the rules to make sure that
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
they are referencing the Frameworks and
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
therefore the standards but I I think
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
that um certainly 10 years ago we had
 
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of discussion about math and
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
English uh standards when Common Core
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
was adopted by the then State Board of
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
Education and uh some of those dis
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
discussions continue today so um at
 
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
least for those standards there has been
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
ongoing review um since that they were
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
proposed and adopted by the state
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
board and at that time the math
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
standards came before the Improvement
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
assessment uh group and they were
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
approved by this committee at that time
 
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
yes thanks thanks very much to
 
00:34:26.829 --> 00:34:26.839 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's um um comments
 
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
I you know I appreciate the fact that
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
that he feels that the that the Arts
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are up to-date and good and
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
relevant stuff like that but there's
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
nobody here from the Department to
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
actually ask them what they did to
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
review the Frameworks prior to
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
incorporating all of the Frameworks into
 
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
the um into the minimum standards for
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
for school approval so we just don't
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
know there's nobody here from the
 
00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
Department to testif testify on that and
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
then and then
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
further and I think the department could
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
have organized this too are some content
 
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
experts to actually you know attest to
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
what representative cordelli suggested
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh which is the relevance of those 2001
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
Frameworks there's nobody here that can
 
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:21.079 align:start position:0%
um that can testify to the um to the the
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
significance of how those Frameworks
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
relate to what students should know and
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
at what grade level uh by course uh uh
 
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
we we there's nobody from the Department
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
here represent L we're we're looking at
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
though the academic standards student
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
proficiency standards call it what you
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
may they are located in the curriculum
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and when I'm looking at even
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
Part B within 30627 which is Arts
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
education it says each school's Arts
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
education program shall have
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
competencies and curriculum aligned to
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
two k through 12 curriculum Frameworks
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
for the Arts April 2001 edition as
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
reference in a appendix
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
2 now whether the the Frameworks have
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
been updated or not or reviewed or not
 
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
that's not a question before this
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
committee at this point in time the
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
question is does this change in
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
rule accurately reference the the or
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
direct the educator the field to where
 
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
they can find that content you're
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the content now is within
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
those standards and Frameworks it's not
 
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.390 align:start position:0%
those standards and Frameworks it's not
in

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
Rule and so you know I I I I don't
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
really have a problem with the way it's
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
written Mr chair yes thank you um I in
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
reference to your um Point number six on
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
the second page one of the um topics
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
that I did find confusing until the
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
introduction of 110 of um House Bill 11
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
7 was what how were um school districts
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
educating their students without the
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks over the last what
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
was their guideline what were they doing
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
so I think your point number six is
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
clarified with the proposed ed3 306
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
rules and the addition of House Bill
 
00:37:21.069 --> 00:37:21.079 align:start position:0%
1107 because there when I look at it I'm
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
confused what were schools using as
 
00:37:26.309 --> 00:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
their guideline for their curriculum
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
statute sir further discussion on this
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
issue I don't think just just finally so
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are in statute now and it
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
says that they are to be used as a guide
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
and reference in statute and then the
 
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
proposed rule says the program sh um
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
shall have competencies in curriculum
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
shall so it's a mandate so the statute
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh says that the curriculum Frameworks
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
are a guide and reference and the
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
proposed rule says that the curriculum
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are a mandate that's those
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
are two different things so wearing our
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
our our um you know lawmaker hats uh the
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
rules are in conflict with the law the
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
law says their references the rules
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
suggest the rules sorry the proposed
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
rules say that they're um their mandates
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day the um the you
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
know the statute says that school
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
districts shall use the Frameworks as a
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
guide and a reference not as a mandate
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
so so I there it's it's there they're
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
not um you know they're not just
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
floating off in
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
space but again that statutory language
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
which we passed you the first part is
 
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
correct but it says
 
00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
should and it goes on should know and be
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:38:58.109 --> 00:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
do and those Frameworks are aligned and
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
contained the academic standards so the
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
the statute that we have in place I
 
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
think very accurately says you shall do
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
this and he says should okay yeah we can
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
always say change should from Sha to
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
shall um but we you know I'm looking
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
back to when it was initially put
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
forward and back in
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
1998 and it says School approval and
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
student proficiency standards and
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum guidelines the framework for
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
delivery of Education Services at the
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
means uh where yeah and it says right at
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph there in 1998 shall
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
provide all students with the
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to acquire the Knowledge and
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
Skills necess necessary to provide them
 
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
for successful
 
00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.550 align:start position:0%
for successful
participation

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.309 --> 00:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
um I I I think it's pretty clear to me
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
as to what they're doing here the the
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
rules are not the
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
standards and I think we've got to
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate that confusion and saying
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
you'll find those standards in their
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
Frameworks now Frameworks need work then
 
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
that the department needs to get on the
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
horses and do it but that's not or we
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
through policy would direct them to do
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
it uh legislation I don't think that's
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
necessary that's their responsibility
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
that's the state board's
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility and I think I believe the
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
State Board is moving in that direction
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
what we probably need to do is support
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
them with the curriculum staff to do it
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair given given what you just
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
said why would we adopt rules or
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
recommend adopting rules that refer to
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks that need
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
work and that should be upd
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
why why would we do that why wouldn't we
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
start with the Frameworks and and get
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
them settled to where where you know and
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
this a State Board responsibility we
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
review and recommend get the get the
 
00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
framework settled to where um where they
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
should be school districts are already
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
um it's already in statute that they use
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
them as a guide and a
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
reference um uh uh to what New Hampshire
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
students should know I'm reading from
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
the law and be able to in a learning
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
area and identifies the academic
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
standards align with that um um uh
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
learning area why wouldn't we why
 
00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.030 align:start position:0%
learning area why wouldn't we why
wouldn't

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
we recommend the State Board start there
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
and then um uh and then once those are
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
settled uh put those Frameworks into U
 
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
reference those Frameworks through rules
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
because the rules are the minimum
 
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
standards I think that's what the state
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
board's trying to do I think they're
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
trying to file what hb17 s said and what
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
previous legislation has said and now
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
they're saying yes if you want to find
 
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
these standards they are located over
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
here in the curriculum Frameworks
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
they're they're just doing it backwards
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
you according to our current
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
statute there's a requirement to follow
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
the current curriculum
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
Frameworks so I'm not sure what
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
difference it makes whether they update
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
the curriculum Frameworks before we
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
adopt these rules or after because
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
either way they're now required to
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
follow those curriculum Frameworks
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
so why would we undo all of the work
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
that the department and the board of
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
education has done on these rules and
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
set them back how many more years these
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
rules will be will have to be reopt as
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
written without any new
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations am I am I missing
 
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
something in that
 
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
process represent cor I I don't think
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
you are missing anything um and I just
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
go back to the point that the
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
Frameworks contain the AC St academic
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
standards and the academic standards
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
have not changed they have been and
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
continue to be the standards to which
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum is to be aligned at the local
 
00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.750 align:start position:0%
curriculum is to be aligned at the local
level

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:43:28.349 --> 00:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
period And if those academic standards
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
are to be changed that's a
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the State Board of
 
00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.670 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the State Board of
Education

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
correct so Mr chair I'm missing
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
something here
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
um you said the academics if the
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
academic standards are to be changed
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
that's the responsibility of the State
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
Board of Education but you you missed
 
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
something over that only after review
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
and recommendation by this committee so
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
we have a role in in this um whether
 
00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
that and that includes a role in in
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
reviewing and recommending the minimum
 
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
academic the academic standards we now
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
have a role in reviewing and
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
recommending the um the minimum
 
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
standards for school approval and the
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
Frameworks those are the two things that
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
came out of house bill 11
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
1107 so so to say that the state board
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
has unilateral Authority
 
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
to or to suggest that the state board
 
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
has unilateral authority to modify to
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
change the academic standards is
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely contrary to um no no but it's
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
contrary to uh
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
e2a um um Roman 4C the State Board shall
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
not amend any existing academic
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
standards and Sh shall not approve any
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
new academic standards without the prior
 
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
review and recommendation of the
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee this
 
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
committee and that's that's how
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
important the legislature uh felt back
 
00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:08.839 align:start position:0%
uh back back when this um uh provision
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
was um was adopted that that that the
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
State Board doesn't act alone in this um
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
uh the the State Board is not
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
unilaterally adopting academic standards
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a process a procedure
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
in which that would occur now when they
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
want to look at the Arts education again
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
and change current standards then we
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to review and
 
00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
recommend those standards back to the
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
state board but that's not what they're
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
doing right now they're saying we're in
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
we're locating those according to the
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
way we've written this 306 is that
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to be located they are
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
located over in the Frameworks they're
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
not Chang in the academic
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
standards and that's where we have the
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity as a legislature to review
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
and recommend when they do make those
 
00:46:08.589 --> 00:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
changes but there's no changes occurring
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
here oh sure yes there are because what
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
they're and again just looking at at um
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
at what was formerly rule 30631 ARS
 
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
education now
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
30627 um the what's in the existing rule
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
is being being deleted and the proposed
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
rule is replacing that with the with a
 
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
requ with a mandated compliance to a
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
framework and the framework has
 
00:46:40.109 --> 00:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
different language than what's in the um
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
the current rule it's absolutely
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
different there was no requirement to uh
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
to uh to to there was no mandate to have
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
um uh uh curriculum and
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
competencies compliant with the the
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks it said in statute
 
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
that they're a guide and a reference and
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and so that is that's changing uh so
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
and and and the words are changing too
 
00:47:11.549 --> 00:47:11.559 align:start position:0%
what was what was in the the what's in
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
the existing rule is being replaced by a
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
u u you know uh uh a curriculum
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
framework that was adopted back in
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
2001 represent cell yeah uh going back
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
to the 1107 language there are two
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
pieces to it first is that the
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are a guide and a reference
 
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
to what they should students should know
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
not shall but should know that's a whole
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
different discussion what they shall
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
know uh but the second part is the
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
Frameworks identify the academic
 
00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:51.079 align:start position:0%
standards and that's all we are trying
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
to or the department is trying to do and
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
us via our review is is to put into
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
rules I think what has been um a de
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
facto rule uh if not um more than that
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
but that curriculum is to be aligned to
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
the standards we we've talked about that
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
in relation to um the standards for
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
years um uh I know with common core
 
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:24.839 align:start position:0%
standards there's been great debate and
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
we said that uh um
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh districts had to align to the state
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
standards or higher standards if they
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to develop something higher than
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
the state minimum standard academic
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
standards um I think Manchester did do
 
00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:47.079 align:start position:0%
that didn't they revise the um was the
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
math common core standards and upgrade
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
them to what they thought was higher
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
level so I I think that nothing has
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
changed in that regard we've always been
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
um trying to align curriculum to
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
academic standards and this is just
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
aligning the rules to point to those
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
Frameworks further discussion on this
 
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean this is it is the cart
 
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
before the horse it is doing it
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
backwards modifying these rules um to uh
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
to sit on top of a shaky Foundation is
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
forward I would disagree with you're
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
saying it's on a shaky Foundation
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
obviously over the last years our
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
students in this state have done very
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
well academically based upon the
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
standards we have in place the academic
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
standards or student Prof proficiency
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
standards as they were initially
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
called um that's not Shaky Ground uh
 
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is eliminating
 
00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
confusion as to where you find these
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
academic standards the academic
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
standards are properly located as was
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
decided back in
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
1998 and messed by us roundwood in the
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
legislature numerous times and changed
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
the names of this you know it's been
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
student proficiency standards back when
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
No Child Left Behind was in in play and
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
we're looking at that and revising to go
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
into the current Elementary secondary
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
Education Act it went to education
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
standards then academic
 
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
standards um all basically just the same
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
thing and and so I think this is really
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
clarifying the process where you will
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
find they are housed in the curriculum
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
Frameworks we're not changing it that is
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
another issue if that's going to occur
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
and that's up to the State Board to make
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
that decision the Department of
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
Education working with the state board
 
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
and the State Board working with schools
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
in the state if they want to come
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
forward with a recommendation or new set
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
of art standards or other subject area
 
00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:10.799 align:start position:0%
learning area sub as standards do so and
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
we they will come before us for our
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
review and recommendation but that's a
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
step down the road right now we're
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
making sure the procedure is in place Mr
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
chair represent pel yes thank you very
 
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
much at the end of the day um I find it
 
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:27.799 align:start position:0%
offensive that representative luno
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
speaks to a shaky Foundation because I
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
find that comment to be undermining all
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
of our local Educators because
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
regardless of the decisions that you
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
make here and now they're the ones in
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
the classrooms they're the ones teaching
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
their students and saying that the
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
foundation is shaky is undermining the
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
trust that the parents and the public
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
have in their Educators and any quality
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
educator knows exactly what their
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
students should be learning at each and
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
every grade level and in each and every
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
course that they are taking and I find
 
00:51:59.789 --> 00:51:59.799 align:start position:0%
it offensive that we're undermining the
 
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
shaky Foundation of our quality
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities for students
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and I find
 
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
a high value in our local Educators and
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
they should be applauded for the work
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
that they do every single day for the
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
students in our
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
state and I I would just chirp in on
 
00:52:22.109 --> 00:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
that I don't think we have a shaky
 
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
Foundation we allow flexibility for our
 
00:52:27.549 --> 00:52:27.559 align:start position:0%
loal schools and that I think was
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
reflected back in the 1998 law there
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
yeah school districts then have
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility in implementing diverse
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
instructional approaches Mr chair I'd
 
00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
like to just um respond to um to that
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
comment um again I I think what's
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
offensive and has undermined public
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
confidence is the fact that the
 
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education nor any um me
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
hey I'm speaking point of order you I
 
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
find discouraging comments about the
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
right now from the Department to answer
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
any questions that uh that this
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
committee may have and I believe we have
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
a number of technical questions uh on
 
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
this subject and uh and that uh that
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
that process has really undermined
 
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
public confidence in this matter well I
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
I I disagree 100% with you on that uh
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
represent luno uh the I met with the
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner we spent over an hour hour
 
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
and a half looking at and we have
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
another sheet which I want to go through
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
and look at on the front side that he's
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
unable to be here today yes I thought
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
Julie Shay would be here however she's
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
not here today irregardless he has been
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
here he has explained over and over I
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
think there's just
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
a a concern that's being brought on
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
behalf of those individuals that you're
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
hearing from ripson luno that the
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
process that is being done here that's
 
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
being established that Echoes statutory
 
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
law that we've had in place for years we
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
need to have this really put down in
 
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
place so we eliminate that confusion
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
that may be out there in terms of where
 
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
do I find the academic standards it's
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
not our task today to deal with those
 
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.990 align:start position:0%
not our task today to deal with those
academic

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
academic
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
standards those academic standards are
 
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
approved by the state
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
board and after we review and recommend
 
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
uh but we're not dealing with it we're
 
00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
just looking at process procedure right
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
now so I I would we don't have a flex a
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
shaky Foundation the commissioner has
 
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
been working with us on
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
this and has attended meetings and he
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
said I can't be there I will you and I
 
00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:41.559 align:start position:0%
sat down with him and we discussed this
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
and and quite frankly I think what you
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
see in front of you that I wrote down is
 
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
exactly where I stand right now um that
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
we have a a a a process going forward
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
where person can locate these academic
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
standards whether you believe the
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
academic standards up to Snuff that's
 
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
your individual perspective that's fine
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
change that's that's all I have on that
 
00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
on this part is there anything more on
 
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
the back
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
yes you want to do a five minute break
 
00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
break when
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
I met with Frank we had some areas that
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
we had discussed within the front half
 
00:55:49.359 --> 00:55:55.230 align:start position:0%
we had discussed within the front half
that

00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.240 --> 00:56:25.230 align:start position:0%
 
work

00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:55.230 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%

00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.119 --> 00:58:25.109 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:55.029 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.039 --> 00:59:25.029 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.039 --> 00:59:55.029 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.039 --> 01:00:24.950 align:start position:0%

01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to go ahead and jump from
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
the back half to the front
 
01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:09.799 align:start position:0%
half and address some of those issues
 
01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:12.039 align:start position:0%
which we had at the last meeting the
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
issues which I had a again as I said a
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
lengthy discussion with the commissioner
 
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.950 align:start position:0%
lengthy discussion with the commissioner
on

01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
Friday when we looked at 306.000
 
01:02:27.069 --> 01:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
2 in in the front half and we've gone
 
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
over this many
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
times um there were certain definitions
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
within that and item M within it the
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
definition of educator I understand
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
going correct me if I'm wrong that
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
there's now been a change where the
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
reference to
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
RSA 21-n col
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
8-d parentheses C has been added in
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
into uh the definition of
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
educator and that definition states that
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
it means a teacher or certified PA
 
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
professional then if you look down later
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
into the rules It also says that a
 
01:03:17.069 --> 01:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher has to be certified in
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
the area that they're teaching other
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
words they take their their elementary
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
teacher they're qualified to teach
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
elementary Ed it's not just going to be
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
somebody that has a degree
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
in physical education or the sciences
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
and taking the practices there they have
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
to take be qualified to teach an
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
elementary Ed so um if in fact the
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
reference to Ed um or excuse me RSA 21n
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
is in that definition I understand it is
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
then I'm good with that definition for
 
01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
educator further discussion on
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
that yes I I believe that that was uh as
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
you said a discussion at the earlier
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
meeting and that the um uh commissioner
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
had said that they would uh add that and
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
U if that's the case I am fine with it
 
01:04:07.079 --> 01:04:08.309 align:start position:0%
U if that's the case I am fine with it
as

01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
well is that the general consensus of
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
no no I I thought last week we had a
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
problem with defin definition of
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
educator because it included
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
instructional special par Educators
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
educational interpreter trans
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
literator School nurses and any other
 
01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.910 align:start position:0%
literator School nurses and any other
individuals

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
credentialed and are we not talking
 
01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
about that same one right
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about
 
01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
M yes no we're we're it's been I think
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
what they've done is reference
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
specifically to the RSA that I've talked
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
about Mr chair yes yeah um thanks do do
 
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
we have um final language on that to
 
01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
review and recommend or or or is this a
 
01:04:59.390 --> 01:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
you know you just said I think what
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
they've done is uh do do we have final
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
language of of what they're
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
changing um I'd have to look in the web
 
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm U you know I'm very um
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
cautious about making any sort of
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
provisional um acceptance of a of a
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
change without actually seeing the final
 
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
language Mr chair yes another question
 
01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:28.839 align:start position:0%
in regards to the purpose of this
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
committee we're just reviewing and
 
01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
making recommendations correct not
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
approving these that's right we're not
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
we're just reviewing and recommending
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
F going on down
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
then um to the next issue which we had
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
discussed and when the commissioner was
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
here when it came to educator he also
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
referenced another section I I've got to
 
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
find that right here to support the
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
there was the part that's spoke to
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
having to have be qualified for the area
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
packet is me
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
189 that one talking about and talking
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
about a a rule other rule see of another
 
01:07:49.359 --> 01:07:50.549 align:start position:0%
about a a rule other rule see of another
rule

01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
supports you know that this definition
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
of Ed it just further explains the
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
educator must have the
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
credential for that particular learning
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
instructed maybe what I'll do is do a
 
01:08:15.799 --> 01:08:22.390 align:start position:0%
instructed maybe what I'll do is do a
quick

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
call come back to that yeah let's let's
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
just let's keep going on we'll get some
 
01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
a response uh to you for that ref and
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
luno um the next one down which we had I
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
believe was 306.000
 
01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:39.550 align:start position:0%
believe was 306.000
2

01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
020 committee discussed def from
 
01:08:42.159 --> 01:08:44.349 align:start position:0%
020 committee discussed def from
Extended

01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
Extended
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
I you know when we talk about Extended
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
Learning I think the the the rule
 
01:09:06.799 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
Learning I think the the the rule
does

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:08.090 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:09.269 align:start position:0%
does
[Music]

01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
um I I'll just open up there any further
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
discussions on that that
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
component you're you're talking about on
 
01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
on the 602 um 02
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
I no oh sorry oh we get extending
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
running opportunities on page four oh
 
01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yes o o is the sorry the proposed
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
rule I is the existing rule yeah
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
um and you know we talked about adding
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
back the examples that were um that's
 
01:09:59.550 --> 01:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
right that were in I and U we also
 
01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
talked about how um how in the in the
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
definition of Extended Learning
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities in O that it talks about a
 
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
personalized learning process which
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
actually deviates from from current law
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the definition of of
 
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.950 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the definition of of
elos

01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
elos
 
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
and we also
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
discussed in in paragraph R under
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
instructional time uh keeping the
 
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
definition of instructional time that's
 
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
offered in
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
um oh Sor sorry I've moved on
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought it was part of the same
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
thing you know if I were to make a
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation as I'd recommend that the
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
that rule that we have there under
 
01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
o have reference in appendix one that's
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
where all our references
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
are I i' reference that back to where we
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
have the
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
definition or mentioned Extended
 
01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
Learning opportunities as mentioned as
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
in 193 col
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
one uh I I'd make a reference directly
 
01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.030 align:start position:0%
one uh I I'd make a reference directly
to

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
it uh that way it would
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
include those
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
areas that that those components of
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
Extended Learning are such as those
 
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.750 align:start position:0%
Extended Learning are such as those
those

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
areas Mr chair I would agree with that
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
um because if I recall correctly when um
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
the commissioner was here we brought
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
that we discussed that and we were going
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
to reference statue RSA 193 colon one 1
 
01:11:54.629 --> 01:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
H1 2 and 3 and that includes everything
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
that was would have been
 
01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.030 align:start position:0%
that was would have been
formerly

01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
formerly
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
in I of the old rules or the current
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
rules I should say yeah so in in in in
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
that statute it references 193 colon
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
1 1 H then parentheses
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
one these plans may include but are not
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
limited to such components or
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
combinations or of components of
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
Extended Learning opportunities
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
as and it goes en lists those areas so I
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
think what we can do there is just you
 
01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
know recommend that that reference
 
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.669 align:start position:0%
 
rules

01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
and yes or did uh put the reference
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
directly into o or I I just reference
 
01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
statute because that way you're not
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
changing right but yes reference that
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.149 --> 01:13:13.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so how would that how would that
 
01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
read Mr chair how would o
 
01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.709 align:start position:0%
read Mr chair how would o
read

01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.229 --> 01:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
um well I I I have to go back and get
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
here yeah it means a personalized
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
learning process allows for achievement
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
accomplishes through means of outside of
 
01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.750 align:start position:0%
accomplishes through means of outside of
the

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
classroom and pursuant to and I just put
 
01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.830 align:start position:0%
classroom and pursuant to and I just put
the

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.669 --> 01:13:50.679 align:start position:0%
RSA or or just even not even having to
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
change it there I would then reference
 
01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.990 align:start position:0%
change it there I would then reference
back

01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
rule you know
 
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
30602 parentheses o and I put in the
 
01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
pendex one the the reference that we
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
we're referring to the statutory
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
reference so so just to be clear when
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
when when a rule
 
01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
is is um is is backed up by a statuto
 
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.189 align:start position:0%
is is um is is backed up by a statuto
reference

01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
reference
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
that that statutory reference doesn't
 
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
become part of the rule the rule is
 
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
saying that that it's backed up by by
 
01:14:31.149 --> 01:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
that but in this case you want to you
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
want to reference the statuto the
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
statute in O uh because of the um the
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
the list of of you know including but
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
not limited to and the the various um
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
I think it accomplishes it either way uh
 
01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:02.679 align:start position:0%
by doing it this way you're you're not
 
01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
change anything you're just making a
 
01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
rule yeah I don't I don't think that's
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
as as complete does you know having it
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
um so why change it
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
yeah we we you can leave it just as is
 
01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.070 align:start position:0%
yeah we we you can leave it just as is
yeah

01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yeah I not make any reference
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
well leave it leave it as is the in the
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
current rules in the current rules yeah
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
no I meant leave it as it is leave it as
 
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
it is in the current rules if we're
 
01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
going to reference it
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
it Mr chair yes I believe when we had
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
the discussion when the commissioner was
 
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
here we were trying to make this um more
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
streamlined so in every situation where
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
instead of reiterating the statute we
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
were just going to reference the statute
 
01:16:29.709 --> 01:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
so that or we would recommending that
 
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
the statute be referenced um just to
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
rules I don't think making things
 
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
streamlined makes it easier for people
 
01:16:45.629 --> 01:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
to understand and find if they have to
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
go looking in an appendix to find out
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
what it really
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
says I they have it right in front of me
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
then have to go looking for it right but
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
if the statute changes then you also
 
01:16:59.470 --> 01:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
have to go back and change the rules
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
also yes so it's easier just to have the
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
point so on we're going to have to we
 
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
can go down here and approve things as
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
we go one way or the other um is
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
there because at the end of this I'd
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
like to make a you know have a show of
 
01:17:31.149 --> 01:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
hands in terms recommending this thing
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
as with X number changes or no changes
 
01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:37.159 align:start position:0%
or what to the as approved by the state
 
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
car

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
um H where where statute
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
or or reverting back to the way it
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
was I I would not like like to see it
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
reverting back to the way it was and I
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
think in terms of a recommendation um it
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
would be uh very general recommendation
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
and that the uh um definition of
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
ELO's um uh reference statutory language
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.910 align:start position:0%
in uh
1931

01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
1931
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
yeah in some way manner or form whether
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
it's directly in o or in the appendix um
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
I think just the fact that we're making
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
a ref a recommendation for reference to
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
statute is sufficient
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay okay is that a motion
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
yes second okay Senator Ward seconds
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
that um any further
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
discussion although just show a hands
 
01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
those people in supporting that those
 
01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.950 align:start position:0%
those people in supporting that those
opposed

01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay it's 4 to2 so we'll move forward
 
01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
with that reference to RSA 193 one
 
01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
Etc in the
 
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
appendix um going on to the next that we
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
had was 306.000 2 R I believe that was
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
time I fine with uh the
 
01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
rule so Mr chair yeah last week um um we
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
discussed and I think it was generally
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
um uh the the
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
the last week we discussed uh keeping
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
the existing uh definition of
 
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
instructional time from uh current
 
01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.149 align:start position:0%
instructional time from uh current
paragraph

01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
K because there is a
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
difference between during a time which
 
01:20:23.669 --> 01:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
instruction is offered versus a period
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
of time which pupil are actively working
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes but we also in that
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
conversation we're talking
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
about instructional time
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
varies from elementary to Middle to high
 
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
school um recess for example is
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
instructional time cor correct whereas
 
01:20:51.149 --> 01:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be at the middle school
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
right right and and I think we found
 
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
that in in statue
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
um if if my my memory serves me on that
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
but but um but there's there's a clear
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
definition a clear difference in meaning
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
when when you're talking about a period
 
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
of time where instruction is offered and
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
a period of time which pupils are
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
actively working towards achieving
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
educational outcomes those are two
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
different things one of them is is is
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
students making progress is student
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
centered the other one is not student
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
centered so so uh you know that this
 
01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
isn't this isn't just you know word
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
smithing um this
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
this this is a very significant change
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
um and one that U that impacts not just
 
01:21:49.629 --> 01:21:49.639 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph R and some you know rule
 
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
30602 but uh translates into every rule
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
um and everything that uh that schools
 
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
discussion okay let's let's take some
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
action on that uh who wants to put
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
something forward here oh okay yeah I'll
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
I'll move that we um we uh uh replace um
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph r with the language from
 
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
existing rule paragraph
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
K and that language being no
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
instructional time means the period of
 
01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
time during which pupils are actively
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
working toward achieving educational
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
objectives under the supervision of an
 
01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
educator or other staff member correct
 
01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.830 align:start position:0%
educator or other staff member correct
thank

01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
you is there a second I will okay we
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
have a motion to uh change the rule back
 
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
to the current rule as was just
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.310 --> 01:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
opposed okay that was T
 
01:23:05.229 --> 01:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
to four
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
so is there a subsequent motion yes
 
01:23:11.709 --> 01:23:11.719 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh yeah my motion is
 
01:23:11.719 --> 01:23:13.550 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh yeah my motion is
to

01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.070 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
uh support the recommendation of the uh
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
state board on um our instructional time
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
sir second second represent uh Pell
 
01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.550 align:start position:0%
sir second second represent uh Pell
seconds

01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
discussion all those in
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
opposed those opposed to Y
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay going on to the next one which we
 
01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:51.910 align:start position:0%
okay going on to the next one which we
had

01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
discussed and I believe this one right
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.679 --> 01:24:50.750 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.709 align:start position:0%
 
21

01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
21
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
did you find it no I'm looking for it
 
01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:43.430 align:start position:0%
did you find it no I'm looking for it
too

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.629 --> 01:25:45.639 align:start position:0%
I don't think there is
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
one is that a typo
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
errow no it's I think it's on page seven
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
what did that Dr
 
01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
us dual and concurrent enrollment in
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
no it's 3064 B
 
01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.870 align:start position:0%
no it's 3064 B
21

01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
21
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
no I know there's obviously a type
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment you see that under I think
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
I think I think the
 
01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
B is wrong I think it just goes down to
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
21 I think it's supposed to be a
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
parentheses a parentheses 21 and it's on
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
page 14 at least that's what I have
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
circled and then I've D how students can
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities could be yeah yeah there's
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that as it's done right
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
fine I had
 
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
added discussion language and we had and
 
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
we had decided at the last one to leave
 
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
it as is and I have a no in my
 
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
notes um I had dual and concurrent
 
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment college courses include and
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
then I had Early College High School
 
01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
Early College online and Early College
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
on college campus
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
enrollment

01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:53.310 --> 01:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
I I don't see any need for any changes
 
01:28:53.320 --> 01:29:07.950 align:start position:0%
I I don't see any need for any changes
there

01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
I I I hav no just leave it the way it is
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
M so anybody wants to change
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
that skip it
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:30.109 --> 01:29:30.119 align:start position:0%
this was the issue of kindergarten
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
12 yeah can we go back to page 15 page
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
15 yes culture and climate I I don't
 
01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
know if I'm being P it's say the school
 
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
board the school policies adopted by the
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
local school board shall reflect and it
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
changes to to the school board shall
 
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
that you're in the middle page 15 yeah
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
36.6 06 culture and climate
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it it's changing it from the ones
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
that they do telling them that they
 
01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:27.390 align:start position:0%
that they do telling them that they
shall

01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
address does so is is your is your
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
question uh whether there's a statutory
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
underpinning requiring a Schoolboard
 
01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
can we tell school boards that they must
 
01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.910 align:start position:0%
can we tell school boards that they must
adopt

01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.790 --> 01:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
them that they
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
must well current rules if you look at
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
3065 um the local school board shall
 
01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:52.550 align:start position:0%
3065 um the local school board shall
direct

01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
direct
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
see well there's a number of statutory
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
references to 306.000
 
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
6 and they're in the back of
 
01:32:18.109 --> 01:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh there's 190 189 1- C 189 colon 15
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
18974 19423 F 194 C4 2 Roman 2 C through
 
01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
appendix so I think I I think
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell's question is
 
01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
that is there a statutory reference
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
four

01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
one of the referenced
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
areas in the back in the appendant is
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
189 col 15 and I'm just looking at that
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
right now and it's titled
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
regulations the school board May un L
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%

01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
statute um um where we're directing how
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
school board's going to
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
function and right right right there are
 
01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
there are there are but there's also
 
01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
mandated policy welcome Barrett thank
 
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
you chairman lad good morning members of
 
01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
the committee Barett Christina from the
 
01:36:11.950 --> 01:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school boards Association
 
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
most of the policy requirements um at
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
least in rules are in 306.000 4 where it
 
01:36:20.669 --> 01:36:20.679 align:start position:0%
lists out a number I think there are
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
probably 25 or 26 policies that are
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
required in that provision of of the
 
01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:27.159 align:start position:0%
current minimum standards everything
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
from attendance and absenteeism to
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
bullying to homework to um how credit is
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
earned to hazing um a whole host of sort
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
of what I'll call partly behavioral
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
things bullying hazing um uh uh uh uh
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
attendance and absenteeism and then a
 
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
whole host of policies that are required
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
relative to what I'll call academics
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum homework how credit is earned
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
learned um uh uh Advanced coursework for
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
for a kid may be in eighth grade taking
 
01:37:01.629 --> 01:37:01.639 align:start position:0%
uh an advanced math class so that that
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
would count for credit when they get
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
into high school I think I mean I
 
01:37:07.390 --> 01:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
haven't counted recently there are
 
01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
probably if we were to look through the
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
minimum standards alone the current
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
version of the minimum standards there
 
01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
are probably between 30 and 40 policy
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
requirements within within that as well
 
01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
too and then we have a number of as I'm
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
sure this body knows we have a number of
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
policies uh School Board policies that
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
are required in statute some of those
 
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
are also included in rules some of them
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
are not um for example we know that the
 
01:37:35.709 --> 01:37:35.719 align:start position:0%
bullying statute requires school boards
 
01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
to have a policy that is incorporated by
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
reference in the minimum standards um
 
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
we've had some some bills the last
 
01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
couple of years about um I believe
 
01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
concussions and and injuries relative to
 
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
to student athletes that require school
 
01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
boards to adopt a policy I don't believe
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
those Have Made It by reference into any
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education rules the
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
public comment policy that was enacted
 
01:37:59.790 --> 01:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
two years ago I believe that is not part
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
of the minimum standards or any of the
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
rules I'm trying to think of what other
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
ones may have been um I don't think I
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
don't think the Manifest Ed um
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
provisions and RSA 1933 I could be
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
mistaken about that I don't think those
 
01:38:15.550 --> 01:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
are inquired are included by reference
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
in any of the any of the Department of
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
Education rules I could be wrong about
 
01:38:20.189 --> 01:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
that those might be the minimum
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
standards but so we've got a
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
if you will of both regulations
 
01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education regulations and
 
01:38:30.589 --> 01:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
statutes to say nothing of a federal law
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
that requires school boards have any
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
number of policies on any number of
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
topics some of those have made it into
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards or other
 
01:38:39.629 --> 01:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
department of education roles others
 
01:38:39.639 --> 01:38:44.629 align:start position:0%
department of education roles others
have

01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.589 --> 01:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
not and I'm happy to answer any
 
01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
questions very helpful thank you you
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
have a question represent your red okay
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:12.149 --> 01:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
so or several on the next page broad
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
statements that in terms of culture and
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
climate that school boards adopt
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
policies for um is there any objection
 
01:39:25.629 --> 01:39:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
okay let's march
 
01:39:31.629 --> 01:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
on um yeah you're talking about an
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
objection of 30606 yeah um well that's
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
the one that represent Cornell just
 
01:39:39.589 --> 01:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
brought up right right right yeah yeah I
 
01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
would I would I would suggest uh
 
01:39:44.589 --> 01:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
reverting back to the original uh the
 
01:39:44.599 --> 01:39:48.430 align:start position:0%
reverting back to the original uh the
current

01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
just going right rather than having the
 
01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:59.270 align:start position:0%
just going right rather than having the
policy

01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
mandate any policies adopted by the
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
board shall reflect and and you've got
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
the four yeah four points on
 
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
that I I would say leave it leave
 
01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:14.679 align:start position:0%
it go back to the existing back to the
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
original you want to make a motion yeah
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll um I'll move that um that that
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
30606 uh reverse back to the um the
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
existing rule
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
language I'll second it okay there's
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
motion the floor to revert back to the
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
current rule for 306.000
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
6 all those in
 
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
favor all those
 
01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
opposed okay it's two to
 
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
defeated I all moved in we support the
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh proposed
 
01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
3066 sir
 
01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
second okay we have a motion to support
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
the ed360 6 rule being presented by the
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
state board all those in favor I those
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
42 uh
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
30607 was an area where we had
 
01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:45.189 align:start position:0%
30607 was an area where we had
discussion

01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
of course there are rules for school
 
01:42:00.189 --> 01:42:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
too in Ru making in administrative
 
01:42:07.229 --> 01:42:07.239 align:start position:0%
rules especially when it comes to
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
that right right and I think M Mr chair
 
01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
I I I think if I recall the the
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
conversation we had the discussion we
 
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
had last week surrounding this is that
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
Ed 320 which the proposed rule
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh has as its only reference only has to
 
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
do with application for um for
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
um um Renovations or new new you know
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
new building design it doesn't it
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't it does not refer to existing um
 
01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
uh buildings it's
 
01:42:49.149 --> 01:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
only for um for new proposed uh changes
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
to buildings so you know given the fact
 
01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
that that most of our school buildings
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
are existing structures and um and will
 
01:43:03.149 --> 01:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
continue to be that way until such time
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
uh a um uh a school district approves of
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
Renovations or something like that in
 
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
conjunction with Ed 320 uh that school
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
boards still have to operate school
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
facilities uh According to some sort of
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
rule so so uh the existing 30607 7 talks
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
about what those facilities how those
 
01:43:29.589 --> 01:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
facilities shall be operated
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
including um clean healthy and safe
 
01:43:33.589 --> 01:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
learning environments lighting and
 
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
compliance with codes exhaust and
 
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
outdoor ventilation property temperature
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
humidity uh all these things that would
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
not apply to existing buildings if we
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
320 represent Celli yes but in in the
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
current rules
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
30607 um it's referring to statute so
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
all those things are currently in
 
01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
statute so I don't need I don't see the
 
01:44:08.589 --> 01:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
rules Mr chair yes
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
question it's referencing uh Ed 320 do
 
01:44:21.629 --> 01:44:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
320 yeah we can you they're right there
 
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
um and they they they do talk about
 
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:44.669 --> 01:44:44.679 align:start position:0%
Etc square footage all that for
 
01:44:47.229 --> 01:44:47.239 align:start position:0%
addresses the the three the 320s are
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
see would say that that pretty much
 
01:44:58.109 --> 01:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
covers what we need to
 
01:45:00.270 --> 01:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
consider yeah I think the reference of
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
320 really
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:25.149 --> 01:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
discussion so I I would I would support
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh just leaving the 306.97
 
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
board okay so we have a motion on the
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
table all those in favor of leaving just
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
as is as presented by the state board
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
one is 30608
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
MD the conversation we had is this
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
section directed towards
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
media library media centers or Does it
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
include all instruction curriculum
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
resources necessary to support learning
 
01:46:24.109 --> 01:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:25.870 --> 01:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh when I met with
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
the commissioner last week it's in
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
intended to reference all resources not
 
01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:40.790 align:start position:0%
intended to reference all resources not
just

01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
libraries and I think that's what he
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair yeah how does the um how
 
01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:01.719 align:start position:0%
does the existing rule then not also
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
apply to um all instructional resources
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
that being the first question the
 
01:47:11.589 --> 01:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
secondly do we then lose the um the
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
requirements uh as appropriate um for a
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
um for uh a library collection to be
 
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
cataloged and classified according to
 
01:47:21.599 --> 01:47:23.149 align:start position:0%
cataloged and classified according to
practices

01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:47:26.510 --> 01:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
Association or or or under the new Under
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules could
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
they have the collection organized any
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.589 --> 01:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
want well did you look at all the
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
references that this is referencing to
 
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.830 align:start position:0%
references that this is referencing to
and

01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
306.000 1891 it goes there's a whole ly
 
01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:59.310 align:start position:0%
306.000 1891 it goes there's a whole ly
of

01:47:59.310 --> 01:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
referencing the American Library
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
rules so if the Library Association as
 
01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
some organizations do
 
01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:47.239 align:start position:0%
change you
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
know what you know policies they have
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
are we automatically having to change
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
too I would say
 
01:48:56.239 --> 01:48:59.109 align:start position:0%
too I would say
yes

01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh I've been recently approached by a
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
group wanting us to automatically
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
approve school psychologist based upon a
 
01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
national National Association but what
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
happens if that National Association
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
changes do we have to also change our
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
certification requirements um there are
 
01:49:25.390 --> 01:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues when we reference
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
specific organizations or
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
associations should we not should we do
 
01:49:33.149 --> 01:49:33.159 align:start position:0%
it or should we not do it and that's one
 
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
of the major changes I see in
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
this represent cordelli uh yes I I know
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
when I look up um my local public
 
01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:45.310 align:start position:0%
when I look up um my local public
library

01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
library
 
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
online um to look for a book you know I
 
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
can search by Title by keyword by author
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
Etc I'm not looking
 
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
um based on a catalog of um food uh Das
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh stake uh Dash something or other um
 
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
that might have been in the old card
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
catalog I'm looking based on uh modern
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
search uh
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
technology um and I think the same holds
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
true in school
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
libraries Mr chair yes yeah I I I would
 
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
just put forth that I think that's a
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
very uninformed opinion
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
and that uh that you know we we don't
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
have any obviously uh expert testimony
 
01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
here from anybody that's a uh
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
credentialed um School librarian or
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
somebody with a master's degree in
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
library science that's trained in this
 
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
area but to imply that uh that our
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
public libraries and our school
 
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
libraries are still operating in uh in
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
the 1950s uh of card cataloges is I
 
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
think just endemic of somebody that
 
01:50:53.069 --> 01:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
probably hasn't walked into a library in
 
01:50:57.270 --> 01:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
a in a long time but uh but certainly um
 
01:50:59.709 --> 01:50:59.719 align:start position:0%
certainly you know
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
Library organization and
 
01:51:06.149 --> 01:51:06.159 align:start position:0%
cataloging um standards have uh have
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
evolved and continue to evolve and um
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
and compliance with those sorts of
 
01:51:14.069 --> 01:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
standards for um for collections and
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
school libraries I I think probably have
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
done our students um well in terms of
 
01:51:22.589 --> 01:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
their ability to to search primary
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
references both in the school library
 
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
and in public libraries across the
 
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
country um and um and to uh to take it
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
out and and let it
 
01:51:39.069 --> 01:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
be sort of random um it does a diservice
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
to um to our kids and I i' I'd be very
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
cautious about about um removing that
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
existing language thank
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
you yeah I wasn't trying to imply that
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
any public library any school library is
 
01:51:59.390 --> 01:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
um back in the
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
1950s um they're not they're in uh uh
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
current they're using current technology
 
01:52:11.149 --> 01:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh to help people find
 
01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
materials and I think that um the need
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
for uh the current a to be carried
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
forward in the new rules is uh
 
01:52:26.589 --> 01:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
dating back to the
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
50s I'd like to add on that if you look
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
at the last item within this section
 
01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:34.149 align:start position:0%
at the last item within this section
item

01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
item
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
D the and it's speaking to the school
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
board responsibilities implements a plan
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
approved by the District administration
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
for ongoing development organization
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
acquisition maintenance replacement and
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
updating of curriculum and learning
 
01:52:50.069 --> 01:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
resources necessary to support the needs
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
of students so I think this is fut F
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
istic looking at you know they're
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
looking at you we have to be current
 
01:52:59.790 --> 01:52:59.800 align:start position:0%
with our resources that we're using
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
um and without getting down into the
 
01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
weeds and mandating that you do a per
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
use a particular
 
01:53:09.599 --> 01:53:12.790 align:start position:0%
use a particular
system

01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:14.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:19.069 --> 01:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
so there again I I I think this
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh and and if we see a need to change
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
policy then we can recommend policy
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
changes through legislation but I think
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of rules right here I think
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
they are supportive of the current
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
statutes and there's no reason to say to
 
01:53:40.109 --> 01:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
object to uh what is being proposed by
 
01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
board so is there a motion so move okay
 
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
Senator board made a motion to approve I
 
01:53:58.669 --> 01:53:58.679 align:start position:0%
I believe you're approved or to
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
recommend the State Board recommendation
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
on D yes yes on on on D on the whole
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
thing on the whole section yes the was
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
it the one well I just read that one
 
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
section to support what they're doing on
 
01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:15.709 align:start position:0%
section to support what they're doing on
the

01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
entire area which we're referencing
 
01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
there in
 
01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
306.000 N D is is one we had discussed
 
01:54:27.629 --> 01:54:27.639 align:start position:0%
yes is there a second to recommending
 
01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
support for what's being uh presented by
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
the State Board second okay we have a
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
motion made by Senator Ward and second
 
01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0%
by representative cordelli to approve or
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
to support I guess to is it support or
 
01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
approved because we don't do we review
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
and recommend yeah recommend support
 
01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
support of the State Board
 
01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
30608 all those in favor I I okay for
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
all those post
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
two that takes us through the items
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
which we
 
01:55:11.069 --> 01:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
so like to go ahead then and
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh if there's any further discussion or
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation represent cordelli
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
yes I would uh recommend
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
support for the uh proposed Ed
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
306 uh
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
rules with uh any
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations um made by uh this uh
 
01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:46.470 align:start position:0%
recommendations um made by uh this uh
oversight

01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
committee Mr chair is there is there a
 
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
second second okay so there's a motion
 
01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
on the floor made by representa cordelli
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
and second by Senator
 
01:56:02.669 --> 01:56:02.679 align:start position:0%
Ward yeah thank you very much Mr chair I
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
believe we also talked last week about
 
01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:09.639 align:start position:0%
proposed rule 306 uh rule 14 which is
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
also in the front
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
side yeah we did and so are we um are we
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
going to have some conversation about
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
that yeah we should have some
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
do you want to I'll motion and
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
I'll okay so we are back to no motion on
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
the table uh
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
30614 deals with
 
01:56:42.109 --> 01:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh student teacher ratios so let's move
 
01:56:42.119 --> 01:56:46.750 align:start position:0%
uh student teacher ratios so let's move
to

01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:52.510 --> 01:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
that and so um so Mr chair my my
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
understanding would be
 
01:56:59.629 --> 01:56:59.639 align:start position:0%
since we met last week that
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
the that the proposed definition of new
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
def that there's a proposed change to
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.709 --> 01:57:11.719 align:start position:0%
educator that is referenced in this
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
proposed rule is that correct that's
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's our understanding and that's
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
would be our recommendation that it be
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
pursuant to that that RSA we put at the
 
01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
very beginning 21 and right and and and
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
I had back when we were discussing that
 
01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
I had requested that we be able to look
 
01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
at final language um on that before
 
01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
um before moving forward with it because
 
01:57:42.669 --> 01:57:42.679 align:start position:0%
um because I think the the I think the
 
01:57:45.550 --> 01:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
final language is is going to be very
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
important and um and and I think last
 
01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.310 align:start position:0%
important and um and and I think last
week's

01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
week's
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
discussion or maybe it was
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh two weeks ago's discussion when the
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner was
 
01:58:03.149 --> 01:58:03.159 align:start position:0%
here talked about how there would be a
 
01:58:07.229 --> 01:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
some sort of additional restriction of
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
being able or not restriction but
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
additional um
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
um uh what's the word I'm looking for
 
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
here um
 
01:58:22.109 --> 01:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
um I I guess limitation on on on the Ed
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
Educators that would be used in the
 
01:58:26.189 --> 01:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
calculation of the ratio that they would
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
have to be certified or sorry
 
01:58:32.189 --> 01:58:32.199 align:start position:0%
credentialed in the um academic area
 
01:58:35.069 --> 01:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
being taught whether that was Elementary
 
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
or you know math at in middle school or
 
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
something like that and um and that we'd
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
only and that the department would only
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
use uh would only consider Educators
 
01:58:50.109 --> 01:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
that that met that content area um
 
01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
condition and but doesn't say that in
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
the rule well to respond to that it does
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
but not in that rule it goes back to
 
01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:03.709 align:start position:0%
but not in that rule it goes back to
30612

01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
30612
 
01:59:06.189 --> 01:59:06.199 align:start position:0%
A3 where the hiring and training of
 
01:59:08.589 --> 01:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
Educators license under ed500 to
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
facilitate learning in their credential
 
01:59:11.159 --> 01:59:13.430 align:start position:0%
facilitate learning in their credential
content

01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
content
 
01:59:15.629 --> 01:59:15.639 align:start position:0%
area um
 
01:59:18.510 --> 01:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
so and we we're talking educator and
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
earlier we're saying Educators have to
 
01:59:22.589 --> 01:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
be certified
 
01:59:23.709 --> 01:59:23.719 align:start position:0%
according to
 
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
21n colon 8 I believe it was and and and
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
I asked the same question again to the
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner on Friday and he referenced
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
back to this section in
 
01:59:41.229 --> 01:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
30612 where it's requiring that they be
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
in their content areas and that's where
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
they're certified in so a classroom
 
01:59:49.629 --> 01:59:49.639 align:start position:0%
teacher in a grade school is going to be
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
Elementary certified
 
01:59:53.709 --> 01:59:53.719 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
department so that's how I see that
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
connection okay so what's what what was
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
that what was the rule reference on that
 
02:00:05.550 --> 02:00:05.560 align:start position:0%
uh back to well we were we're talking
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
about 30614 educator ratios right right
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
but but then that references back to Ed
 
02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:16.950 align:start position:0%
but but then that references back to Ed
30612

02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
it and see there's under that there's a
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
and there's item two and item three so
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
current rule
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
15 new rule is 12 current rule is 15
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
professional staff and staff
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications I'm looking at the new
 
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
24 so so so uh the proposed rule 30612
 
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
references the proposed Rule
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
30614 and it does so under on page 24 on
 
02:02:25.390 --> 02:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
the side by side in um in A4 the number
 
02:02:28.030 --> 02:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
of Educators sufficient to satisfy the
 
02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.589 --> 02:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.790 --> 02:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:03.310 --> 02:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
so these are ratios not class size so so
 
02:03:12.750 --> 02:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:19.149 align:start position:0%
 
school

02:03:19.149 --> 02:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
right or in a or or in in a in a Grade
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
range you're you're talking about class
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
size too when you're like in
 
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
kindergarten well it's talking about
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
ratios to it's not talking about it's
 
02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
titled student ratios yes student
 
02:03:37.229 --> 02:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
educator ratio
 
02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
right but then it's also covered by that
 
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
0.12 rule where the
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
Area 25 students or fewer per
 
02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:57.719 align:start position:0%
educator so I I would I would agree that
 
02:04:00.629 --> 02:04:00.639 align:start position:0%
in 141 where it talks about
 
02:04:03.549 --> 02:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
kindergarten 25 students or fewer per
 
02:04:06.910 --> 02:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
educator that it's talking about
 
02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:08.990 align:start position:0%
educator that it's talking about
Educators

02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
Educators
 
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the final language of
 
02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
that of that definition so I'm only I
 
02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
don't recall where that landed the
 
02:04:30.990 --> 02:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
educator it was something it it it
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
rolled in that the
 
02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:34.870 align:start position:0%
rolled in that the
21n

02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
21n
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
8 D DC right teacher or certified Pro
 
02:04:41.950 --> 02:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
par professional something like that as
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
right or or I'd have to go back and look
 
02:04:58.870 --> 02:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:01.069 --> 02:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
means a teacher or certified PA of
 
02:05:01.079 --> 02:05:07.669 align:start position:0%
means a teacher or certified PA of
professional

02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
young but see a certified par
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
professional to the best of my
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
understanding would not be the teacher
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
of a grade one
 
02:05:19.950 --> 02:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
classroom so so let's let's um let's
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
pick Middle School just for or or high
 
02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
school for example where where you've
 
02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:26.629 align:start position:0%
school for example where where you've
got

02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
got
 
02:05:33.629 --> 02:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
educator is is would that would the
 
02:05:36.199 --> 02:05:38.069 align:start position:0%
educator is is would that would the
librarian

02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
librarian
 
02:05:40.990 --> 02:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
be used in the calculation of student
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
teacher ratio
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay so high school for n you know
 
02:05:54.549 --> 02:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
and would it would it be done
 
02:06:00.910 --> 02:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
by for the entire School 9 through 12
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
and it would include everybody to finded
 
02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
in an educator that's certified to be op
 
02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
be practicing professionally in that
 
02:06:08.669 --> 02:06:08.679 align:start position:0%
High School including the building
 
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
principal including the the um school
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
counselor including the librarian
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
including the um the the teachers and
 
02:06:21.149 --> 02:06:21.159 align:start position:0%
all subject matters uh uh divided into
 
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
the number students in grades 9 through
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
12 would How would how would that ratio
 
02:06:26.639 --> 02:06:28.709 align:start position:0%
12 would How would how would that ratio
be

02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
calculated educator um pertains to
 
02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
yeah so be your music teacher your PE
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
teacher took the practice and certified
 
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:04.589 align:start position:0%
 
high

02:07:04.589 --> 02:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
school so then so then at at the high
 
02:07:09.870 --> 02:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
school where we I'm on page 28 on the
 
02:07:13.310 --> 02:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
side by side proposed rules in paragraph
 
02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
three Middle School and High School 30
 
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
students or fewer per educator uh is
 
02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
that per per classroom
 
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
or is it per content area so if there
 
02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
um uh 90 students and
 
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
three teachers or or I I don't know how
 
02:07:42.430 --> 02:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
to calculate it
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
um 90 students taking
 
02:07:45.679 --> 02:07:49.109 align:start position:0%
um 90 students taking
Civics

02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:52.589 --> 02:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
and one teacher
 
02:07:55.589 --> 02:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
qualified certified to teach Civics is
 
02:08:01.709 --> 02:08:01.719 align:start position:0%
that a 90 to one or is it a 30 to one if
 
02:08:05.910 --> 02:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:08.149 --> 02:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
sections or if they're teaching five
 
02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
one teachers can teach outside their
 
02:08:17.199 --> 02:08:18.750 align:start position:0%
one teachers can teach outside their
content

02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
content
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
area what is it 50% no but I'm just just
 
02:08:23.870 --> 02:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
going with what you're talking about Mr
 
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
chair the the the certified to teach in
 
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
a Content area because I think that's
 
02:08:32.669 --> 02:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
the that's the the the condition that
 
02:08:34.589 --> 02:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
that you have said is going to be
 
02:08:37.149 --> 02:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
applied to this Rule and I I think we
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
heard the commissioner um talk about
 
02:08:41.149 --> 02:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
that condition I used that when I'm
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
speaking to the elementary teacher but
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
when in a high school you may have
 
02:08:47.069 --> 02:08:47.079 align:start position:0%
somebody has a wonderful background and
 
02:08:49.950 --> 02:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
something but they're certified in
 
02:08:52.189 --> 02:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
mathematics but they're teaching a
 
02:08:52.199 --> 02:08:53.830 align:start position:0%
mathematics but they're teaching a
language

02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
class that's
 
02:08:58.229 --> 02:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
acceptable if the majority of their
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
times in their content area map no no I
 
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
I get that I get that too um I'm just
 
02:09:07.069 --> 02:09:07.079 align:start position:0%
wondering how the calculation going to
 
02:09:09.669 --> 02:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
be done because it doesn't talk about
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
these conditions of being certified in
 
02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
an area um number of students taking
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
classes in that area and maybe you've
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
got the math teacher teaching a couple
 
02:09:21.119 --> 02:09:21.870 align:start position:0%
got the math teacher teaching a couple
SE

02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
SE
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:32.189 --> 02:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
civics and and now it's okay to include
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
in the calculation an educator who's not
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
credentialed in that instructional
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
area and and none of this is spelled out
 
02:09:45.549 --> 02:09:45.559 align:start position:0%
in rules well if you go back to
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
83612 it talks about the number of
 
02:09:50.669 --> 02:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
educator Educators sufficient to satisfy
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
the student educated ratios in
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
um I think this allows
 
02:10:07.870 --> 02:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
that you know we're not really I don't
 
02:10:10.589 --> 02:10:10.599 align:start position:0%
see how we're really changing this from
 
02:10:14.189 --> 02:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
what we currently have no no but but I
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
but Mr chair because it's a rule
 
02:10:20.350 --> 02:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it be clear on how how these
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
ratios are Cal calculated do we are we
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
really just leaving it up to the
 
02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
building principal or the superintendent
 
02:10:32.830 --> 02:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
or the school board to calculate it any
 
02:10:38.709 --> 02:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
way they want um and and I'm I'm not so
 
02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
I I mean I think you're right when
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
you're when when we talk about
 
02:10:44.830 --> 02:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and Elementary kindergarten
 
02:10:47.709 --> 02:10:47.719 align:start position:0%
two and then Elementary grades 3 to 5 3
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
to 5 I don't I don't I don't know if if
 
02:10:53.189 --> 02:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
those are if they're content area
 
02:10:55.229 --> 02:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
certification at those grade levels or
 
02:10:57.229 --> 02:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
if you're just talking Elementary
 
02:11:00.030 --> 02:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
certification I I don't know the answer
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
to that but at the high school level
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
Middle School and High School level I
 
02:11:06.069 --> 02:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
think you're talking content area
 
02:11:08.669 --> 02:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
certifications and and now you've got
 
02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
other professionals that are that are
 
02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
also included in the definition of
 
02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
educator and are they going to be used
 
02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
in as part of this calculation is that
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
condition are there going to be any
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
conditions that apply to um uh to this
 
02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
rule cuz it's just not it's just not
 
02:11:27.310 --> 02:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
spelled out
 
02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:30.559 align:start position:0%
and and I think this is and it's an area
 
02:11:32.589 --> 02:11:32.599 align:start position:0%
that I think has had a lot of concern
 
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
public um looking at page 28 side bys
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
side um uh
 
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
three uh middle school and Senior High
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
Schools 30 students or fewer per
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
educator is the same in the current as
 
02:11:52.350 --> 02:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
well as the proposed
 
02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
um and we know via was it
 
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
30612 um that we're dealing with an
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
educator um in that content area so I
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
don't see how um we're going to mix in a
 
02:12:11.950 --> 02:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
um a music educator in a figuring out
 
02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
the ratio for a math class so so just to
 
02:12:18.510 --> 02:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
respond to that Mr chair I think that's
 
02:12:20.709 --> 02:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
I think that's an easy response on that
 
02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
and that in calculating class size you
 
02:12:26.430 --> 02:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
know exactly who the educators are in
 
02:12:30.430 --> 02:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
that in that class and uh whether it's a
 
02:12:34.069 --> 02:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh let's go back to the Civics um um
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
class example whether it's a a teacher
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's certified to teach in civics or
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
somebody that's certified to teach math
 
02:12:44.270 --> 02:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's picking up one section of civics
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
and and obviously and the principal you
 
02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
know feels feels good about that that
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
person's ability to uh to teach that
 
02:12:56.790 --> 02:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
section that that that in that class you
 
02:12:58.589 --> 02:12:58.599 align:start position:0%
in that class because it's a class-size
 
02:13:01.709 --> 02:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
calculation not a ratio calculation in
 
02:13:08.069 --> 02:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
that class uh you've got one teacher and
 
02:13:11.549 --> 02:13:11.559 align:start position:0%
up to 30 students that would be the um
 
02:13:13.950 --> 02:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
that would be the hard you know limit
 
02:13:16.990 --> 02:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
based on the current current Rule and um
 
02:13:20.549 --> 02:13:20.559 align:start position:0%
and now in the the ratio rule uh we're
 
02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
not talking about about a class
 
02:13:25.709 --> 02:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
anymore they're talking about multiple
 
02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
sections of a Content area maybe maybe
 
02:13:32.109 --> 02:13:32.119 align:start position:0%
you're talking the entire middle school
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:39.430 --> 02:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
maybe and and as as you said Mr chair
 
02:13:43.109 --> 02:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
the the um the the
 
02:13:45.629 --> 02:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
librarian and I guess the principle and
 
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
the school counselor could be considered
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
in that
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
calculation did you said the librarian
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
would be yeah it's it we're talking
 
02:13:56.990 --> 02:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
about a situation go down to the grade
 
02:13:58.430 --> 02:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
schools again where you have a classroom
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
teacher for grade three or two but you
 
02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
also have coming in throughout that week
 
02:14:06.910 --> 02:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
one fifth of that time is probably going
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
to be made up of a music teacher
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
librarian uh art physical education so
 
02:14:16.589 --> 02:14:16.599 align:start position:0%
the prep periods right negotiated
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
agreement so but you're still going to
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to have a ratio in that regular
 
02:14:27.310 --> 02:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
classroom with taking the extras out but
 
02:14:28.629 --> 02:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
you're also going to have to have those
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
extras hired on board so your your
 
02:14:36.549 --> 02:14:36.559 align:start position:0%
ratios you you're going to be in for the
 
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
classroom you're going to have to make
 
02:14:43.229 --> 02:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
sure that that ratio is 25 to1 in grade
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
two but you're going to require
 
02:14:48.669 --> 02:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
additional staff to get all your content
 
02:14:51.229 --> 02:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
subjects taught so you're going to add
 
02:14:54.629 --> 02:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
more certified teachers into that
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
mix so so M Mr chair I I I I agree with
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
with that as an as an approach to to to
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
limit class size but that's not what the
 
02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
rule says the rule the proposed rule
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
does not talk about classroom doesn't
 
02:15:15.790 --> 02:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
use the word classroom anywhere well it
 
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
does in in the in the kindergarten grade
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
3 through 5 it says class size of 25
 
02:15:27.149 --> 02:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
class size of 20 no no that's a that's
 
02:15:29.229 --> 02:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
aspirational shall strive to achieve a
 
02:15:31.709 --> 02:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
class size of 20 students yeah but the
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
rule is 25 students are fewer per
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
educator and and I great I I do agree
 
02:15:40.830 --> 02:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
with you that kindergarten through
 
02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
grades two and and I guess to the extent
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
grades three to five where where
 
02:15:51.629 --> 02:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
educators are certified in Elementary or
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
early childhood you know education
 
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's a little bit easier to um
 
02:16:00.669 --> 02:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
to um come up with the uh the total in
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
the denominator but in high school and
 
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
and that that there's there's no such
 
02:16:15.149 --> 02:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:17.589 --> 02:16:17.599 align:start position:0%
definition Middle School and High School
 
02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
30 students or fewer per educator and so
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
so that's a ratio and so so you know
 
02:16:27.950 --> 02:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
hooping in Middle High School has has I
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
don't know um um 450 kids in it and and
 
02:16:36.669 --> 02:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
you've got um you've
 
02:16:40.629 --> 02:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
got you know so many teachers and that's
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
the ratio because that's what it says in
 
02:16:43.519 --> 02:16:45.190 align:start position:0%
the ratio because that's what it says in
the

02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
rule represent Cordell but is there any
 
02:16:50.589 --> 02:16:50.599 align:start position:0%
change from the current the current does
 
02:16:50.599 --> 02:16:51.389 align:start position:0%
change from the current the current does
not

02:16:51.389 --> 02:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
say class size as had been um and is in
 
02:17:01.629 --> 02:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
the uh uh lower grades no no the the the
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
current rule specifically is class size
 
02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
not for middle school and high school it
 
02:17:07.790 --> 02:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely is because it's it begins
 
02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
a and it has paragraphs 1 two and three
 
02:17:18.549 --> 02:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
under paragraph a so a is class size for
 
02:17:20.910 --> 02:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
instructional purposes in each School
 
02:17:24.429 --> 02:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
shall be and gu kindergarten through 2
 
02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
25 grades 3 through 5 30 and middle
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
school and high school
 
02:17:49.389 --> 02:17:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
size well then in the current rule how
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
do you justify then that shall be versus
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
in um one and two for those lower grades
 
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
strive to achieve the class size so is
 
02:18:06.349 --> 02:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
it so is it shall be or strive to
 
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
achieve so you've got that in the
 
02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
current rules so kindergarten through
 
02:18:14.709 --> 02:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
grade two 25 um or fewer per 25 students
 
02:18:17.549 --> 02:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
or few are per educator so that's that's
 
02:18:19.309 --> 02:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
the class siiz
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
ceiling um and provided that each School
 
02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:23.429 align:start position:0%
ceiling um and provided that each School
sh

02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
sh
 
02:18:26.549 --> 02:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
shall you know strive to achieve a class
 
02:18:29.309 --> 02:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
size of 20 or fewer per educator and I
 
02:18:32.429 --> 02:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
think that's where where Miss Wilson um
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
discussed with us uh last week that uh
 
02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:37.519 align:start position:0%
that from a budgeting purpose that's a
 
02:18:39.549 --> 02:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
good place to start because you don't
 
02:18:41.389 --> 02:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
know who's going to be moving in moving
 
02:18:43.230 --> 02:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
out what your final you know enrollment
 
02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be and that provides it
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
provides a little bit of breathing room
 
02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
between um you if you've got you know
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
four sections of um of Le let's say you
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
know third grade then you'd have if you
 
02:19:01.309 --> 02:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
were budgeting for 20 per classroom um
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
four sections you could have 20 kids
 
02:19:08.190 --> 02:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
move in and you'd be at 25 per classroom
 
02:19:10.110 --> 02:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
you'd be at that ceiling but you you
 
02:19:12.509 --> 02:19:12.519 align:start position:0%
started with a good budget uh budget
 
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
amount and I think that's why that
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
language likely exists and I think
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's what what Miss Wilson um
 
02:19:24.030 --> 02:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
explained to us yesterday or last week
 
02:19:26.589 --> 02:19:26.599 align:start position:0%
um but don't you need that same
 
02:19:28.830 --> 02:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility at middle school and high
 
02:19:30.349 --> 02:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
school also yeah and you've well you've
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
got it in in at grades three through
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
five and then at the high school um you
 
02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a you don't have an
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
aspirational in in either but you have
 
02:19:41.599 --> 02:19:43.669 align:start position:0%
aspirational in in either but you have
some

02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:19:45.790 --> 02:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
exceptions well I'm just saying for
 
02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
larger classes you know um and that's
 
02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
for your study halls no study halls band
 
02:19:53.790 --> 02:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
and chorus you've got that and and and
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
those those are um those are true is is
 
02:20:02.309 --> 02:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
well in in the current rule it's it's by
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
class size in in in the proposed rule
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
so um but in the current
 
02:20:23.190 --> 02:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
a class size and each School shall be
 
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
and you flip over to three Middle School
 
02:20:28.750 --> 02:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
and High middle and Senior High School
 
02:20:34.590 --> 02:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:37.630 --> 02:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
be in the current law as the way I read
 
02:20:42.510 --> 02:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
it and so with the proposed rule you're
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
adding that
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility so that um it based on
 
02:20:50.830 --> 02:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
students moving in and out um you're
 
02:20:53.790 --> 02:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
providing that flexibility that you're
 
02:20:56.950 --> 02:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh achieving or you're striving for in
 
02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
the lower
 
02:21:02.790 --> 02:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
grades I'm I'm I'm failing to to see the
 
02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
point because it under the current rule
 
02:21:08.110 --> 02:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
for high school class size for
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
instructional purpose in each School
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
shall be I'm just going to go right to
 
02:21:13.950 --> 02:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
the high school middle and Senior High
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
School 30 students or fewer per educator
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
that's class size that's what it says 30
 
02:21:23.590 --> 02:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
students are fewer no there's no strive
 
02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
to achieve that class
 
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
size um you could you could you could
 
02:21:32.190 --> 02:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
certainly I mean strive to achieve is
 
02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
sort of a I mean that's that's not a
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that's an aspirational thing
 
02:21:41.070 --> 02:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
and I and I and I'm sure um having been
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
on you know Schoolboard for a dozen
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
years that that um when when when doing
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
schedules and looking at you your April
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
15 um renewal dates and all of that type
 
02:21:54.990 --> 02:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
of stuff that you've you've got a
 
02:21:56.910 --> 02:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
general idea what sort of program you're
 
02:21:58.190 --> 02:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
going to be offering and what sort of
 
02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
class size you're going to be um you're
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
going to be uh you know experiencing and
 
02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:06.030 align:start position:0%
going to be uh you know experiencing and
um

02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
and you know and and you know it's not
 
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
saying that it's not saying in the
 
02:22:12.830 --> 02:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
current rules that class sizes have to
 
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
be 30 students per educator saying 30 or
 
02:22:18.270 --> 02:22:18.280 align:start position:0%
30 students are fewer per educator so
 
02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
you could certainly strive for 25 or
 
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
drive for 20 um whatever your um you
 
02:22:26.830 --> 02:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
know school board and and voters uh you
 
02:22:28.670 --> 02:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
know accept during that whole budget
 
02:22:34.750 --> 02:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
time represent
 
02:22:44.190 --> 02:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
pel I think that the rule change in 3061
 
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
14a gives a lot of latitude to the
 
02:22:49.550 --> 02:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
school board to determine the classroom
 
02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:50.950 align:start position:0%
school board to determine the classroom
sizes

02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
sizes
 
02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:53.469 align:start position:0%
sizes
I

02:22:53.469 --> 02:22:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
mean establish student educator ratios
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
that promote student learning for each
 
02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
learning opportunity and learning based
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
upon school safety policies content
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
instructional method the characteristics
 
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
of Learners and the following these are
 
02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
just number
 
02:23:13.070 --> 02:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines um but gives them a lot of
 
02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
ability to move based on students moving
 
02:23:17.230 --> 02:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
in moving out different learning styles
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
I mean these rules have to last for 10
 
02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
years unless
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
there's another change in statute
 
02:23:37.750 --> 02:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:41.070 --> 02:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
sizes you know there's differing demands
 
02:23:44.110 --> 02:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
too in these high schools are you going
 
02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
to have the same number of kids in your
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
general math class as you are in an AP
 
02:23:51.230 --> 02:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
class I don't know but many smaller
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
districts the AP class is going to have
 
02:23:55.309 --> 02:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
a few students and it's
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
hard to staff these based upon our
 
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
funding formula but um
 
02:24:05.590 --> 02:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's I think we need as representative
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
peros that flexibility for the school
 
02:24:10.590 --> 02:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
board to make these decisions and and to
 
02:24:12.429 --> 02:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
prioritize and I think that's what the
 
02:24:16.269 --> 02:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
new statutory language is trying to
 
02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
do so so thank thank you for for that Mr
 
02:24:24.190 --> 02:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
chair um I when when you talk about
 
02:24:26.670 --> 02:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility you're I I hope we're
 
02:24:31.910 --> 02:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
talking about flexibility to uh to to um
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
provide the right um level of
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
educational services to uh to students
 
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
and um and you know the I I think with
 
02:24:45.389 --> 02:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
ratios I think with class size it's very
 
02:24:47.230 --> 02:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
clear very clear and I think the level
 
02:24:49.389 --> 02:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
of flexibility is certainly there in the
 
02:24:53.469 --> 02:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
existing rule um um I have no problem
 
02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
moving over the um you know some of the
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
U the language from new paragraph a that
 
02:25:03.269 --> 02:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh promotes learning and and and you
 
02:25:05.150 --> 02:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
know based on safety policies content
 
02:25:06.910 --> 02:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
structure methods I think that's all
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
good good stuff and and probably should
 
02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
be in the uh the existing rule but um I
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
think the level of flexibility that's
 
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
being afforded here um afforded school
 
02:25:18.429 --> 02:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
boards and superintendents and building
 
02:25:21.030 --> 02:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
principles here is to is to look at
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
class or look at sort of sorry student
 
02:25:28.990 --> 02:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
um uh student teacher ratios across uh
 
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
an entire School building across an
 
02:25:33.950 --> 02:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
entire grade range an entire um um
 
02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
subject um matter and um and and be able
 
02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
to see widely varying uh class sizes as
 
02:25:44.429 --> 02:25:44.439 align:start position:0%
opposed to class sizes with a with um
 
02:25:48.429 --> 02:25:48.439 align:start position:0%
with a hard ceiling that um
 
02:25:52.110 --> 02:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
um as we have in in the existing uh
 
02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
rules and I think there there was
 
02:25:56.910 --> 02:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
probably I I don't have a breakdown of
 
02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
the of the comments the the public
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
comments that came back on the usuals
 
02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
but this is clearly a lightning rod area
 
02:26:04.950 --> 02:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
where um where I think families across
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
the state um uh don't want to see um um
 
02:26:14.590 --> 02:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
certain classes balloon in terms of uh
 
02:26:16.830 --> 02:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh class size just because the
 
02:26:18.510 --> 02:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
student teacher ratio across the whole
 
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:29.469 --> 02:26:29.479 align:start position:0%
this is a huge huge issue and it even
 
02:26:32.990 --> 02:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
gets into funding side of the coin and
 
02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
where we talk about the original input
 
02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
formula based on student teacher
 
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
ratios um
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's yeah it comes down to the local
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
board making those CH decisions and to
 
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
the town legislature whether they're
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
going to support the dollars to to
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
enable you to do some of the things
 
02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to but I don't think
 
02:26:56.510 --> 02:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
that the rules here are curtailing that
 
02:26:59.230 --> 02:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
from happening I think there're B
 
02:27:00.630 --> 02:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
basically I think
 
02:27:03.469 --> 02:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
they're the same as basically what we
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
have right now no they're they're
 
02:27:07.630 --> 02:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
removing the guard rails that are in
 
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:15.670 align:start position:0%
 
doing

02:27:15.670 --> 02:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay is there any further
 
02:27:22.990 --> 02:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
is there a recommendation or a
 
02:27:29.309 --> 02:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
motion yes represent cordelli uh yes
 
02:27:32.110 --> 02:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation to support the uh
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
proposed um
 
02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:38.630 align:start position:0%
proposed um
30614

02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
rule with the understanding that that
 
02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
first definition of educator changes to
 
02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
reflect the
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
statute right we we already made that
 
02:27:51.790 --> 02:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation of yeah but to to ensure
 
02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
02:27:55.630 --> 02:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
occurring um okay okay I think that's
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's all tying together here okay okay
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
is there a second on that second okay
 
02:28:03.790 --> 02:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
the motion made by represent cordelli
 
02:28:11.790 --> 02:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:15.950 --> 02:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
30614 rule recommend recommendation of
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
the State Board contingent upon the
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
definition of educator also
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
incorporating the RSA reference to the
 
02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
educator any further
 
02:28:36.510 --> 02:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
discussion sure yes yeah just we we also
 
02:28:39.550 --> 02:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the um um final language
 
02:28:41.870 --> 02:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
for the defition definition of educator
 
02:28:44.469 --> 02:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
so so this is this is all based on
 
02:28:47.070 --> 02:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
provisional um whatever well it's based
 
02:28:49.710 --> 02:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
on this this this action right here in
 
02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
front of would be contingent
 
02:28:56.429 --> 02:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
upon the def the educator referencing
 
02:28:58.590 --> 02:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
that statute
 
02:29:05.550 --> 02:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:08.429 --> 02:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative perinel I just
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
again want to bring us back to the
 
02:29:12.429 --> 02:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
purpose is that we're not approving
 
02:29:14.269 --> 02:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
these we're making we're reviewing and
 
02:29:17.070 --> 02:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
making recommendations thank
 
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
you okay all those in favor I I four and
 
02:29:23.389 --> 02:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
those opposed
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
so we had now we had nothing else that
 
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
we had discussed earlier from previous
 
02:29:38.110 --> 02:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
sessions relative to the front side like
 
02:29:39.309 --> 02:29:39.319 align:start position:0%
to have a
 
02:29:43.309 --> 02:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
motion and the motion would uh basically
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
reference that first change
 
02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
that I believe they've already made but
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
we would our rec recommendation would be
 
02:29:52.269 --> 02:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
contention upon
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
that that the definition of educator
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
reflect the
 
02:30:00.309 --> 02:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
RSA somebody want to make a motion here
 
02:30:03.150 --> 02:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli so
 
02:30:06.510 --> 02:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
move to approve the back half and the
 
02:30:10.710 --> 02:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
front half both yes the the entire 306
 
02:30:14.469 --> 02:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
proposed rules with the um
 
02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation also of the the educator
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
reference to existing statute yep and is
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
there a second m m Mr chair second was
 
02:30:27.510 --> 02:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
made by represent P yeah just being
 
02:30:29.469 --> 02:30:29.479 align:start position:0%
really clear on the motion the motion is
 
02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
not to approve as representative pet
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
said it's to recommend and and being
 
02:30:36.510 --> 02:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
very specific it's recommending to the
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
State Board which is which is our um
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
statutory yeah so so could could could
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
the motion be that uh the motion be to
 
02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
recommend to the state board that uh
 
02:30:51.070 --> 02:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
that the rules um as presented with the
 
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
one change to um the definition of
 
02:30:56.910 --> 02:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
educator to the state board and jalkar
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
nope our our just to the State Board
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
okay for just making it to the is that
 
02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
good with a second to the State
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
Board okay all those in favor of the
 
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
motion I and those opposed two oppose so
 
02:31:17.429 --> 02:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
it's 4 to2 to recommend to the State
 
02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
Board uh that we support the
 
02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
rules the front and the
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
back pending the decision
 
02:31:31.790 --> 02:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
to amend the section dealing with
 
02:31:33.309 --> 02:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
educator to
 
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
reflect the RSA definition of
 
02:31:41.469 --> 02:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
educator okay so that's where we
 
02:31:43.870 --> 02:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
are that's where we end that's where we
 
02:31:47.070 --> 02:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
end that's where we end
 
02:31:51.309 --> 02:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
um certainly that okay we'll just leave
 
02:31:55.590 --> 02:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
there yeah any further
 
02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
discussion not seeing we are
 
02:32:04.750 --> 02:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah get my optometrist get my
 
02:32:12.269 --> 02:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
glasses yeah I was I was bushwacking
 
02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
behind the house and the classes fell
 
02:32:17.269 --> 02:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
off in this stuff and it was on the side
 
02:32:19.510 --> 02:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
of a cliff I couldn't find them so I'm
 
02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:48.840 --> 02:33:18.750 align:start position:0%
 
these

02:33:18.750 --> 02:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
