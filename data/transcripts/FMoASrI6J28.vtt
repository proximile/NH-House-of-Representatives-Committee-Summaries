feel that she'll be recovered by
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%

you she's a tough lady and she'll

probably be at at work in three days and
 
00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:11.879 align:start position:0%
make sure can't see me makes it the same
 
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
thing she calls a Wonder
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
Woman the other announcement is uh we
 
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
have a meeting next Monday February
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
22nd and originally we had one bill the
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
final bill assigned to this committee to
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
discuss but because we had to suspend or
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
recess the public hearings on two other
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
bills HB 213 and HB
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
315 on Monday we will be
 
00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:43.430 align:start position:0%
315 on Monday we will be
resuming

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:45.879 align:start position:0%
the I just realized that sounds kind of
 
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
funny since we're using Zoom
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
resuming anyway we will be resuming the
 
00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
public hearings on 213 and 3:15 11
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
o'clock for 2113 and 1:00 for 3
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
50 as a result of that the exact session
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
activity that I had originally planned
 
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
for that day will be substantially
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
delayed so I have resumed reserved
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
rather a room for us on Monday March
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
8th and I want you all to realize that
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
that will be probably exclusively an
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
exec session day so we'll have to exec
 
00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:31.519 align:start position:0%
all the bills that we haven't
 
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
exec prior to that on that day because
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
on March
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
11th the house rules say that we have to
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
have all of our bills finished and done
 
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
with so March 8th is going to be an
 
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
extremely important day I hope everybody
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
will be here and I hope we can get
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
through all the exact exact sessions
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
that we'll have to get through that
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
day one other uh representative Thomas
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank M do we do we have the room here
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
on March 8 for as long as it takes to
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
exec all the
 
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
bills uh we have the room from 9 to 5
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
will that be enough time to exec all the
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
bills that's kind of up to the to the
 
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
committee I certainly hope so because if
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
not then we'll have to make other
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
arrangements and I don't know what those
 
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
arrangements will be but thank you for
 
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.110 align:start position:0%
arrangements will be but thank you for
that

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
question okay one more uh quick item I
 
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
was having a conversation with a friend
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
of mine the other day about the rather
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
difficult circumstances that uh the
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
people in the state of Texas have gone
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
through in the course of the last
 
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
several days with a kind of a collapse
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
of their electricity
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
Market and my friend was pointing out
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
that Texas
 
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
unlike ISO New England and and other
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
markets around the country
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
Market a capacity Market really is kind
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
of like an insurance
 
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839 align:start position:0%
policy you pay a little each month to
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
make sure that when things go wrong
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
backup generators can step in to fill
 
00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:15.990 align:start position:0%
backup generators can step in to fill
the

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
Gap well Tech Texas didn't have that uh
 
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
ability because they have no cap
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
capacity Market they have plenty of
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
generation available in Texas but
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
because they weren't paying people to be
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
on stand
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
by uh they weren't able to ramp up
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
quickly and get their their Market uh
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
moving again there were high price
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
signals that should have pred generators
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
to fire up but if they're not staffed it
 
00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:47.959 align:start position:0%
takes time to fire up they just weren't
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
prepared to do so
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
quickly which they would have been able
 
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
to do had they had a capacity Market no
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
a capacity Market though really isn't
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
just a capacity Market it's really a
 
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.829 align:start position:0%
just a capacity Market it's really a
reliability

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:02.839 align:start position:0%
reliability
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
Market that's the way we should think of
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
the capacity Market because it is an
 
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.269 align:start position:0%
the capacity Market because it is an
insurance

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
policy and it relies on Basel load
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
OnDemand dispatchable resources not
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
intermittent resources to get us through
 
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.870 align:start position:0%
intermittent resources to get us through
an

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
emergency and that's a good reminder
 
00:11:25.949 --> 00:11:25.959 align:start position:0%
that if you put all your eggs in one
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
basket you can be in
 
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
trouble it would be like uh investing
 
00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:34.839 align:start position:0%
all your retirement funds in one
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
stock if that stock is doing well you're
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
doing well but if that stock goes bad
 
00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
there goes all your retirement
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
Savings Mr chairman I must protest that
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
that is not the facts of what happened
 
00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:49.870 align:start position:0%
that is not the facts of what happened
in

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
Texas of what went offline was natural
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
gas that
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
froze that that may be true but uh hang
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
on a second let me finish what I was
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
trying to say here what I'm what I'm
 
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
getting at is an all electric energy
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
sector would create a massive single
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
point of failure for our entire
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
economy and I don't think that's a risk
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
that we want to take and Texas I think
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
is a good warning sign for all of us
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
that uh you can't allow your reliability
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
sector to be rotted
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
out little by little over
 
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
time in the pursuit of some particular
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
fad of the day so with that I would like
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
to uh get this show on the road it's now
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
9:14 we're already few minutes Mr
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I have my hand up J why okay go
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah let the chairman call on
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
us uh yes representative McGee did you
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
have a question yeah thank you um I
 
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
noted that you gave us four um bills
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
that you were considering for exec if we
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
have time in between sessions today and
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate that and it looks
 
00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839 align:start position:0%
like we have a full exec session
 
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled for the 8th but I was
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
wondering if you also had plans for
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
Monday if there's extra time so we could
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
get that on the books and be ready over
 
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
the weekend for anything that might be
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
exec on the
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
22nd yes uh we will be executing on the
 
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
22nd time
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
permitting representative Cali pittz all
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
I was gonna do all I want you to do is
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
ask fa if when the invest there's an
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
investigation right now when that
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
investigation is done in Texas I would
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
really like to have somebody come and
 
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
talk to us and tell us exactly what
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
happened why it happened and what
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to do to uh remedy the
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
situation once that investigation is
 
00:13:59.069 --> 00:13:59.079 align:start position:0%
complete so I would ask that you keep
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
that in the back of your mind good idea
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that suggestion
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
representative samage uh yes thank you
 
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh Mr chairman I would like
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
to just point out two two errors in the
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
calendar that just came out the two
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
bills that are in the regular calendar
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
incorrect for for one bill the 614 there
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
is no vote vote tally it just be uh 11
 
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
to9 and for the second uh Bill
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
624 there is a vote tell that's
 
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
incorrect that should be
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
1110 okay I will let our committee
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
committee researcher and our admin know
 
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
um that those numbers were reported
 
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
incorrectly to the to the clerk okay I
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
don't know how that happened but it's
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
not our responsibility I think it's
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
handled by the committee researcher and
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
the admin but I'll talk to them about it
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
and see what what we can do to make sure
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't happen again
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate it Mr chair my question was
 
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
specifically which bills would be exact
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
on Monday because I know you have a at
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
least a plan of what is coming or what
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to be doing so that we
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
could also do that work over the weekend
 
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
and be prepared for those exact sessions
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
I know we may not get to the I will send
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
that information to representative ssuch
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative Lang you are now
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to talk and the floor is yours
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
for three minutes thank you Mr chairman
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members for taking
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
my testimony um I am representative Tim
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
Lang from the towns of Tilton and samton
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
I serve as a chair of fishing game uh
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
and I am before you on House Bill
 
00:16:28.829 --> 00:16:28.839 align:start position:0%
106 um this house bill if you the
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
testimony is going to be kind of a
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
repeat for you if you if you've been on
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
Science and Tech for more than one year
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
um this bill comes back as is a redo
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
from last year House Bill
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
1402 which was intrm studied and
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation on a
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
vote of 14 to1 um in in a weird twist of
 
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
fate today is exactly one year to the
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
day since we inum studied this bill on
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
the house floor um and represent McGee
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
there spoke against this bill and then
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
in another twist fate she is a
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill with me this
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
year um and what this bill does is it it
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
removes the one megabit me megawatt cap
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
sorry megabit I'm a technologist so I
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
think that way sometimes um it removes
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
the one megawatt cap for a limited set
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
of circumstances those circumstances
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
involve what is a new classification of
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
generator called um a minicipal host um
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
a municipal host generator is a a a a a
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
solar or or a clean energy um generator
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
that solely sells power to uh political
 
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and the issue may you may
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
be asking why I've limited this bill and
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
having having served my third term here
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
now and having sat on Science and Tech
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
at least a dozen times um one of the
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
things I I was kind of amazed when I was
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
doing my research is I went back to see
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
when the first net metering bill or net
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
Energy bill was submitted and that bill
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
was submitted in in
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
2002 by representative Pitts on this
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
committee um and and so this is a
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
conversation that's been going on a long
 
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
time um and like I said in my in my term
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
in the house I've sat on Science and
 
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
Tech several many times um and one of
 
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
the conversations that always comes
 
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
around talks about data um and the data
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
what's it going to do to our grid what's
 
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
it going to do to the rate payers what's
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
going to do um to the to the U Market um
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
and so what what I offer you as this
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
bill as a as a as a point is is two
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
points number one this gives us the
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
ability to do a pilot project a and see
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
what the results will be uh in a in some
 
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
limited circumstances without throwing
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
the doors wide open but it'll allow us
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
to to expand our clean energy and green
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
energy Market um under a li limited set
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
of circumstances and then take a take a
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
breath and look back and see what that
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
did to our infrastructure um a lot of
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
the conversation I've heard in the past
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
in this committee around around Net
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
metering bills was always about cost and
 
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
and and actions on the grid and we
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
always try to extrapolate what other
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
states have done and how it relates to
 
00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire and here this will give us
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to actually see what's
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
going to happen in New Hampshire um this
 
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
would allow towns and cities to be able
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
to put up um arrays and group net meter
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
all the political subdivisions in this T
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
in that town and I I use as an example
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
um the town of bosin would be maybe a
 
00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
good example um the town of bosin has
 
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
not only it Town Hall it's Town Police
 
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
Department and fire department and
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
library it also happens to contain um
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
the political subdivision for the County
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
nursing home and the county jail so in
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
and of itself the town of Osa may not be
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
able to get a good return on investment
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
for the ability to uh put up a a large
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
solar array to pay the electrical cost
 
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
for those town-owned buildings but what
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow them to do is
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
contract with the um County as as well
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
because they're contained within the
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
borders for those two larger facilities
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
and be able to put up um an array and
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
sell the any any power that they're not
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
using um over to the um the county and
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
and to offset the cost of electricity
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
for both the nursing home and the jail
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
this would apply to any uh my own town I
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
again we have you know we're a smaller
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
town of of of about 2 200 voters um and
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
in that in in that we've got a small
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
police Department small fire department
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
um Library uh Town Hall but um we also
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
have a school district that's a Regional
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
School District that we have one of the
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
elementary schools in here so again my
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
town if it felt it was uh they can get
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
the return on of investment for them and
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
the savings necessary they could put up
 
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
an array and um and also offload include
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
the load for the school system in there
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
and sell that power to the school system
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
at lesser than retail rates and uh it
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
would save the school district money as
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
well and again so so it's a second
 
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
benefit of this bill is that not only do
 
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
we expand clean energy we get a pilot
 
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
project of uh what this would do to our
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we also have potential of
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
doing cost savings for our
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities which which ultimately
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
will help the local uh uh taxpayers um
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
one thing you'll see in this bill is
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
um uh no cap actually on this bill I
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
just uncapped I
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
didn't five megawatt and um and the
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
reason for that I wanted to Future proof
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
this bill so we don't have to keep
 
00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
coming back if FK should change their
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
rules um then we would have to come back
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
we set a 5 megawatt and FK moved it to
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
seven we'd have another argument moving
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
up to seven or if they dropped it down
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
to four then we'd have an argument about
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
moving it back down to four this bill
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
would future the way the Bill's written
 
00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:47.559 align:start position:0%
would future proof it allow it for
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
um uh to deal with the Federal
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
Regulations as they adjust and I'll
 
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative Lang I appreciate that I
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh initially misspoke and said I was
 
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
going to give you three minutes but
 
00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:03.799 align:start position:0%
actually Bill sponsors are allowed five
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
minutes and so I give you the full five
 
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
minutes now it kept me short thank you
 
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.630 align:start position:0%
minutes now it kept me short thank you
for

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
that uh so I I do have one question for
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
you um but I'm gonna call on
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas first because
 
00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I forgot my question so
 
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you to thank
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
you for my question
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
represent um um I'm a little concerned
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
on page two line six and seven and the
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
fact that you said that there was no cap
 
00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:36.039 align:start position:0%
uh does this not open the door even if
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's unintentional to
 
00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:41.799 align:start position:0%
um other entities that might take
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
advantage of having no cap have you
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
considered consequences and the fact
 
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.070 align:start position:0%
considered consequences and the fact
that

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
F probably would will never lower if its
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
rules so why not just keep the cap the
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
same right now and then if it needs to
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
be expanded come back to
 
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
later again I'm not opposed to that my
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
goal was try to Future proof the bill um
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
by by allowing the FK rules on on you
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
know right now it's five megawatts with
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
FK um and allow that be the guiding
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
factor for the state and and again you
 
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
know also I'm not opposed to it if the
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
committee wants to put a hard cap in
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
here have at it um again my goal is was
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
the future Pro it so we don't have to
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
continually come back I think I counted
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
when I did a net metering search and let
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
islative and net energy search somewhere
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
in the neighbor around 47 bills have
 
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
been submitted on those topics and my
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
goal was to reduce that work of
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
legislature and if this bill can be
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
elastic and adapt then I was hoping to
 
00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
do that but if the committee feels
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
that's not appropriate then it can
 
00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:47.590 align:start position:0%
that's not appropriate then it can
adjust

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
accordingly okay uh I remembered my
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
question you have heard testimony um
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative lying to a pilot project
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
but I don't see any language in the bill
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
that talks about a pilot project can you
 
00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:03.559 align:start position:0%
explain that further further please well
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
sure I didn't specifically call it a
 
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
pilot project in the bill because we're
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
meet we're we're opening this up and and
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
allowing municipality Municipal host
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
generators to do this um but in in
 
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
practicality that's exactly what we're
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
doing is we're creating a pilot project
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
because we have a limited number of
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
people that can um utilize this program
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
um we could then go back and look at
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
that data from those limited number of
 
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
users so um it guy like I said before
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
and so we I regularly do pilot projects
 
00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
on New on new technologies and we
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
Implement in one little given area and
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
see how it works and go back and and do
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
the research um and then I'll if it if
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
it worked then we we can expand it if it
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't work we can either pull it back
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
or we can just leave the pilot as it
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
exists if the if the Departments worked
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
on it so or departments made the
 
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
investment so again the way I looked at
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
it was in practicality it is a pilot
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
project even though I didn't
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
particularly write that language into
 
00:24:58.679 --> 00:24:59.789 align:start position:0%
particularly write that language into
the

00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank you um next up
 
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
representative Cali pittz has a
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
question yes representative Lange thanks
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
for dusting off an old bill um I'm
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about line 18 can you tell me
 
00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
why you put in that line a municipal
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
host may be owned by either a public or
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
private entity now I understand them the
 
00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
Municipal maybe wanting to get in that
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
and trying it to wet its feet in that
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
but what about the private entity and
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
would the municipalities still retain
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
control thank you for your question
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
ma'am um representative pittz so again
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
the idea behind this was I was concerned
 
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
about lease Arrangements where a
 
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
municipality may enter into a lease
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
arrangement for an array that's put on
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
top of their landfill say um and then
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
they don't technically own that property
 
00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
they're paying a lease on it usually
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
like a dollar buyout at the end and so I
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to allow those kind of
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
a lease and private public relationships
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
it also would come into play with if
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
there was um a generator that um wished
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
to uh put up an array and and make an
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
arrangement with the town to completely
 
00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:21.559 align:start position:0%
sell the power to the town 100% of the
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
um members of the of the group net
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
meeting would have to be political
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
subdivisions then I don't know why we
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want while back um and it would
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
be an arrangement a private public
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
relationship Arrangement between
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
municipality and the private
 
00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
owner may I follow up follow
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
up okay my concern there sir is the cost
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
that once you let rates Etc go out to
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
private entity private entity wants to
 
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.510 align:start position:0%
private entity private entity wants to
make

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
money and they're not perhaps regulated
 
00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
so the cost cost wouldn't be controlled
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe not necessarily less than what
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
was happening
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
so is that something You' thought about
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm not quite sure I understand your
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
question but um again the town's not
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
going to enter into an arrangement
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's not cost um or or city or or any
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
political subdivision that's not going
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
to be uh cost effective for them um and
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
so and the same with any business owners
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
not going to go into an arrangement
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
where that's not cost effective for them
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
if they can't if they can't get their
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
cost back and make some profit then the
 
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
bus not I don't know very many business
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
owners are going to do that kind of
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
business um and so I'm not quite sure I
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
understand your question um so maybe you
 
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
can restate it I'll try to answer it
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
what's efficacious today what says I can
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
make a profit today may not be true
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and if if there's no regulation
 
00:27:58.029 --> 00:27:58.039 align:start position:0%
no oversight no caps no
 
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
then there could be a problem that's all
 
00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:01.630 align:start position:0%
then there could be a problem that's all
I'm

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
saying thank you for the question again
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
I I I guess I I I can't look in the
 
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
future and guess what might happen with
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
the rates again you you'll notice
 
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
nowhere through here do we talk about
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
rates um the existing current statute is
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
everything is still controlling when it
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
comes to rates and on on metering the
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
only thing we're basically doing here is
 
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh taking the cap off for a li limited
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
set of circumstances and allowing uh
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
towns to engage in what they feel is
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
their best opportunity um as it comes to
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
Green energy and costs thank you thank
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
Harrington for a
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh actually
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's a couple um my first one is uh
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
the extension of this over one megawatt
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
what is the rate that would be paid to
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
the electricity that this uh project put
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
back onto the grid so again represent
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
herting thank you for the question again
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
nowhere in this bill do I talk about
 
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
rates the rates would be the existing
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
rates as as it is currently defined for
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
up to one
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
megawatt so you would then talk about
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
followup Mr
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
chairman yes go ahead okay so the
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
existing rate for up to one megawatt is
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
to pay full default service rate so
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
you'd be you uh what you're talking
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
about here is full default service rate
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
for up to 5 megawatts and possibly if FK
 
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
change they M 10 or 20 or 30 megawatts
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
is that correct uh I would say yes to
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
that they I'm I'm I'm taking your on
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
trust that that is what the law
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
says and just one more followup Mr
 
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
chairman yes go ahead it's you've also
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
Incorporated this in with you brought in
 
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
not just the municipals here but also
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
the lowi income what is the term uh low
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
income low moderate income Community
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
solar project so in that case
 
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
again they could go the over the one
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
megawatt limit be paid the default
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
service rate doesn't this involve more
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
almost like a welfare program for cost
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
shifting to the lowincome people rather
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
than simply support them through
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
attacks representative herting thank you
 
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
very much for that question that was
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
something I forgot to cover in my
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
testimony I I've emailed the entire
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
committee an amendment to this bill and
 
00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
it would strike the language regarding
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
to the uh low to moderate income
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
Community solar Pro and the reason I was
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
considering I I would ask the committee
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
to strike that language with that
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
amendment is because what I didn't
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
realize is on 724 of 19 Senate Bill 165
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
was passed um and in that bill there's
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
some specific language and one of the
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
things it talks about is that onor
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
before July 1st 2022 the commission
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
shall report on the cost and benefits of
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
such addition and the development of the
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
market for load of moderate income
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
Community solar projects and provide a
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
recommendation and what I wouldn't want
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
to do is upset the data um and so right
 
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
now apparently there is a mechanism in
 
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
for those projects and for pu to be able
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
to uh do a a report relative to those
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
projects and I I I wouldn't want to
 
00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
insert a new variable into this
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
discussion until um pu came out with
 
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
that so I'd humbly asked the committee
 
00:31:18.909 --> 00:31:18.919 align:start position:0%
to I I did the footw for the leg work
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
for you and and and sent the uh
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
amendment in um so you guys could adopt
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
it if you chose to strike that language
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
but I do think that would upset the
 
00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
apple cart for a previous law that we
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
have that's looking at this data and
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
they we're going to insert a new
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
variable into it so I'd ask you to
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
strike that
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
language okay thank you uh
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative L and representative
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
Harrington I'd like to point out before
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
I call on the next questioner that we
 
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919 align:start position:0%
have eight people signed up to speak on
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
this bill and we have 27 minutes left in
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
this public hearing so representative
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
samon just recognized for a question
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
you representative Lang uh I got to say
 
00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
that I like your bill uh I I like the
 
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
fact that you're thinking ahead and just
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
saying let's not have a cap
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
obvious yeah so obviously um that means
 
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
that whatever is possible people can do
 
00:32:22.029 --> 00:32:22.039 align:start position:0%
so what I wanted to ask you is can you
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
again uh reiterate what you think is the
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
primary benefit to municip alties and
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
political entities of this bill what's
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
the primary benefit that you see so the
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
primary benefit I see for the
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities if if they can again this
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
goes back to their Contracting but if
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
they can negotiate a good rate with
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
getting a a clean energy we'll use a
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
solar because it's the simplest
 
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:46.519 align:start position:0%
conversation point the most common one
 
00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
if they can arrange an uh putting up a
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
solar array to offset their electricity
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
costs um you're going to see a a
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
reduction in the operating expenses for
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities and hopefully an
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
operating expense reduction results in
 
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
property tax relief so um that is my
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
consideration for the best benefit of
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
this thing followup Mr chairman follow
 
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
up uh okay so that so that's I think
 
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
that's a really good goal can you tell
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
me why this is not possible for them to
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
do that right
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
now I believe it's the aggregation
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
component and allowing and again I'm
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
going to use the the conversation Point
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
around um bosquin
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
um using multiple entities to be able to
 
00:33:32.629 --> 00:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
do that and ability to uh virtually
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
group all those uh meters behind a
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
virtual meter and offset the entire uh
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh grid for that the entire electrical
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
consumption for that thank you thank you
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
representative partial has recognized
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
question uh very quickly uh
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative Lang very very good Bill
 
00:33:57.629 --> 00:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for drafting it uh the
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that you attached on your
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
email I do not seem to have uh receiv
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
received that Amendment perhaps I'm
 
00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
alone but could you please double check
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
I will send it again I just sent it me
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
just shortly ago so uh right before the
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh public hearing started OLS had sent
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
it to me okay thank you so much thank
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee is recognized
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
for question thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
actually wanted to just add something as
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor I'm I'm not asking a
 
00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
question but I'm answering a question
 
00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079 align:start position:0%
from before about how municipalities and
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions would use this
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
because I live in a town that's already
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
made Investments and they are not in a
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
position at this point to recover uh
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
those investments in the way that they
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
were intended for anything over one
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
megawatt at this point so I know that
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
their their Investments were based on um
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
following a plan that would allow us to
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
lower those rates uh for the you know
 
00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
for the town um and so we have
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
significantly low lowered our costs but
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
we are still not recovering or gaining
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
credit uh for the amount generated in
 
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
excess of what our needs are and so
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
that's the other piece um that I think a
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
lot of folks are waiting for because in
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
some cases it's not backed-up projects
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
but projects that have already been put
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
into play so I just wanted to mention
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
that uh as who would
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
benefit uh J recognizes representative
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.829 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington did you have a
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
question I was muted sorry I think I'm
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now yes okay thank you
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
question representative Lang on the
 
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
second page starting on line 13 talks
 
00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
about a municipal house is a customer
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
generator with a total Peak generating
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
capacity of greater than one megawatt
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
used to offset the electricity
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
requirements of a group my question is
 
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
so if it's less than one megawatt it's
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
not a municipal host that would be part
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
one and if it is a municipal house can
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
the output above one megawatt only be
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
used to offset the electrical
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
requirements of a group or can some of
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
that electricity be fed back into the uh
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
grid and they get payments for that so
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
again the intention of the bill when it
 
00:36:22.829 --> 00:36:22.839 align:start position:0%
was drafted was to offset the the usage
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
um and again allowing this this concept
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
of a virtual meter um behind all town or
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions within a single
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
municipality to offset that electrical
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
usage so and again I the way I read it
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
in this language um was intended for the
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
entire consumption so if you put a 2.5
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
megawatt uh array up you don't have to
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
go to Five you could put a two megawatt
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
Ray up um the the consumption of that
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
two megawatt would be within that
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
Community for the political subdivisions
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
followup Mr
 
00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up try to make it quick
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'm still a little confused
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
let me just give you for instance so uh
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
one of these Municipal hosts decided to
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
put up a lease from a private entity a 4
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
and a half megawatt facility but the
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
maximum load for the municipal host was
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
75 megawatts would they be able to do
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
that and then sell the rest of their
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
output because they' never use more than
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
75 whatever that Surplus was would they
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
be able to sell that back to the Grid at
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
right I'm going to say in that concept
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
that in conceptually yes that Pro that
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
could happen um I I don't see imp
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
practicality of that happening but yes I
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
do I do see that as a possibility and
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
again I'd be open to if you feel there's
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
better language I could clean that up so
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen that's not the
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
intention of the bill the bill the
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
intention of the bill is to lower
 
00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
electric cost municipalities and not
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
create a revenue stream for
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities okay thank you very much
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGee we really need to
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
move on can you can you hold that
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
question yeah it wasn't a question I was
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
going to try and answer that further
 
00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.510 align:start position:0%
going to try and answer that further
but

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate it thank you so on our
 
00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
next speaker who is Clifton Belo from
 
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
Lebanon New Hampshire uh representing
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon Mr V the floor is
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
yours for two minutes thank you Mr
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um I am as he said assistant
 
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
mayor of the city of Lebanon testifying
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the City generally
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill I do have a
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
couple of concerns um I did send out a
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
suggested Amendment um uh although you
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
just received it so I haven't had a
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
chance to look at it it uh would uh put
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
the 5 megawatt um uh limit into the bill
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh to specify that to participate in the
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh as a group Municipal group host it
 
00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839 align:start position:0%
have to be less than 5 megawatts the
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
reason for that is because that is a
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
hard and fast boundary that has been in
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
existence at for at least 20 years I
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
think actually probably quite a bit
 
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
longer uh any generator that's 5
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
megawatts or larger um by definition
 
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
essentially you know has to register
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
with ISO New England as a uh FK
 
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional generator it's
 
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
participating in the Interstate
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
Wholesale markets of which FK has
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
exclusive jurisdiction um the state has
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
exclusive jurisdiction over distribution
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
and within State wholesale sales but
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
only for generators that are not
 
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
participating in the interstate market
 
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
so I think that 5 megawatt limit is
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
important um another way to say this
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
would be to say a customer generator
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
that participates in net metering shall
 
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
not participate in is and New England
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
markets as a generator or network
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
resource um I've also uh sent along um
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh a neor brief on this issue that um
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
gives a lot of background on the just
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional boundary and in my last
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
30 seconds um another concern that I
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
didn't put in my letter but it's some
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
significance is the fact that um you
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
might want to consider netting out the
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
RPS compliance cost because for four
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
megawatt solar project um it would
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
generate um about 5.3 million kilowatt
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
hours a year and uh the RPS compliance
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
cost for that would be about $40,000 and
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
if you're selling it at the same if
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
compensating at the same rate you're
 
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
turning around and um delivering it to
 
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
another customer there's $40,000 RPS
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
compliance for which there's no revenue
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
and that cost would have to be shifted
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
to other rate paays and and so I think
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
that's problematic for these large
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
systems thank
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
you thank you very well done two minutes
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
and seven seconds appreciate that any
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
Belo seeing none we will move on to our
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
next speaker who is Donna gamos
 
00:40:59.550 --> 00:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
representing ever Source um and Miss
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
gash is listed as opposing the bill so
 
00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.270 align:start position:0%
gash is listed as opposing the bill so
miss

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
miss
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
gash find you on the list here I should
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
apologize okay Miss gash you are allowed
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
to speak unmute unmute yourself and take
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
it away two minutes thank you very much
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh very briefly um we are test on on
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
behalf of eversource uh energy I'm
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
testifying um in opposition to House
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 106 but only just to raise a couple
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
of concerns with some of the details um
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
because the idea of Municipal host
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
generators is not something that we
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
oppos um with that the first issue with
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is that just as you just heard
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
from Mr Belo that we believe there
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
should be a cap for each facility
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
without a cap um very large projects um
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
could earn the net metering compensation
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
rather than getting the wholesale
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
market-based compensation and um it
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
obviously the cap would be consistent
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
with Federal rules I wanted to just
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
share with you some examples um in
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
speaking with Rick lebre whom some of
 
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
you know we have six large projects in
 
00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
our que right now combin they total 100
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
megawatts you can do the math if you
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
only divide um 100 by six each project
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh if they were e of equal size would be
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
roughly 17 megawatts um so right out of
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
the gate the projects are larger than
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
five megawatts the second issue we have
 
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
is that the language uh on page one
 
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
lines 15 and 16 is unclear on whether
 
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
all group members must be political
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
subdivisions or just one or more and
 
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
it's the one or more language I'm
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
speaking about if that is the intent
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
then it would be very easy for a very
 
00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:46.839 align:start position:0%
large generator to assemble a group of
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
say six Walmarts um to to um participate
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
as a municipal group host and then our
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
third issue um under section two
 
00:42:59.790 --> 00:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
beginning um page two beginning on line
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
eight the language attempts to negate
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
any provisions of settlement agreements
 
00:43:06.549 --> 00:43:06.559 align:start position:0%
or orders related to qualifying
 
00:43:08.109 --> 00:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
facilities and independent power
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
producers we really don't know what the
 
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of the language is but for over
 
00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:14.559 align:start position:0%
the last 40 plus years there have been
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
dozens of voluminous settlements and
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
orders and we really don't know um what
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
the intent of the purposes so um oh one
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
last thing we have um I think it's on
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
page one line 21 there is a reference to
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
a customer being an entity you know in
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
quotes created for a special purpose we
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what it means or what the
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
purpose is so from from our perspective
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
we just have a lot of questions that we
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
need answered the main issue we have is
 
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
just including the cap and with that
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you uh not bad two
 
00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
minutes and 16 seconds uh representative
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
Thomas is recognized for a question
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for take my
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
question I just have a ask your question
 
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
would would this bill um in any way uh
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
either negate or or um
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
supered the current law that requires
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities from uh
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
purchasing uh extra renewable energy
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
that people
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
produce I think I think I think I know
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
where you're going with that I don't
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
think that's the intent but there is
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
some ambiguity in the legislation so I
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
understand why you asked that question
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
our lawyers don't think that that um is
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
the intent but again we've raised a few
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
ambiguities today so um I would say
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.549 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
no

00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
thank thank you uh representative ssuch
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
question uh thanks Mr chairman and thank
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
you M mamash for taking my question um
 
00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
does eversource already participate in
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
in the similar concept that is proposed
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
here in other states of new New
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
England um we do participate in net
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
metering in other states and the two
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
other states that we participate in are
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Connecticut and in and
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
in both cases they have five megawatt
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
caps thank you thank you okay thank you
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh any other
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we will call on
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
our next speaker who is Steve Steve
 
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
zaretti a lobbyist for Brookfield
 
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
Steve there you are okay Steve you're on
 
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
and you're allowed to speak for two
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
minutes great good morning can you hear
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
me we can thank you great I'll be brief
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
um for your reference Brookfield
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
Renewable owns and operates 144
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
megawatts of generating capacity within
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
the state that includes several
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
smallscale hydropower units um we are
 
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
supportive of HB 106 uh we think this is
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
a great step for expanding access to
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and for uh local
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
control of energy sources um and in
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
particular we're very supportive of
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
language in the bill um that tries to
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
address interconnection limitations uh
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
that impact just a few existing
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
smallscale Hydro facilities in the state
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
and that includes four small units in
 
00:46:34.829 --> 00:46:34.839 align:start position:0%
Berlin and Goram that Brookfield owns
 
00:46:34.839 --> 00:46:35.670 align:start position:0%
Berlin and Goram that Brookfield owns
and

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
operates if we didn't include this
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
clarifying provision in section two uh
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
those units could be shut out from
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
participating in the program uh even if
 
00:46:47.069 --> 00:46:47.079 align:start position:0%
the program were expanded um considering
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
there is some discussion here around a 5
 
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap being implemented uh in a
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
future draft so that would of course
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
prevent the from serving interested
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
public um off-takers if if there weren't
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
clarifying language included so again we
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
are very supportive of this bill uh and
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for the opportunity to
 
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:09.559 align:start position:0%
comment thank you very much any
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr zeret representative
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
Samson has recognized for a
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr Zer for testifying uh can I just
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
have a clarification a little bit about
 
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
what your answer was about the cap um uh
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
if I did are correctly are you in
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
opposition to capping this do you like
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that there is no cap and
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be self- enforcement
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
anyway if if the if you went over a cap
 
00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:41.559 align:start position:0%
that was not allowed by FK uh The Entity
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
doing it would have to adjust itself
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
differently wouldn't that be the case so
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
so the the language that I'm referencing
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
um what IT addresses is the fact that
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
there are some hydropower facilities in
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um that under the current
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
rules of the program would be deemed as
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
aggregate units and so if there were a
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
cap of say five megawatts some units
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
that are you know two or three megawatts
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
might be aggregated together and then
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
not be able to participate in the
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
program because they would exceed the 5
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap so not taking a position on
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
the cap just saying that if a cap is
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
introduced to this discussion uh this
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
language becomes necessary for that
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
reason okay thank you very
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
much uh four speakers to go in 10
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
minutes I now
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
recognize Miss Heidi
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
um I know you're here somewhere there
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
you are Miss Heidi Crow you are
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak for two minutes um
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I actually if I
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
could have four um I'm testifying on
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
behalf of both the granite state Hydro
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
Power Association and badok paper
 
00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
mills okay well compromise on three
 
00:48:59.549 --> 00:48:59.559 align:start position:0%
how's that all right I will try to be
 
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
very quick um so Granite State Hydro
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
Power Association um supports House Bill
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
106 um we support the fact that it will
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
remove the one megawatt cap on the size
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
of renewable facilities that are
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate in net metering
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
um uh I will say that to address one of
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
the questions that came up um Hydro
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
power facilities uh the way
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
representative Lang has written this
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
bill and we do appreciate it hydr power
 
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
facilities would be able to serve um mun
 
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.390 align:start position:0%
facilities would be able to serve um mun
political

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
subdivisions um whether that's schools
 
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:31.470 align:start position:0%
subdivisions um whether that's schools
or

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities um you know anything even
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
if you do put in a cap um anything up to
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
five megawatts um regardless you know
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
that the hydro facilities could be
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
outside of a municipality and he
 
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
recognizes that um and we very much
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate that because obviously new no
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
new Hydro facilities are being built um
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
and uh you can't relocate them it's not
 
00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:55.799 align:start position:0%
like solar where you have some
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility about where those are cited
 
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
um the other and we gsha also supports
 
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill which we feel
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
includes Provisions that ensure a Level
 
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
Playing Field um I will say from anad
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
paper mills perspective um you heard
 
00:50:14.829 --> 00:50:14.839 align:start position:0%
from Mr zetti um the first section of
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
section two really deals with this uh
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
unique circumstance where multiple um
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
Hydro facilities it's Unique um to hydro
 
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
facilities and we're only aware of um
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
ours and and uh the North country that
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Z spoke of uh manado paper mills has
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
three small Hydro facilities each are
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
under one megawatt they are all behind
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
the meter and they share a single
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
interconnection point with the grid um
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
namely the Mills interconnection point
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
with eversource and so they have been um
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
those three Hydro facilities they're
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
independently um licensed by furk and
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
they uh are independently recognized by
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
the Pu as RPS eligible but because of
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
this uh kind of aggregation problem
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
they've been shut out from net metering
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
so the language in section two would
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
address that problem we've saw this
 
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
language last year and it had bipartisan
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
support and we would hope that you would
 
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
support it again this year um to address
 
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
the question that came up um the second
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
piece of um section two Miss gash had
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
some concerns or questions about it um
 
00:51:19.789 --> 00:51:19.799 align:start position:0%
it's simply to make sure small Hydro
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
facilities have been participating in
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
the wholesale Market as qfs and that
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
language is simply me to acknowledge
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
that um if they start participating in
 
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
net metering instead they will be
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
subjected to the net metering rules and
 
00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
laws um that the Pu has on the books um
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
so kind of making sure that they're um
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
playing by the same rules that any other
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
net metering facility would play by and
 
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions thank
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
you very
 
00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much Miss Gro any
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss Gro looks like Peter
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
ssuch has a question
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh just briefly
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
what what is a
 
00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
qf uh qualifying facility I'm sorry
 
00:52:03.319 --> 00:52:04.789 align:start position:0%
qf uh qualifying facility I'm sorry
thank

00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:04.799 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for miss croll
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will now recognize the
 
00:52:11.789 --> 00:52:11.799 align:start position:0%
next speaker Rob Warner who is a
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for the league of
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
conservation voters Mr Warner you have
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
the floor for two minutes thank you
 
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
chairman o and members of the committee
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
um I won't be long I just wanted to
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
point out an addition to the
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits of deploying more
 
00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:29.799 align:start position:0%
renewable energy across the state
 
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
through the municipal host platform I
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
think you should also consider this as
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
an economic development tool because of
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
the very large Investments that are are
 
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
going to come forward if municipalities
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
and other governmental units are
 
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
permitted to take this step it is a
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
certainly a significant step uh forward
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
and cities and towns will also gain the
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
economic benefit from tax arrangement
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
with providers through pilots and other
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh arrangements so I think that that's
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
significant for communities and lastly I
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh highlight that you should
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
have in your possession a letter from
 
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
many of the Mayors across the state that
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
are uh in support of this approach and
 
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
um I think I've come well under the uh
 
00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.069 align:start position:0%
um I think I've come well under the uh
time

00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
frame oh you sure did just a minute way
 
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.710 align:start position:0%
frame oh you sure did just a minute way
to

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
go thank you Mr wner any questions Mr
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
burner representative Samson just
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you Mr
 
00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you Mr burner for
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you alluded to the
 
00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
economic development opportunities and
 
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
that that this is kind this could be a
 
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
tool can you elaborate a little bit
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
about what do you think municipalities
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
how they could benefit from those kind
 
00:53:50.109 --> 00:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
of tools well in several ways I think
 
00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
that um you know again the pilot
 
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
agreements uh and such Arrangements that
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
communities will gain from hosting these
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
kinds of projects um but also um there's
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
a job and economic development uh aspect
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
to these projects because obviously are
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
going to employ people to build them and
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we expand this in
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
this way at this time I think it's going
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
to address um some job creation needs
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
that we really have uh in the State of
 
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
Affairs that we're in with the covid-19
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
so I I think that's going to be a
 
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh seeing no more
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
um Mr Warner I will
 
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
now turn it over to our next
 
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
speaker who
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
is Robert Hayden Mr Hayden represents
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
himself and standard power Mr Hayden you
 
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
have the floor for two
 
00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:55.799 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you representative oose
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
can you hear
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
me yes thank you so much and thank you
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
to everybody for their service on this
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
committee it's a pleasure to have the
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to you folks again
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's been a while I do support HB
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
106 um standard power currently
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
administers 25 small Hydro facilities
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
that are net metered to schools and
 
00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
towns here in New Hampshire so we have a
 
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
lot of experience in the smaller version
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
of these projects and the great success
 
00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:29.039 align:start position:0%
they've had uh through group net
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
metering we've returned over $3 million
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
since the Inception of the program in
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
2015 to New Hampshire entities
 
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of that has gone to schools
 
00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.069 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of that has gone to schools
and

00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
towns we currently serve over 50 schools
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
in towns in this net metering program we
 
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
have another 12 towns that would like to
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
join and a couple of school districts
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
that would like to join uh we do not
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
have that capacity right now even though
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
we've re-energized several facilities
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
this year and hope to re-energize a
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
third uh excuse me we re-energize two in
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
2020 and hope to re-energize a third in
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
2021 so even doing a program like that
 
00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
employs New Hampshire
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
folks um which I think is critically
 
00:56:22.829 --> 00:56:22.839 align:start position:0%
important a couple of uh towns we serve
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
that are worth mention Peterboro who's
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
been 100% green
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
for seven years uh Derry Rochester go go
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
and a few others um because this focuses
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
on Municipal entities it keeps all of
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
the benefits of net metering in the
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
state and when a thirdparty finances a
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
program like this the benefit is a fixed
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
benefit that can still go to the
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
community regardless of the def default
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
service rate that it's based
 
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
on uh my last point is that doing this
 
00:57:03.789 --> 00:57:03.799 align:start position:0%
as a pilot as has been kind of discussed
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
would minimize the impact on the
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
interconnection evaluation team at
 
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
eversource in Maine they were deluged
 
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
when they opened up the floodgates for
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
this kind of a program here starting it
 
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
off with a trickle of projects might be
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate with the expectation that it
 
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
would be extremely successful and be
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
able to proliferate in the future
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Hayden I appreciate
 
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
that uh any questions for Mr Hayden
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
looks like representative s has a
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
question go
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
Hayden uh and Mr Hayden it's really nice
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
to hear your voice again you've always
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
been a participant in these these
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
hearings uh my question is this to you
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
uh right now the projects that you
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
you're um mentoring or you're in charge
 
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
of uh has there been any movement in in
 
00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
that direction to include some kind of
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
energy storage as well that's a great
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
question and frankly the answer is a
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
little bit unique we've tried to um
 
00:58:08.589 --> 00:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
acquire a facility in Massachusetts to
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
work with their clean Peaks program to
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
determine the value statement and how to
 
00:58:17.069 --> 00:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
best introduce that into New Hampshire
 
00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
with that intellectual property in
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
addition we're I'm standard power is
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
participating in the storage docket
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's currently being held by the Pu
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
because we fully have the intent of
 
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
understanding and implementing battery
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
storage to not only help uh monetize the
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
value of the electricity but to minimize
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
the peak hour load that causes us to
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
enjoy a disproportionate amount of
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
transmission costs here in New
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based on the fact that
 
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:53.559 align:start position:0%
surrounding states have um outrun Us in
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
the production of solar and by virtue of
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
that it reduces their relative
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
transmission cost in relationship to New
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay thank you very much very
 
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
much no more questions for Mr Hayton I
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
will recognize well before I do that I'm
 
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.270 align:start position:0%
will recognize well before I do that I'm
going

00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
to open the public hearing on HB 294 and
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
recess that public hearing until we
 
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
finish this one and I will recognize our
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
final speaker who is meline mano
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
representing clean energy New Hampshire
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
Miss Mano you have the floor for two
 
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chairman um clean
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire supports this bill
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
and thanks representative Lang for
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
bringing it back uh We've long advocated
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
to allow larger energy users to
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
rightsize their renewable energy net
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
metered projects and this bill would do
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
that for political
 
00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
subdivisions um this bill though it is
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
limited allows for real progress for
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
renewable energy in New Hampshire that
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
would directly benefit our towns and
 
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
cities and your
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
constituents we are concerned that the
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
town boundary requiring that the host
 
01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:02.039 align:start position:0%
and all members be located within the
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
same municipality is overly
 
01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
restrictive um we think that two small
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
towns should be allowed to work together
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
on a project for example that a school
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
district that spans multiple towns
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to have one project
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
that serves all their schools and the
 
01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
electric grid is not organized according
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
to political subdivision to political
 
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
boundaries and so an interconnection
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
Point may be located in the next town
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
over um we are okay with um adding a cap
 
01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:32.599 align:start position:0%
that matches FK and ISO regulations as
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
other speakers have
 
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned um it is important to allow
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
the host to be privately owned um
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
because some towns don't have The
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
Upfront Capital to invest in a project
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
and so they may want to go into a power
 
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement or a leasing
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
agreement as representative Lang
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
explained and also uh existing Hydro
 
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
projects are not necessarily owned by
 
01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:57.799 align:start position:0%
the municipality but they may want to
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
serve uh the electrical usage of the
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions finally I want to
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
go into a little bit that this law would
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
use the existing group net metering um
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
statute and under group net metering
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
host generation must match group load if
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
the host generation is greater than the
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
member load then there's a true up that
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
goes into effect and a financial penalty
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
occurs so I want to be really clear that
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
the host could not um just export to the
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
grid and be compensated at default
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
service without serving the electrical
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
needs being matched with the electrical
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
usage of a political
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
subdivision they can't just export and
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
be compensated at default service unle
 
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
unless they're directly serving that
 
01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
load 15 seconds I'm done thank you okay
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
great thank you any questions for M Mano
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative McGee you recognized for
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
question oh thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Mano for taking my
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
question um could you say a little bit
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
more about the group net metering uh
 
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
default rates and how that works since
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
this bill uh is highly affected by how
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
that compensation comes in because I
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
think people might be having difficulty
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
understanding how that would work yes
 
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:17.799 align:start position:0%
thank you that's what I was trying to
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
get at the end of my testimony there but
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happy to have a little bit more
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
time to explain it in a little bit more
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
detail um representative Harrington
 
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:25.720 align:start position:0%
asked representative Lang when he was
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill if the host could
 
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
simply export energy to the grid without
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
serving the
 
01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
electricity use of a political
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
subdivision and be compensated at
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
default service and I wanted to clarify
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
that our group net metering statute and
 
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
the rules enacted by the Public
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission prevent that from
 
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
happening when you're a group net
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
metering host you must demonstrate on an
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
annual basis in an annual report that
 
01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.390 align:start position:0%
annual basis in an annual report that
your

01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:02:59.069 --> 01:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
generation is matched with the
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
electricity usage of your group members
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
so in this case you would have the
 
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
municipal host they could be serving the
 
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
town hall the County nursing home the
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
the school the electricity usage of
 
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
those members has to match the output of
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
the host and so that is an assurance
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
that you're not just acting like a
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
generator exporting to the grid but
 
01:03:23.309 --> 01:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
being compensated at the net metering
 
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
credit and if that does not occur there
 
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
is a trup that goes into effect and the
 
01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
host actually has to pay back money to
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
the utility the difference between the
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
credit they received and the avoided
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
cost which is much much lower and so
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
they make sure that that doesn't happen
 
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
because it's actually a pretty
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
significant financial penalty thank you
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's very helpful thank you okay thank
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
you very much the chair recognizes
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington don't forget
 
01:03:57.359 --> 01:04:03.750 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington don't forget
to

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
unmute representative Harrington are you
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
there can you hear me now yes okay um a
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
follow up on what was just discussed I'm
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
just trying to get this straight in my
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
mind you're saying that the true up you
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
know the true up is what based on total
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours used during the course of
 
01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:25.640 align:start position:0%
the year by the
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
host so the host typically does not have
 
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
significant load um what is required is
 
01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
an annual report
 
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrating the generation the export
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
from the host and the usage of all the
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
members and that has to match up so for
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
example just to use a round number it
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
was 100 megawatt hours that was exported
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
by the host the members have to have
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
used at least 100 megawatt hours in that
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
year if if say the members only used 90
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
and during the year the host was
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
compensated at default service for 100
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours the host will have to pay
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
back the difference between avoided cost
 
01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
and default service for those 10
 
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours that their members did
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
not use and make a payment to the
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
utility followup please follow up yeah
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh so it's it's then based on the total
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
me what hours uh the host consumes in a
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
year versus the amount that they export
 
01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
total for the year is that correct what
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
the host exported compared to the total
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
amount used by their members in their
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
group okay thank you okay representative
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
oxam you're recognized for a
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you mine and M minu for taking
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
the question uh no no one's mentioned
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
the the health value of the the the
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
change to using more renewable energy
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
which this bill will make possible um in
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
in many of our towns particular I'm
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
thinking of Kean where they're subject
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
to inversions there's a real issue um
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
and not that it's not a real issue
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
elsewhere it's just a more obvious and U
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
yes so could you please speak to that
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
issue which hasn't been mentioned
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely you know switching to more
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
clean renewable locally generated uh
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
electricity definitely has a lot of
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
potential to offer direct public health
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
benefits to our communities and that has
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
a real avoided cost um for another bill
 
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
testimony later today I emailed you um a
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
report that synapse energy economics
 
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
recently um put out and we're mostly
 
01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
focused on the avoided energy and
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
capacity costs but they also get at some
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
of the public health benefits of uh
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
local solar generation so I would
 
01:06:59.789 --> 01:06:59.799 align:start position:0%
reference that okay thank you the chair
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative for
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
Miss moo for taking my question um this
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
is going back in relation to the um
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
payment for sorry uh payment for kind of
 
01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
exceeding the capacity um what's the
 
01:07:16.839 --> 01:07:17.789 align:start position:0%
exceeding the capacity um what's the
reason

01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
for not having a bit of a buffer on top
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
of that say um you know don't exceed
 
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
110% or 120% of the demand it seems like
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
to to me it seems like it might be
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
useful to not penalize people for making
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit extra can you speak to why
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
that um is written that way yeah we uh
 
01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:41.799 align:start position:0%
we and our members uh many of whom are
 
01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
group net metering hosts would certainly
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate having a little bit more
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
flexibility in leeway but I think the
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
intent of groupnet metering is for a
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
host to serve a specific um specific
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
group members energy needs and so the
 
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
requirement is that the host the the
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
memb usage must equal or exceed and so
 
01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
the way to cover yourself a little bit
 
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
is to have a little bit more load in
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
your members than your generator is
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
likely to to produce and so it is very
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
strict and that's what I wanted to make
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
really clear that group net metering
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
hosts are not acting like generators and
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
merely exporting energy to the grid and
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
compensated at default service without
 
01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
being associated with specific customers
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
that they are serving in their
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
group thank you okay thank you very much
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh M Mano representative Samson you've
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
already had a question here so I think
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to conclude this public
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
hearing at this point we had 201 people
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
signed in in support of this bill two
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
opposed there were too many elected
 
01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
officials who signed in signed in to to
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
list here so with that report I will
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
106 and we will
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
immediately reopen that public hearing
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.709 --> 01:09:17.719 align:start position:0%
294 and I will call
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
on the substitute Prime sponsor
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lang to introduce this
 
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
Bill representative Lang you have five
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you thank you chairman
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
Bose and again I won't take full five
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
minutes uh we're already running late
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
over my last bill so um this bill came
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
out of discussions with the governor's
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
office again I'm apologize I'm
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
representative Tim Lang uh serving
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
belnap County 4 um this bill came out of
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
discussions with the governor's offices
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
and a group of legislators in the summer
 
01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.070 align:start position:0%
and a group of legislators in the summer
of

01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
2019 um this bill was brought forward
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
last session along with two other bills
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
including the one we just heard um these
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
bills were designed to break down the
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
governmental barriers and ensure rate
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
payer protections from higher
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
electricity rates and expand access to
 
01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
renewable energy um this bill is the
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
same as House Bill 1262 which was
 
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
introduced last year which was inum
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
studied uh and and recommended for
 
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.750 align:start position:0%
studied uh and and recommended for
future

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
legislation um and if you remember right
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 1262 along with the previous
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
Bill we had uh language was incorporated
 
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
into house bill 1218 which was the
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
larger grander size of a renewable
 
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
energy bill um this amends The Limited
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
energy I'm sorry The Limited electrical
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
energy producers act which was first
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
passed in
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
1979 it was looked at maximizing the
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities for Renewal Energy and
 
01:10:43.149 --> 01:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
break down those government barriers to
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
competition uh there's a lot of work and
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
amendments that went into the original
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
bill which were not reflected here it's
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding a great deal of work um
 
01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
and stakeholder discussion that still
 
01:10:54.669 --> 01:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
needs to occur needed to occur to move
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
forward but that's been done and this
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
bill is is adjusted for that um I
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
brought this bill forward again so we
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
can begin the additional work and uh the
 
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
challenge of uh that remains is
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
perfecting the bill to adequately
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
address stakeholder concerns I am not by
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
any stretch of imagination an expert in
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
the area of limited electrical energy
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
producers and I'm sure we're going to
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
have people coming uh behind me uh who
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
will have much better answer questions
 
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
so I rather not take questions but if
 
01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
someone really feels the need I I'll
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
answer okay thank you representative
 
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
Lang a minute and 51 56 seconds well
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
done are there any questions for
 
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative Lang we have two other
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
speakers who may be in a better position
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
to answer those
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none well okay we see
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
one at the last minute here
 
01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
representative McGee you recognize for a
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
question I was just wondering whether I
 
01:11:54.629 --> 01:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
should ask this question but I guess it
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
is relevant um representative Lang uh
 
01:11:59.070 --> 01:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question by the
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
way are you aware of the conversations
 
01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
that myself and representative Pearl had
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
about 294 and 407 because they're very
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
similar I I have I am not aware of those
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
conversations I shouldn't say that
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl didn't mention that
 
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
he had a conversation with you and you
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
have a similar bill in I don't know
 
01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
where they marry up and and where
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
they're the same and where they're
 
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
different so um again I apologize for
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%

01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
morning and asked me to introduce for
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
him because he was busy at work I I
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
understand Mr chairman may I just have a
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
followup uh since you're going to be

407 you a
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
clarification pardon just a
 
01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.830 align:start position:0%
clarification pardon just a
clarification

01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
from go ahead please is it your
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
understanding that that uh House Bill
 
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
294 is the same language as 1262 from
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding again but I I
 
01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
haven't gone back to look but my
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
understanding is yes this is the
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
original starting point of 1262 from
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
last year that was ultimately uh
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
incorporated into 1218 last year thank
 
01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
you appreciate
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
it our next speaker actually may be able
 
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
to answer corre
 
01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
again seeing no more questions for
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative Lang we thank you
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative Lang for introducing the
 
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
bill and for
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
standing in for representative Pearl I
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
hope all is well with him uh our next
 
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
speaker who uh I know is very
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about this bill because
 
01:13:36.669 --> 01:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
I've heard him speak on it many times
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
before is Clifton Belo of the city of
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
Lebanon elected official Mr Belo you
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
have the floor for three
 
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chairman members of
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
the committee again I'm assistant mayor
 
01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
of the city of Lebanon testifying on the
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
city's behalf um uh
 
01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
very supportive of this concept um this
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
is a market-based alternative uh for us
 
01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh distributed generation under 5
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
megawatts in size that is not
 
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
participating with ISO New England or um
 
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh in net metering
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
um it is something that's been on the
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
books for a very long time uh this
 
01:14:19.709 --> 01:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
section of the rsas it was actually last
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
amended when we actually uh did the
 
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
original net metering bill um way back
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
in 1997 and uh 9 UM 8 of which I was the
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor and representative badley
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
was the then this chair of this
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
committee and and the co-sponsor and
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
that bill actually went through
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
something like a dozen work sessions
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
over the course of two years uh it not
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
only created initially net metering um
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
for you know with the idea for early
 
01:14:50.189 --> 01:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
adopters it was very small scale at that
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
point but also tried to update this
 
01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
statute the dates I believe back to the
 
01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
70s uh that allowed a limited amount of
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
um direct producer to Consumer retail
 
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
sales or or a few um within State
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
wholesale sales um and we tried to
 
01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
update the statute but we didn't do far
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
enough so that it was actually
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
functional this bill uh and the next one
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear do try to do that
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
there were several issues raised last
 
01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
year about this bill and I I've tried to
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
reflect those in in helping
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative McGee with 407 um I could
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
run down those through real quickly um
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
there was concern by the Pu that wasn't
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
clear that the that there was a clear
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
prohibition on double dipping by
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
participating in in uh by not fully
 
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
retiring from the is New England markets
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
or participating in that metering uh
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
there was concern about paragraph um
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
three on lines 26 to 31 of the current
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
bill that prohibits reporting on
 
01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
production of Generation Um uh that some
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
found objectionable so that that um is
 
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
issue to address um I'm probably about
 
01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
out of my time here at this point um uh
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
I you know I'm happy to work with the
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee rep represented V last year
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know chair the subcommittee that was
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
working on this bill and unfortunately
 
01:16:12.629 --> 01:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
didn't move forward uh uh at that time
 
01:16:14.669 --> 01:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
uh but but I think it's a really
 
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
worthwhile compliment uh to what we're
 
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do by harnessing the power
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
comp competitive markets and create a uh
 
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
alternative uh for these gener
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
alternative to net metering 30 seconds
 
01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
I'll stop there thank you okay thank you
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh one quick question did you um work
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor of HB 407 in
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
crafting that
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
Bill yes I did and I will also confess
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
to being the person who originated the
 
01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
language in this bill it was actually
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
part of a Senate Bill 13 introduced two
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
years ago that I suggested as a market
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
based alternative to expanding net
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
metering okay excellent any additional
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
Bel see none I will call on our next
 
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
speaker who is Donna gamar from ever
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
U have good morning can you hear me yes
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
we can hear you and you have three
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you okay I will be very
 
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
brief um since I'm not an expert on
 
01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
federal jurisdiction on energy
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
transactions that require the use of
 
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
transmission system but we understand
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill we understand
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
the desire for instate generators to
 
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
undertake a bilateral contract within
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
the state for the output of their power
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
it makes perfect sense to us this type
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
of contract can take place uh currently
 
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
without the involvement of FK or ISO New
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
England if the two parties are merely a
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
ected by the distribution system of
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
course with puc oversight if however the
 
01:18:01.229 --> 01:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
two parties need the transmission system
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh to finalize the transaction according
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
to firk they must undertake the
 
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
processes required by those Regulators
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended to override the FK
 
01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
or ISO oversight which again we
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
understand um but this legislature can't
 
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
overrule FK and ISO requirements so um
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
we do believe that there could be ways
 
01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
that the parties can at opportunities to
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
update the RS RSA 362a as Mr Belo
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned it hasn't been updated in 20
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
years we think that there could be
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities that um currently to
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
update but also having an eye for the
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
future how it could be updated um I
 
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to add also that a transaction
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
like this can take place regardless of
 
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
whether um it's a distribution or a
 
01:18:48.629 --> 01:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
transmission impact if it is a financial
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
Arrangement only the issue arises when
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
the trade is an energy product so um I
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say we recognize what you
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
want what the uh sponsor is trying to do
 
01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:01.639 align:start position:0%
we think it makes perfect sense and uh
 
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
we'd be willing to offer our experts
 
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
within eversource to join with whatever
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholders you deem necessary to try
 
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
to find a way to reach the goal and make
 
01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
legitimate changes to existing laws to
 
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
make it happen and that's the end of my
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you a minute 44 seconds
 
01:19:18.239 --> 01:19:19.470 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you a minute 44 seconds
well

01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
done okay are there any questions
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative has a
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh chair thank you
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um is it correct
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
to paraphrase what you just said Mr M
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
that as written this bill is not ready
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
for prime time uh that's how I would
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
word it correct thank you for
 
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
that uh representative McGee has
 
01:19:46.629 --> 01:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you Mr
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Miss kamash for
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question you said that the
 
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
financial Arrangement uh the Financial
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
aspect of an arrangement was already
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
allowed could you elaborate on that a
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
little more so I could understand so the
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
I I wish that I could have our experts
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
here with you today to do a better job
 
01:20:06.669 --> 01:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
but uh my understanding is if it's if
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
these are Renewables there's a way
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
through um renewable energy certificates
 
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
and other types of things like that that
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
you can create this financial
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
Arrangement but again I would love to
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
double check that with our experts
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair follow up yeah and the
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
one aspect of your testimony was you
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
said that this bill would override the
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
iso New England could you explain that
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
well because um the there is a
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
distinction between um this type of an
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
arrangement if it if it's touched by the
 
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
transmission system that is if the two
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
parties are far enough away that it
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
naturally requires the use of a a
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
utilities transmission system to to Pro
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that the power goes from one
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
to the other once once you hit that
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
transmission system it automatically
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh requires the oversight that Federal
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
oversight is it distribution or
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
transmission transmission you can do it
 
01:21:00.239 --> 01:21:01.629 align:start position:0%
transmission transmission you can do it
with

01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:01.639 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
distribution so there's a difference
 
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
between the two and we but but we have
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
seen in the past where uh there have
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
been entities wanting to undertake this
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
but it did have a transmission impact
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
and those entities ended up withdrawing
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
their petition before the Pu because of
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
it so that's why we're saying if you put
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
a few PE you know the smart people in
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
the room uh all the different
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders maybe there's a way to come
 
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
up with an alternative so that that that
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
can take place going
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
forward thank
 
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
youcome thank you seeing uh no more
 
01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:36.669 align:start position:0%
youcome thank you seeing uh no more
questions

01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
for Ms gash oh representative oxenham
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
has a question you
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
recognized actually I'd like to to
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
address it to the prime sponsor it comes
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
out of Representative Thomas's uh
 
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
earlier question is the prime sponsor
 
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:53.790 align:start position:0%
earlier question is the prime sponsor
still

01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
available I believe he is I'm still here
 
01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.990 align:start position:0%
available I believe he is I'm still here
sir

01:21:58.990 --> 01:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
sir
 
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
excellent yeah so back when we had this
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
bill last year we all decided it wasn't
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time so we sent it to
 
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
interim study at interim study we all
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
said Bill looks good but you know needs
 
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
work because of covid we weren't Poss it
 
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't possible for us to do the work we
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
sent it back to the sponsors and I
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
actually signed on with the notion that
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
there was going to be substantial work
 
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
and we were going to come forward with a
 
01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
an updated and improved version so when
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
when it became clear that we have the
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
same bill again I I have to ask what
 
01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
happened why why has the bill come back
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
in its original
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
form uh I'll allow the uh question
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
because I forgot to acknowledge before
 
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
you asked it representative oxam that as
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor you shouldn't be asking
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
questions but I'll allow representative
 
01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
Lang to
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
answer again I'm not sure I can answer
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
that question I can tell you that this
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
bill was brought forward again at the
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
behest of the governor's office um to
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
allow the introduction of this bill and
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
to allow work to be done on this bill
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
because they believe that this is an
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
important part of the state's energy
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
policy okay thank you very much see no
 
01:23:22.159 --> 01:23:23.110 align:start position:0%
policy okay thank you very much see no
further

01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
questions from any members of the
 
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
committee either in the committee room
 
01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.629 align:start position:0%

online I will note that we had 115
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
people supporting this legislation and
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
two people
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
opposed and I will officially now close
 
01:23:42.669 --> 01:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on
 
01:23:42.679 --> 01:23:44.510 align:start position:0%

396 just wanted to know which one of
 
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
them would come up first because you you

we never
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
job don't hesitate to asker you don't
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
have to write point is you know you
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to it speaks I just I just
 
01:24:58.109 --> 01:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
write them in favor I don't really write
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.280 --> 01:30:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
know

01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
with uh as many executive sessions as we
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
can squeeze in between now and 11:00
 
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
and I should have remembered and I AP
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
apologize representative oxen I should
 
01:30:58.270 --> 01:30:58.280 align:start position:0%
have remembered that the one we're going
 
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
to start with is the one that we
 
01:31:04.990 --> 01:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
recessed last week which is House Bill
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
351 so I would like to uh
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
reconvene the executive session on House
 
01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.950 align:start position:0%
reconvene the executive session on House
Bill

01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
351 and recognize a representative
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
Thomas for a
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
motion chair I had some thoughts to go
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
back to review my notes and I confirmed
 
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
what I thought originally so my
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
motion1 is to
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
OT representative grey is recognized I
 
01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
second it has been moved and seconded
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
that we judge HB 315 351 rather to be
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
ought to pass is there any discussion
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative ssuch is
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
recognized yeah thank you Mr chairman
 
01:31:58.830 --> 01:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
and um well I think this bill is not a
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
good bill we heard overwhelming
 
01:32:05.709 --> 01:32:05.719 align:start position:0%
testimony including from the consumer
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh that this bill is um would
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
harm our program for Energy Efficiency
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
would harm a lot of programs but it
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
would basically uh sty me what we use
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
the systems benefits chars for four and
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
um even the utilities uh two of the
 
01:32:29.109 --> 01:32:29.119 align:start position:0%
three utilities testify against this
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh the blue sheet was
 
01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly opposed to this bill so I
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
think this is not a good bill and I
 
01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
think we should uh not agree to OTP it
 
01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:41.550 align:start position:0%
think we should uh not agree to OTP it
thank

01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative MC
 
01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.189 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative MC
recognized

01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
comment yes thank you Mr chairman I I
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
think it might have been my
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
protestations on the last Auto pass that
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
had you guys reconsider whether you
 
01:32:59.229 --> 01:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to go through with the vote that
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
day my concern is in Reading rereading
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
the testimony in preparation for today's
 
01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
potential executive session um I I think
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
the the purpose as given for the bill is
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
to support savings to rate payers and I
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
think this bill could do the opposite
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
from the testimony that we've seen so my
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
question is how do we find it beneficial
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
to ort of pull the rug out from under
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
the the the way this pricing which was
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
delicately put in place to
 
01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
support uh our Energy Efficiency uh
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
programs and the plan that's pending
 
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
right now at the Pu how does it benefit
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
us to put all that time and effort into
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
creating a plan of a way forward that
 
01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees to that stakeholder
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
process and us coming in and just
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
undoing it all I I don't I don't I I
 
01:33:52.830 --> 01:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
feel like that's a waste of money and
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
time and effort so I'm trying to figure
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
out what the intent of the bill is in
 
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
terms of uh economic benefit it I think
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
there's been no evidence that it would
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
have economic benefit I guess that's the
 
01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
easy way to say what I'm trying to say
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
and so I don't think it's a good bill
 
01:34:09.239 --> 01:34:10.830 align:start position:0%
and so I don't think it's a good bill
either

01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:34:13.229 --> 01:34:13.239 align:start position:0%
obviously the chair recognizes
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah thank you
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh can you hear
 
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
me yes okay just wanted to make sure
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
first of all the the intent of this bill
 
01:34:24.669 --> 01:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
is not to save rate payers money uh
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh it does nothing to reduce
 
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
the system benefit charge or the amount
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
of money collected on it it simply says
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
that the uh money should be spent on
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
energy low-income customers and Energy
 
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs whose main purpose
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
is to reduce the consumption of
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
electricity and that's the way it was
 
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
originally done and back a few years ago
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
the utilities came and said boy we're
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
having trouble spending all the money so
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
we want to go into thermal projects and
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
I think I was a commissioner at the time
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
I think I made a mistake I didn't
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
realize the extent it was the transfer
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
was going to be from actual Savings of
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
reduction of electric use to Thermal
 
01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
projects and if you look back and I'm
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the figures now that we uh
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire saves program
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
these are a estimate just approximate
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
but 60% of the money was spent on
 
01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
thermal projects to save 14% of the
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours so 60% of the money saved
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
14% of the kilowatt hours where 40% of
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
the money saved 86% of the kilowatt hour
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
reduction and the purpose of the system
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
benefit charge is to reduce the the use
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
of of electricity so that there is some
 
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
type of savings for everybody now every
 
01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
every time you all kilowatt hours aren't
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
equal because if you save money at 2:00
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
in the morning uh you're not reducing uh
 
01:35:46.590 --> 01:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of electricity to anybody but
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
except for the person saving it but if
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
you do it at 3:00 in the afternoon on a
 
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
on a hot summer day that's when the uh
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
cost benefit curve really jumps or the
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
cost load curve goes way way up but
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of that the purpose is to
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
transfer the money to where it does the
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
most good to benefit the system which is
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
like I said 86% of the savings was from
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
40 40% of the cost and the other part
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
was to restore to the legislators the
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
authority to raise a low of the system
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
benefit charge nothing prevents anyone
 
01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
from doing a study like it's been done
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
prevents someone coming the Pu coming to
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature and saying for the
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
following reasons here's our report we
 
01:36:28.990 --> 01:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
think you should raise or lower the
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
system benefit charge all it does is
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
reserve the ultimate Authority where it
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
belongs to the legislature so again it
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't reduce uh costs it simply
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
transfers the money to the places where
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
hours okay thank you representative
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
Harrington representative oxam is recogn
 
01:36:54.109 --> 01:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you very much uh
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
first and foremost what we have to do in
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
order to save money is reduce our Peak
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
demand all of our neighboring states are
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
reducing their Peak demand they have
 
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
aggressive ambitious renewable energy
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
and Energy Efficiency measures in Bean
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
they are they've already plateaued and
 
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
reduced their total electricity demand
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
not New Hampshire
 
01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
we have not invested the money and we
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
have not been able to bring our Peak
 
01:37:30.669 --> 01:37:30.679 align:start position:0%
demand not our total and not our Peak
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
and the issue here is that this this
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill if it were to pass would actually
 
01:37:40.350 --> 01:37:40.360 align:start position:0%
increase costs to rate payers
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
because we will have to pay an increased
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
share of the regional transmission
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
charges all the other states are going
 
01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
down we are going up and I I checked
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
with Dees and they say that um if you
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
just look at the next several years ISO
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
is projecting an additional and a half
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in increased
 
01:38:05.709 --> 01:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
transmission charges okay everybody else
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
is paying less we will have to pay more
 
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
in our our P our usage used to be
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
99.5% that was our share of the regional
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
total we're projected to be up at
 
01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
10.8% by
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
2029 every one tenth of
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
1% that our share goes up is well over a
 
01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars in increased
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
charges if we're going
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
8% no it's a whole percent plus three
 
01:38:46.239 --> 01:38:47.750 align:start position:0%
8% no it's a whole percent plus three
1.3%

01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
1.3%
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
increase each tenth of a percent is
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars this is this is the
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
cost to New Hampshire rate payers of not
 
01:39:01.589 --> 01:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
putting in the maximum amount of energy
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
efficiency we can ring from the system
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
every single expert that's come and
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
testified before this committee has told
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
us Energy Efficiency is the greatest
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
bang for the buck you invest a dollar
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
you get four times that back in savings
 
01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
reducing our Peak we've been told by ISO
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
we've been told by Dees the OCA you name
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
them this is where we save
 
01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
money and yet you want to eliminate it
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
flabbergasted representative
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
Ox uh we may have to start imposing uh
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
time limits on these comments oh I must
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
protest this is a travesty we have no
 
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
discussions we do not work on our bills
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
we do not thrash things out because it's
 
01:39:58.109 --> 01:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
time limit time limit of order I I I
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
demand the Corum and this and and
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
request to speak and not interrupt the
 
01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:03.790 align:start position:0%
request to speak and not interrupt the
chair

01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
agreed representative penel has
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak uh thank you Mr
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
chairman I I actually agree with uh
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington that we need
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
to transfer the money to where it does
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
the most good and right now where it's
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
going to do the most good
 
01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
is in uh insulation projects uh that
 
01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
sort of thing uh the utilities have
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
already changed enough light bulbs most
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
most of our gains there we've already
 
01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
gotten we're looking for new places to
 
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
spend our Energy Efficiency money uh we
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
are rif with projects that really need
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
to be uh dealt with to get lowincome
 
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.470 align:start position:0%
to be uh dealt with to get lowincome
peoples

01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
peoples
 
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
General energy needs down this is
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
something the utilities companies the
 
01:40:59.709 --> 01:40:59.719 align:start position:0%
smaller utility companies want and asked
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
for this is in opposition to to their
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
wishes as well as the wishes of the
 
01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
wishes as well as the wishes of the
general

01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
public um I can't see that passing this
 
01:41:17.229 --> 01:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
bill makes any sense at all thank you
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
okay representative uh man is recognized
 
01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
comment thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
um first of all where would we get this
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
this uh idea that somehow all we're
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
trying to do is save electricity money
 
01:41:38.189 --> 01:41:38.199 align:start position:0%
um the uh homeowner or the building
 
01:41:41.070 --> 01:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
owner or the building user saves if he
 
01:41:42.990 --> 01:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
saves money on heating oil or saves
 
01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:46.719 align:start position:0%
money on gas uh through Energy
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency uh they will also save
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
electricity for one thing and they also
 
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
have more money to their to easily pay
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
the electric rate so in in effect that
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
you're benefiting the user by doing the
 
01:42:01.629 --> 01:42:01.639 align:start position:0%
maximum Energy Efficiency you can it's
 
01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
also true that we've I've done several
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
projects in my own town and electricity
 
01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
tracks heating oil if you look at uh
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
utilization of electricity and heating
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
oil week to week they track each other
 
01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
and so by reducing the um the heat the
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
heat loss through the building you
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the electricity consumption as
 
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
well as the oil I don't think there's
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
any law that says you're not supposed to
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
also accidentally uh not on purpose um
 
01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
save oil expenses uh just because you're
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
aiming at
 
01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:39.790 align:start position:0%
aiming at
electric

01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
electric
 
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
expenses uh anyway um one of our
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
buildings uh we reduced
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
the um heating cost by 55% which is sub
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
stantial this is a stone building with
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
leaky windows we did nothing to the
 
01:42:59.310 --> 01:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
windows we simply did an indication uh
 
01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:00.629 align:start position:0%
windows we simply did an indication uh
insulation

01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
insulation
 
01:43:04.350 --> 01:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
work um and it's amazing what you can
 
01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:07.639 align:start position:0%
get done with Energy Efficiency
 
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
so again we're not just trying to save
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
electricity we're trying to save money
 
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
as well representative man
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%

com
 
01:43:24.669 --> 01:43:24.679 align:start position:0%
I just want to make a comment that my
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
objection to the bill is that it goes in
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
the hands of the
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
legislature know the saying the wheels
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
of the Gods grind slowly the legislators
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
grind almost
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
nil thank
 
01:43:42.030 --> 01:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative partial is recognized for
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
comment yes uh I've I've been watching
 
01:43:51.070 --> 01:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
as all here for the events in Texas 10
 
01:43:54.189 --> 01:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
years ago advice was at that time was to
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
winterize their grid and they failed to
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
do so and I see this is a our wakeup
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
call do the same here uh Energy
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
Efficiency this makes sense and that's
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
really all I have to say thank
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
recogniz thank you Mr chairman I just
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
want to talk to you a little bit about
 
01:44:23.070 --> 01:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
my previous uh job I uh work worked in
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
the hbac industry I did systems designs
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm not sure if you're aware of
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
it but uh uh air
 
01:44:38.350 --> 01:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
um heat pumps are are a big thing in the
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
industry right now um and so we've had
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
many people saying that they want to put
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
um heat pumps in their house first thing
 
01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
they do is they bring bring their their
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
blueprints to me or whatever we look at
 
01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
the heat loads in the house and lo and
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
behold we get to a situation where uh we
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
find out this house isn't insulated and
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
basically what we tell them in order to
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
go to uh to to gain the most amount of
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
money it's not by switching to a heat
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
pump but it's by insulating your house
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
and it is only until after they can
 
01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
insulate their house that it makes sense
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
to go to um an air source heat pump
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
so indirectly insulating houses are
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
working us towards Energy Efficiency
 
01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:39.390 align:start position:0%
working us towards Energy Efficiency
using

01:45:39.390 --> 01:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
using
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
electricity so that's a good point
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
representative pel thank you
 
01:45:46.669 --> 01:45:46.679 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi is
 
01:45:50.589 --> 01:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
recognized yes I just want to uh
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
reiterate what uh representative
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
Arrington has said Thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:45:57.870 --> 01:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
for please uh speak more loudly thank
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you chairman boss for uh for
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
acknowledging this um this bill deals or
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
this subject matter is systems benefit
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
charges systems benefit is the
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
electrical system not the not the uh
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
insulation systems or whatever for
 
01:46:21.589 --> 01:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
people's homes and so the focus of of
 
01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:25.639 align:start position:0%
the Monies to be utilized here should be
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
for dealing with saving
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
electricity not for other insulation
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
programs not that those aren't a bad
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
thing they may be but that should be
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
under a specific program designed to
 
01:46:43.229 --> 01:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
focus on that subject matter we are we
 
01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:45.719 align:start position:0%
are dealing with the premise of a
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
systems benefit charge which is for
 
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.390 align:start position:0%
systems benefit charge which is for
saving

01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
saving
 
01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:52.270 align:start position:0%
saving
electricity

01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative McGee is
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
acknowledged for our comments thank you
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I guess that seemed what
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh what representative Bernardi just
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
said I guess is that the Crux of the
 
01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
discussion that we're having the debate
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
that we're having the language that was
 
01:47:15.149 --> 01:47:15.159 align:start position:0%
in uh the original Provisions here from
 
01:47:17.589 --> 01:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
line seven starting with the word such
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
say such benefits as approved by
 
01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
Regulators May
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
include but not necessarily be limited
 
01:47:25.589 --> 01:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
to which representative Harrington's
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
Bill strikes programs for low income
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency uh customers or
 
01:47:34.109 --> 01:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
low-income customers Energy Efficiency
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
programs and then the bolded language is
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
whose main purpose is to reduce
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
consumption of electricity and not some
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
other form of energy that's added
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
language that's not what the system
 
01:47:46.589 --> 01:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
benefit charge was originally and in
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
statute designed to do that is what
 
01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's Bill does to
 
01:47:52.750 --> 01:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
to the language and the statute and so
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
what it does is it narrow casts our
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
ability to actually derive the savings
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
that were indicated by having a system
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
benefits charge and to representative
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
oam's Point earlier what that does is it
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
removes our ability to save people money
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
over time because this is a this is a
 
01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
collective way to be able to to uh
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
invest in lowering how much of the
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
transmission charge is actually
 
01:48:23.709 --> 01:48:23.719 align:start position:0%
allocated to our state so really the
 
01:48:26.830 --> 01:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
only way we can attack lowering rate
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
payers Bills or the portion that we are
 
01:48:31.589 --> 01:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
required to pay is by doing what the
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge does and if those
 
01:48:37.629 --> 01:48:37.639 align:start position:0%
funds are allowed to help us transition
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
the home heating sector uh uh to
 
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
beneficial electrification that is also
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
a desirable thing because that's another
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
place where our emissions are still high
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have a really hard
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
as well so all of those things are
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
supported by our having money available
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
through the system benefit charge to
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
help people become more efficient there
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
is no downside to this to the debate to
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
keep repeating the same points over and
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
over and over you made your point right
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
and the point is that it's not
 
01:49:13.550 --> 01:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
economical speaker uh that I will allow
 
01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
and then I'm gon to call the vote that's
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
well I sympathize with representative
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
Harrington in one way um I understand
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
that originally the idea was that this
 
01:49:33.870 --> 01:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
should be something linked to the
 
01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:34.870 align:start position:0%
should be something linked to the
electric

01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
electric
 
01:49:39.149 --> 01:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
bill and uh however I think people also
 
01:49:41.870 --> 01:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
figured out pretty quickly that that
 
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
electric bill is based on uh how much
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
energy you're using in your home of all
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
kinds whether it's electricity or or
 
01:49:54.189 --> 01:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
Heating and that is why the scope of the
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
SBC was expanded to include all forms of
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency regardless of what
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
whether it was electricity or other
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
sources and like was mentioned before
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
insulation is the number one thing you
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
start with when anytime you're trying to
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
reduce any type of energy and that
 
01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
subsequently reduces other energies the
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
funding for New Hampshire saves much as
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
that money is going to insulating homes
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
that need it desperately uh as I
 
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned I I visited her Richardson our
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
former chairman on this committee uh who
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
who lives in a trailer home and uses
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
electricity for air conditioning and
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
heating uh however it's not particularly
 
01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
well insulated so he benefits greatly
 
01:50:45.149 --> 01:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
from these kind of projects and
 
01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:47.719 align:start position:0%
incidentally our energy use electricity
 
01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
is only 30% of our energy use in total
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
we need to use everything every measure
 
01:50:56.589 --> 01:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
we can to reduce the total energy we're
 
01:50:59.470 --> 01:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
using and it benefits everybody not just
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
the electrical use thank you
 
01:51:03.709 --> 01:51:03.719 align:start position:0%

the majority report will be
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas is there a going
 
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
to be a Minority Report representative

you okay
 
01:55:38.910 --> 01:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
so with that we close the uh the exec
 
01:55:42.069 --> 01:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
session on HB 351 we don't have time to
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
start another one so we'll wait for two
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
minutes and then we'll open the public
 
01:55:47.709 --> 01:55:47.719 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:32.629 align:start position:0%

01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
written I wrote my testimony it's not
 
01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
that long but I am going to try and
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
clarify what sort of is happening with
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
this so um I focus my testimony on
 
01:59:47.069 --> 01:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify for the committee what
 
01:59:49.229 --> 01:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
it is and what it isn't so thank you
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose and distinguished
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues I come to you uh to present
 
01:59:56.189 --> 01:59:56.199 align:start position:0%
HB 407 relative to the purchase of
 
02:00:00.669 --> 02:00:00.679 align:start position:0%
output bless you of limited I'm sorry
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's okay um uh relative to the
 
02:00:05.310 --> 02:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
purchase of output of limited electrical
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
energy producers in interstate commerce
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
and including qualifying storage systems
 
02:00:12.910 --> 02:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
HB 407 started its journey in the
 
02:00:16.669 --> 02:00:16.679 align:start position:0%
legislature last session as hb1
 
02:00:18.750 --> 02:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
1262 the bill was sponsored by
 
02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative of costable and supported
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
by Governor sonunu as it moved through
 
02:00:25.350 --> 02:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
the process critics uncovered some holes
 
02:00:27.310 --> 02:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
that they thought needed to be filled
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
for the bill to meet its objectives hb1
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
1262 was sent to interim study and was
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
reviewed in August and the resulting
 
02:00:38.069 --> 02:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh appear in the bill
 
02:00:41.229 --> 02:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
you have before you today HB
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
407 uh HB 294 which was just introduced
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
by representative Lang uh earlier this
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
morning is identical in language to HB
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh 1262 from last session representative
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
Pearl and I had discussed uh merging our
 
02:01:01.069 --> 02:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
bills since HB 407 includes his bill
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
language but it adds the changes that
 
02:01:05.709 --> 02:01:05.719 align:start position:0%
had been discussed throughout the
 
02:01:06.990 --> 02:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
process last
 
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
session uh representative Pearl and I
 
02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
opted to allow both bills to come
 
02:01:13.390 --> 02:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
forward so that the house uh Tech
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
could sort it
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
out the first clarification comes in the
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
definition on line 3 section 3 of uh
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
limited production or limited electrical
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
energy producer the bolded language uh
 
02:01:29.589 --> 02:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
beginning on line four of the PDF if you
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
have it there includes a qualifying
 
02:01:35.069 --> 02:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
storage system because we know that
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
storage though held to the side as
 
02:01:40.270 --> 02:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
distinct from generation is used to
 
02:01:42.910 --> 02:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
reduce load and addresses demand and
 
02:01:45.709 --> 02:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
therefore it needs to be accounted for
 
02:01:47.790 --> 02:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
in the definition of energy
 
02:01:50.589 --> 02:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
output uh so that was one of the things
 
02:01:52.069 --> 02:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
that was missing that was identified
 
02:01:54.069 --> 02:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
during the conversation so they added
 
02:01:57.990 --> 02:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
that next I understand from former um
 
02:01:59.470 --> 02:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy Vice
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
chairman Moffett and others who were
 
02:02:04.270 --> 02:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
there for the conversations that Public
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission rate making expert
 
02:02:09.069 --> 02:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
George mclusky and representative
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
costable had had concerns that I believe
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
um I believe um Mr Belo had mentioned
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
when 294 was being being heard that per
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
Lea Lepa retailers might enjoy a type of
 
02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
double dipping if they could sell their
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
energy and also participate in net
 
02:02:32.189 --> 02:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
energy metering programs so the language
 
02:02:35.950 --> 02:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
of HB 407 expressly prohibits that
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
potential another concern addressed in
 
02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
HB 407 is that limited retail
 
02:02:44.069 --> 02:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
interestate sellers would not be able to
 
02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
drift between retail and wholesale
 
02:02:48.030 --> 02:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
markets or be counted as assets by the
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
iso New England
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
so the language you see in lines 4
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
through1 the bolded areas uh bring those
 
02:02:57.550 --> 02:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
agreed upon clarifications into the
 
02:02:59.470 --> 02:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
definition of who and what a limited
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
electric energy producer is and how they
 
02:03:04.709 --> 02:03:04.719 align:start position:0%
will participate in a retail as a Retail
 
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
Energy seller behind the
 
02:03:09.069 --> 02:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
meter the rest of the statute language
 
02:03:11.550 --> 02:03:11.560 align:start position:0%
is designed was originally designed uh
 
02:03:13.870 --> 02:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
to define the particulars of how limited
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
electric energy producers are regulated
 
02:03:17.950 --> 02:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
and accounted for because we need to
 
02:03:20.109 --> 02:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
keep current with statute language that
 
02:03:23.069 --> 02:03:23.079 align:start position:0%
includes relevant energy categories and
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
producers and that and that was the
 
02:03:27.790 --> 02:03:27.800 align:start position:0%
original bipartisan purpose of the bill
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
the last bolded section um that you'll
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
notice relates to adding language under
 
02:03:36.629 --> 02:03:36.639 align:start position:0%
the utility property tax exclusion for
 
02:03:38.589 --> 02:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
this new limited
 
02:03:42.270 --> 02:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
producer category that uh so that it is
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
consistent with the other categories
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
D so it would add that new section just
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
so that they are also included uh in
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
that in that language and and that's it
 
02:03:58.069 --> 02:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell and that's that's about as
 
02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
much as I know about what it was
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
intended to do and what the changes are
 
02:04:03.870 --> 02:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
that you have before you in this
 
02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:04.790 align:start position:0%
that you have before you in this
particular

02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm happy to take
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative McGee
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
for that excellent introduction of this
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill I have a question for
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
you I noticed that um Tom Fran from the
 
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
you see us here I may ask this question
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
of him later but I'll ask it of you
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
first and that is last year when we
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
heard this bill there was
 
02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
considerable uh concern about whether or
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
not this bill provided sufficient
 
02:04:36.910 --> 02:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
guidance to the Pu and the utilities to
 
02:04:39.310 --> 02:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
implement this program this limited
 
02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
electrical energy production program do
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
you recall that discussion and do you
 
02:04:51.669 --> 02:04:51.679 align:start position:0%
think this the changes in this bill
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
satisfy those
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you for the question uh
 
02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.870 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you for the question uh
chairman

02:04:57.870 --> 02:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
Bose it you know I wasn't privy to those
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
conversations um I am not sure I I think
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
you're right that probably um
 
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner France would be able
 
02:05:13.390 --> 02:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
to uh speak to that more directly in
 
02:05:15.390 --> 02:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
terms of the conversations that happened
 
02:05:17.229 --> 02:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
but I think that's sort of a cart before
 
02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
the horse thing here because I I believe
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
that the Public Utilities Commission
 
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
would be the correct place for those
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
conversations or stakeholder processes
 
02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
to happen in order to determine further
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
guidance I think the bill uh clarifies
 
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
and establishes that this is um
 
02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
something that we want to happen and I I
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that we should be
 
02:05:43.229 --> 02:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
providing all of those definitions so
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
maybe he can speak he's probably more
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with uh you know how this
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
process should go forward and whether
 
02:05:52.189 --> 02:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
there's anything lacking in legislation
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
that would um that would undermine the
 
02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
puc's ability to move forward in
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
regulating okay thank you I uh am not
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
going to put Mr Fran on the spot quite
 
02:06:05.549 --> 02:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
yet because we have
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
another testifier who may be may be able
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
to answer the question himself
 
02:06:14.750 --> 02:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
so the chair now recognizes
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative ssuch for a question
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you uh
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
represent mgee for taking my question
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
actually I I want to clarify I think on
 
02:06:29.470 --> 02:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
the first page on line five you talk
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
about qualified storage systems and
 
02:06:35.709 --> 02:06:35.719 align:start position:0%
qualified Cod generators but then you
 
02:06:40.510 --> 02:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
only mention as a a unit five megawatts
 
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
5 megawatts is a rating for Generation
 
02:06:46.549 --> 02:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
but it's not a rating for battery
 
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
storage if it was five megawatt hours
 
02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
that would be a battery storage capacity
 
02:06:57.549 --> 02:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
so there needs to be either a a second
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
second unit or less than something else
 
02:07:02.830 --> 02:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
or there needs to be a differentiation
 
02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
between battery storage capacity and
 
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
Generation Well I think thank you for
 
02:07:12.109 --> 02:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
your question um and I understand I take
 
02:07:16.549 --> 02:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
your point I believe and the language I
 
02:07:18.830 --> 02:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
was helped by by Clifton below the
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
language in terms of including the
 
02:07:23.149 --> 02:07:23.159 align:start position:0%
definition of storage and then adding
 
02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
the language about discharge capacity in
 
02:07:31.109 --> 02:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh in a consistent manner with uh rated
 
02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
generation so um my understanding is
 
02:07:39.229 --> 02:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
that you would want to create that uh
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
ceiling um because of the firk
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
implications of going over the 5
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
megawatt but I think he can probably
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
explain it more detailed than I can um
 
02:07:53.549 --> 02:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
I believe that that 5 megawatt ceiling
 
02:07:56.669 --> 02:07:56.679 align:start position:0%
would also relate to uh the output
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
coming from your storage capacity uh Mr
 
02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:01.470 align:start position:0%
coming from your storage capacity uh Mr
chairman

02:08:01.470 --> 02:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
followup followup uh I'd have to
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
disagree with that because whether you
 
02:08:10.510 --> 02:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
release 5 megawatts of power in one hour
 
02:08:13.229 --> 02:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
or in 10 hours makes a big difference
 
02:08:15.629 --> 02:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
it's the difference between how long
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
your battery is going to last and at
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
what voltage you want to operate it at
 
02:08:24.270 --> 02:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
so I think that five megawatts is is a a
 
02:08:27.549 --> 02:08:27.559 align:start position:0%
generating capacity uh but it's not a
 
02:08:32.910 --> 02:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
battery storage unit a measure so y i i
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
i i do point of order please
 
02:08:38.830 --> 02:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yes what's your point of order uh
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
we're debating the issue here I thought
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
we were supposed to be just uh
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
soliciting information from the
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh good point uh good point
 
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
well I was asking a question here so
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so you did uh eventually get around
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
to a question and uh I wanted to know if
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
that's a unit of battery storage or not
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
and it isn't right corre so thank you we
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
Harrington you're recognized for a
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry that was whoops that
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
was my only comment was that we didn't
 
02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
want to get into a debate oh okay thank
 
02:09:18.910 --> 02:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
you uh all right um
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions for
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative representative Bernardi
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a question thank
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh and uh thank you for
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question uh in the
 
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
negotiations that perfected this bill
 
02:09:41.589 --> 02:09:41.599 align:start position:0%
from its historical Roots uh did the
 
02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
governor's team finally sign off on that
 
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
is this version something he has looked
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
at and agre read
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
to I am not aware whether he is aware of
 
02:09:57.870 --> 02:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
the um the bill that took into
 
02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
consideration the conversations that had
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
come up along the way um when I spoke
 
02:10:04.750 --> 02:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
with representative Purl who was
 
02:10:06.270 --> 02:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
sponsoring the original Bill he had been
 
02:10:07.629 --> 02:10:07.639 align:start position:0%
asked to put the bill in because
 
02:10:09.310 --> 02:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
representative costable hadn't returned
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
to the legislature and he wasn't really
 
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with the bill so he just knew
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to bring the bill back
 
02:10:17.189 --> 02:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
so I I'm not really privy to whether or
 
02:10:20.709 --> 02:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
not the governor is aware of the level
 
02:10:22.510 --> 02:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
of detail of the conversations that went
 
02:10:25.149 --> 02:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
on and the suggested changes but I think
 
02:10:26.669 --> 02:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
if if Clifton Belo is going to be
 
02:10:28.549 --> 02:10:28.559 align:start position:0%
testifying he was privy to all that so
 
02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
he may be able to answer it for
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you uh I uh spoke to
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
a representative from the governor's
 
02:10:40.830 --> 02:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
office yesterday or the day before and
 
02:10:43.870 --> 02:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
the governor uh is neutral on this bill
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
and on the other leap bill this year he
 
02:10:50.350 --> 02:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't see either as a
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
priority all right so seeing no further
 
02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:54.430 align:start position:0%
priority all right so seeing no further
questions

02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:10:57.030 --> 02:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
for representative McGee I'd like to
 
02:11:01.229 --> 02:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
next recognize Clifton Belo who is
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
representing the city of Lebanon and Mr
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
Bel you have uh five minutes plus thank
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman members of the committee
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
um I am here in strong support of this
 
02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
bill on behalf of the city of Lebanon um
 
02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
although I began working on this issue
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
25 years ago long before I thought I'd
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
be involved in advocating for municipal
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
aggregation I think it does it would be
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
very supportive of what we would like to
 
02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
do in the city of Lebanon with Municipal
 
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
aggregation which is create options
 
02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:35.599 align:start position:0%
outside of net metering that are
 
02:11:39.069 --> 02:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
market-based that we could could use um
 
02:11:42.430 --> 02:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
a distributed generation and storage uh
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
to help serve uh customer load right
 
02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
within the city um and we potentially
 
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
have a couple project that that could do
 
02:11:55.229 --> 02:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
that um and the the to to to go right to
 
02:11:57.910 --> 02:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative some such as question the
 
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
phrase here is discharge capacity and
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
and any battery storage system any
 
02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
storage system has a rate at which they
 
02:12:08.310 --> 02:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
can U discharge or Supply whatever they
 
02:12:10.910 --> 02:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
have stored um electricity or thermal
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
energy so a maximum rated discharge
 
02:12:17.310 --> 02:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
capacity of less than 5 megawatt is is
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
the threshold that's equivalent to
 
02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
generating capacity it's not the storage
 
02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
capacity it's it's how the rate at which
 
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
power can be discharged and if it's more
 
02:12:27.229 --> 02:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
than 5 megawatts is going to have to be
 
02:12:29.549 --> 02:12:29.559 align:start position:0%
registered with ISO New England and so
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be eligible for this activity
 
02:12:33.430 --> 02:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
that that's what that's based on that
 
02:12:34.910 --> 02:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
that would be a very large battery
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
because it would probably it would have
 
02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
more than an hour's worth of storage but
 
02:12:40.990 --> 02:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
um it there are such things being
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
developed um I think as representative
 
02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
McGee said this this bill tries to
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that were re raised
 
02:12:53.069 --> 02:12:53.079 align:start position:0%
last year um it it and I don't you know
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
I can't speak for the Pu I haven't had a
 
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
chance to have discussions with them
 
02:12:58.350 --> 02:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
this about it but they there were
 
02:13:00.750 --> 02:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
concerns raised last year about
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
potential double dipping because the
 
02:13:05.950 --> 02:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
language um in the former Bill wasn't as
 
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
clear uh this tries to clear that up
 
02:13:10.669 --> 02:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
makes very explicit that you if you're
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
participating in these retail or within
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
State wholesale sales you cannot also be
 
02:13:18.549 --> 02:13:18.559 align:start position:0%
an generator an asset in the New England
 
02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
system or participating in net metering
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
so there's no double dipping um it uh
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
does clarify jurisdictional issues
 
02:13:31.229 --> 02:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
essentially the the uh Supreme Court has
 
02:13:33.069 --> 02:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
made clear as the federal power act has
 
02:13:36.109 --> 02:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
always stated that uh states that FK
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
only has jurisdiction over Interstate
 
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
sales and uh inter and transmission that
 
02:13:44.549 --> 02:13:44.559 align:start position:0%
occurs between states U the efforts to
 
02:13:46.910 --> 02:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
define those boundaries um are are
 
02:13:49.549 --> 02:13:49.559 align:start position:0%
fairly clear uh you know there is a gray
 
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
area where generators can choose one or
 
02:13:53.229 --> 02:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
the other but they shouldn't be able to
 
02:13:56.189 --> 02:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
choose both I don't believe um and so
 
02:14:01.470 --> 02:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
this reflects those uh there um are um
 
02:14:04.109 --> 02:14:04.119 align:start position:0%
there has been some con concern or
 
02:14:07.189 --> 02:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
controversy even I would say um whether
 
02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
about uh transmission charges what kind
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
of generation distributed generation or
 
02:14:13.870 --> 02:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
storage reduces the allocation of
 
02:14:17.470 --> 02:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
transmission charges and what doesn't um
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh and and
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
traditionally just to explain that a
 
02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
little bit because it's important to
 
02:14:25.709 --> 02:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
understand uh transmission which which
 
02:14:27.709 --> 02:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
only has to do with the F jurisdictional
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
high voltage system that serves the
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
interstate Market um you know there is a
 
02:14:35.589 --> 02:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
boundary there and there's nowadays
 
02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:37.599 align:start position:0%
there's a almost everywhere there's a
 
02:14:40.549 --> 02:14:40.559 align:start position:0%
wholesale meter Point uh that is at the
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
boundary between the high voltage
 
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
transmission system usually 115 KV or
 
02:14:48.030 --> 02:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
higher and uh the distribution grid
 
02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
which is usually lower than that
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
occasionally 115 but um and at that
 
02:14:56.270 --> 02:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
wholesale meter point is where the load
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
of the distribution system which is all
 
02:15:00.149 --> 02:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
retail load is behind that uh meter
 
02:15:03.629 --> 02:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
Point um that is that measurement at the
 
02:15:06.669 --> 02:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
hour of coincident Peak for each month
 
02:15:09.549 --> 02:15:09.559 align:start position:0%
is how transmission costs are allocated
 
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
the transmission uh owners have a
 
02:15:14.109 --> 02:15:14.119 align:start position:0%
revenue requirement and essentially that
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue requirement gets spread over um
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
the 12 months of the year and charge on
 
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis and it's based on a look
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
back on on the previous month's um hour
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
of coincident beak and what's measured
 
02:15:27.189 --> 02:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
at each one of those wholesale meter
 
02:15:30.109 --> 02:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
points traditionally um if you were a
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
network resource a bulk generator um
 
02:15:34.589 --> 02:15:34.599 align:start position:0%
that was happened to be connected to the
 
02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
distribution grid which there are some
 
02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
of even even 20 or 30 megawatt size
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
power plants you're considered what's
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
called a network resource or generation
 
02:15:46.270 --> 02:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
asset and you have to um register You
 
02:15:49.069 --> 02:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
Are by DEA facto um big enough that you
 
02:15:51.229 --> 02:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
considered participating in inter sale
 
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
wholesale markets um but traditionally
 
02:15:57.149 --> 02:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
distributed Generation Um and storage
 
02:15:58.910 --> 02:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
for that matter as it's developed in New
 
02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
England that's less than 5 megawatts in
 
02:16:04.430 --> 02:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
in its discharge or generating capacity
 
02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
um have not been considered and if they
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
don't register with ISO New England as a
 
02:16:10.149 --> 02:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
market participant they're not
 
02:16:11.910 --> 02:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
considered um have not been considered
 
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
bulk system uh network resources and uh
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
the load that they serve on the
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
distribution goup
 
02:16:20.709 --> 02:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
has functioned to reduce the allocation
 
02:16:22.510 --> 02:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
of transmission charges because because
 
02:16:24.910 --> 02:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
they're seen as load reducers um the
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
internal Market Market monitor at ISO
 
02:16:29.549 --> 02:16:29.559 align:start position:0%
New England raised a question last year
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh as to whether that was an appropriate
 
02:16:33.389 --> 02:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
practice uh without going into all the
 
02:16:35.790 --> 02:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
legal issues I will say that most of the
 
02:16:37.629 --> 02:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
transmission owners including eversource
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
National Grid um have come forward with
 
02:16:42.309 --> 02:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
a proposal to the transmission Committee
 
02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
of iso New England to clarify this in a
 
02:16:47.469 --> 02:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
way that would say if you're not if
 
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
you're not registered with ISO New
 
02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
England as as a generation asset Market
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
participant uh then you would function
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
as a load reducer uh which is the
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
current policy with regard to all the
 
02:17:00.030 --> 02:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
energy markets but you would also
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
function as a load reducer relative to
 
02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
the allegation uh allocation of
 
02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
transmission charges so this bill would
 
02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
give credit where credit is due uh but
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
only to the extent that there's actually
 
02:17:14.429 --> 02:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
measured um uh output onto the
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
distribution Grid at that hour of
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
coincident Peak and only if it actually
 
02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
reduces the allocation of transmission
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
charges so sort of regardless of how
 
02:17:24.669 --> 02:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
this is resolved at ISO New England uh
 
02:17:26.589 --> 02:17:26.599 align:start position:0%
this bill would work if if if it's
 
02:17:28.950 --> 02:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
determined that some of these resources
 
02:17:30.830 --> 02:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
um are subject to what's called load
 
02:17:32.669 --> 02:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
reconstitution that is the load that
 
02:17:34.429 --> 02:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
they serve at that hour quincon Peak
 
02:17:36.669 --> 02:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
gets back gets added back into that
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
wholesale meter reading to determine
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
transmission allocation then they would
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
not actually produce reduced uh
 
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
transmission cost and they would not get
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
any credit for that um so those are the
 
02:17:48.910 --> 02:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
main highlights I wanted to point out
 
02:17:52.589 --> 02:17:52.599 align:start position:0%
this this is um um you know could be a
 
02:17:54.509 --> 02:17:54.519 align:start position:0%
real market-based alternative that New
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could really set an example
 
02:17:58.270 --> 02:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
for other states that here's a way to do
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
this that doesn't involve cross
 
02:18:02.349 --> 02:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
subsidies uh there would be some benefit
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
for all distribution customers uh
 
02:18:06.270 --> 02:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
because the credit on transmission would
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
just be based on the output um at at the
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
distribution grid level and there'd be
 
02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
some savings from uh transmission uh uh
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
losses M mainly um mainly really uh the
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
Step Down Transformer from the high
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
voltage system to the low voltage where
 
02:18:23.150 --> 02:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
there's significant losses so there'd be
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
some benefit perhaps on the order of 5%
 
02:18:27.629 --> 02:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
to all distribution customers by
 
02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
reducing this allocation of transmission
 
02:18:32.150 --> 02:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
cost the bigger benefit ultimately in
 
02:18:34.030 --> 02:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
terms of providing this kind of you know
 
02:18:36.190 --> 02:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
marginal cost price signal is that he
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
gives incentives to use storage and and
 
02:18:41.230 --> 02:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
distributed generation to help shave
 
02:18:43.709 --> 02:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
those Peaks and typically move some of
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
that load off peak which which
 
02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately saves everybody money because
 
02:18:49.230 --> 02:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
we don't have to build more capacity uh
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
to serve the same number of kilowatt
 
02:18:52.429 --> 02:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
hours so we end up spreading all these
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
capacity costs over um more kilowatt
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
hours rather than few and can help bring
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
down these costs over time for everyone
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
and it's the same basis on which the Pu
 
02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599 align:start position:0%
approved battery pilot for I for Liberty
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
Utilities um it's the same sort of
 
02:19:10.469 --> 02:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
theoretical basis on which they are
 
02:19:13.309 --> 02:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
getting credit for avoided transmission
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
and capacity costs by using uh these
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
residential batteries to dispatch them
 
02:19:20.070 --> 02:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
at these expected hours of coincident
 
02:19:21.750 --> 02:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
Peak you have to you actually have to
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
dispatch them for more than the single
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
hour because you don't know which one
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's going to be so you have to try to
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
Target what you think might be the peak
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
and help shave that Peak and get credit
 
02:19:32.910 --> 02:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
for it now within Liberty Utilities
 
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure but this would open
 
02:19:38.190 --> 02:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
this up to kind of a market-based credit
 
02:19:40.349 --> 02:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
and really put most of the burden on the
 
02:19:43.230 --> 02:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
load serving entity the supplier that is
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
um For Whom the uh limited producer is a
 
02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
customer served they they they
 
02:19:49.710 --> 02:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
essentially have to be behind a retail
 
02:19:52.349 --> 02:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
meter and um they would be responsible
 
02:19:55.389 --> 02:19:55.399 align:start position:0%
for accounting for that um you know we
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
would have to work under the Pu would
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
have to you know has the full Authority
 
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
Under This to set you know oversee this
 
02:20:03.910 --> 02:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
and set up how this is going to work and
 
02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
obviously there'd be some work uh with
 
02:20:07.950 --> 02:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
the distribution utilities to make sure
 
02:20:09.790 --> 02:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
it's not burdensome on them in fact
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
there's language in here uh that that
 
02:20:14.830 --> 02:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
the commission take into account um that
 
02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
it not to avoid any uh substantial risk
 
02:20:20.429 --> 02:20:20.439 align:start position:0%
or uncompensated cost to the electric
 
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
utility in the franchise area where this
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
takes place so that that gives the
 
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
commission a lot of discretion uh to to
 
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
work with stakeholders to kind of get
 
02:20:30.670 --> 02:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
this right so thank you for your
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
attention happy to respond to any
 
02:20:34.510 --> 02:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
questions or continue to work with the
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
committee in the limited amount of time
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
to try to get this market-based approach
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh to to to help Drive Innovation and
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
harness the power uh competitive markets
 
02:20:45.790 --> 02:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
to reduce costs to rate payers all all
 
02:20:48.990 --> 02:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
around um and and sort of avoid coming
 
02:20:50.830 --> 02:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
back to the subsidy debates around that
 
02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
metering at Large Scale thank
 
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Bilo we appreciate your
 
02:20:58.870 --> 02:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
testimony I recognize representative
 
02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
samich for a question thank you Mr
 
02:21:04.510 --> 02:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr Belo for taking my
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
question uh I still have to disagree
 
02:21:10.349 --> 02:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
with you uh one megawatt in my view is
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
not a battery or discharge capacity now
 
02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
maybe if you can explain to me whether
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
there's an implo
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh rating that everything is rated for
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
one hour then I can understand that then
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
it would be 5 megawatt of energy
 
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
released in one hour but without any
 
02:21:32.110 --> 02:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
time uh Association it's that's not a
 
02:21:34.710 --> 02:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
battery storage
 
02:21:38.670 --> 02:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
unit um I believe that every battery
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
storage system if it's electrical
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
battery does in fact have have a rated
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
maximum output it can only discharge at
 
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
so many kilowatts per hour or so many
 
02:21:53.750 --> 02:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
instantaneously and so I I mean I happy
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
to work with you think you think there's
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
other words than discharge uh capacity
 
02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
but but every battery storage the
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturer says you cannot discharge
 
02:22:09.309 --> 02:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
this at a higher rate than one kilowatt
 
02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
per hour or one you know discharge rate
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
of 1 kilowatt whether that's half a
 
02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
kilowatt over half an hour or 1 kilowatt
 
02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
over an hour
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
um that's what it is and and and ISO New
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
England has generally taken the same uh
 
02:22:25.230 --> 02:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
view which is that if a battery can put
 
02:22:27.950 --> 02:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
onto the grid more than five megawatts
 
02:22:30.590 --> 02:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
instantaneously at any point in time uh
 
02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
because that's an instantaneous
 
02:22:33.950 --> 02:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
measurement the capacity to put out
 
02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
power adding the per hour is is is the
 
02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
quantity that occurs over that period of
 
02:22:40.910 --> 02:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
time but if it can put out more than
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
five megawatts instantaneously then it
 
02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be registered with them as a
 
02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
bulk um asset as a as an asset uh on the
 
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
system uh so this is just trying to
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
align that line with with the iso New
 
02:22:56.750 --> 02:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
England for jurisdictional boundary if
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's a better way to word it
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
certainly that could be
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
considered thank
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you below
 
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
recognizes P
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh Mr chairman thank
 
02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr Belo for uh
 
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
being here to answer our questions so if
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
I had a 20 Mega hour uh storage facility
 
02:23:29.790 --> 02:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
and I could only discharge 5
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
megawatts uh then I would be able to
 
02:23:34.750 --> 02:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
discharge 5
 
02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:36.429 align:start position:0%
discharge 5
megawatts

02:23:36.429 --> 02:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
for four hours is that
 
02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
correct that would be correct yes yep
 
02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:46.070 align:start position:0%
correct that would be correct yes yep
thank

02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:47.950 align:start position:0%
thank
you

02:23:47.950 --> 02:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:23:53.469 --> 02:23:53.479 align:start position:0%
okay uh see no further questions for Mr
 
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
Belo I think it's time at this point in
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
time to put Mr France on hot seat and
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
ask him to respond to a question Mr
 
02:24:07.269 --> 02:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
friends you recall from past years a
 
02:24:08.830 --> 02:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether there was
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
sufficient language in this bill to
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
allow uh it to be implemented by the puc
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
I do recall that I've looked at this
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
bill the Pu takes no position on this
 
02:24:27.389 --> 02:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
bill except to say that we are happy to
 
02:24:31.309 --> 02:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
work with Mr Belo and certainly any
 
02:24:34.670 --> 02:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
members of st&amp; if uh you believe
 
02:24:36.510 --> 02:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
additional language is needed I think Mr
 
02:24:39.870 --> 02:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
Belo did a rather admirable job of
 
02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:41.469 align:start position:0%
Belo did a rather admirable job of
describing

02:24:41.469 --> 02:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
describing
 
02:24:46.670 --> 02:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh this bill and what it does uh pretty
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
accurate accurately and how it fits into
 
02:24:50.950 --> 02:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
the iso
 
02:24:53.269 --> 02:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
markets so you have no concerns about
 
02:24:55.950 --> 02:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
it's being
 
02:24:57.790 --> 02:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
implementable I'll have to check with
 
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
our attorneys on that representative o
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm happy to get back to you
 
02:25:05.670 --> 02:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
because the issues we had were probably
 
02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
more legal than anything but I think
 
02:25:09.269 --> 02:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses a number of the
 
02:25:12.190 --> 02:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
concerns we had from last
 
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
year okay I thank you for being here and
 
02:25:19.990 --> 02:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no questions uh from
 
02:25:24.910 --> 02:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
any of the other members of the
 
02:25:28.750 --> 02:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
committee it is now
 
02:25:33.070 --> 02:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
1127 or 28 so let us close the hearing
 
02:25:36.990 --> 02:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
on HB 407 I'll announce that on the blue
 
02:25:41.469 --> 02:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
sheet we had 130 people 137 people
 
02:25:43.550 --> 02:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
signed up in support of the bill one
 
02:25:46.469 --> 02:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
person signed up in opposition to the
 
02:25:46.479 --> 02:25:48.510 align:start position:0%
person signed up in opposition to the
bill

02:25:48.510 --> 02:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
so we'll close the public hearing on HB
 
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
407 and that gives us time
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
to do a couple of more executive
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
sessions so I will now open an executive
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
session on HB is Harrington with
 
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
us is Harrington with us yes well
 
02:26:17.469 --> 02:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
he's looks like he is so
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
H executive session on HB 289 thank you
 
02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.429 align:start position:0%
H executive session on HB 289 thank you
representative

02:26:22.429 --> 02:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:26:26.030 --> 02:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
Harington and ask representative
 
02:26:31.070 --> 02:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
motion uh I move the
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh 289b ought to
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
pass thank you uh the chair recognizes
 
02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:43.550 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:45.790 align:start position:0%

Bros
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
9 thank you representative camb brose so
 
02:26:53.309 --> 02:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
we have a motion
 
02:26:58.670 --> 02:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
to render HB 289 as ought to pass that
 
02:27:00.990 --> 02:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
motion has been made and seconded is
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
there any discussion representative
 
02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington is recognized for yeah this
 
02:27:08.349 --> 02:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
is a simply a bill that allows battery
 
02:27:10.670 --> 02:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
or any type of storage for that matter
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh it's 30 megawatts or over it does two
 
02:27:15.950 --> 02:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
things it makes it if if it allows the
 
02:27:17.550 --> 02:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee to get
 
02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
involved if it's the maximum discharge
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
or instantaneous discharge is I think is
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
the the term that we're getting some
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
confusion over here I think uh Clifton
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
did it pretty well explaining that um if
 
02:27:32.830 --> 02:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
it's 30 megawatts or or above that that
 
02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
would give the SEC uh primary
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction on this the side evaluation
 
02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
committee I'm sorry I should spell say
 
02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
that out and if it's below that since
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's now become an energy facility it
 
02:27:45.269 --> 02:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
gives the towns that the the potential
 
02:27:47.550 --> 02:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
that they plan to build in the option of
 
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
petitioning the site evaluation
 
02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee and saying we don't have the
 
02:27:54.830 --> 02:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
technical or financial expertise to
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
evaluate this project and therefore we
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
would like the S evaluation committee to
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
do that and and that does a lot of
 
02:28:05.469 --> 02:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
different things it brings in a uh an
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
attorney from the uh Attorney General's
 
02:28:10.230 --> 02:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
office gets assigned to the case then to
 
02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:13.160 align:start position:0%
represent the the people it also allows
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
the town to petition the site evaluation
 
02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee to say uh we need this expert
 
02:28:21.510 --> 02:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
that uh we just don't have the $20,000
 
02:28:23.950 --> 02:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
to pay for uh and the site evaluation
 
02:28:26.990 --> 02:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
committee can award those funds from the
 
02:28:29.230 --> 02:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
um from the petitioner the person who
 
02:28:31.230 --> 02:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
wants to build it so it opens up a lot
 
02:28:34.510 --> 02:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
of resources for them and I mean as I
 
02:28:36.630 --> 02:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
think there was a case in Littleton
 
02:28:38.190 --> 02:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
where there was a proposal on this and
 
02:28:40.429 --> 02:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of confusion on uh what
 
02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
was going on in different uh trying to
 
02:28:44.510 --> 02:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
do it so it's it's simply a a way of
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
allowing the the the time PS uh to have
 
02:28:49.870 --> 02:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
more resources and also I've been
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
contacted by some people who represent
 
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh people that would potentially put in
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh large battery storage and they would
 
02:28:59.389 --> 02:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
much rather deal with the uh site
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee uh on a process
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
that they understand and know than
 
02:29:05.910 --> 02:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with a town where they really
 
02:29:07.269 --> 02:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
just don't know what's going to happen
 
02:29:09.790 --> 02:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
so it just it's we I think everybody
 
02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
wants to get more battery storage or any
 
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
type of storage because we're going to
 
02:29:17.550 --> 02:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
maximize the use of the uh interruptible
 
02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
power from solar and wind uh it really
 
02:29:24.349 --> 02:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
complement to have uh storage facilities
 
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
there thank you representative
 
02:29:28.830 --> 02:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington representative son just
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
recognize for a
 
02:29:32.990 --> 02:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
comment uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:29:34.429 --> 02:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Harrington for
 
02:29:36.870 --> 02:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill I had conversations
 
02:29:38.910 --> 02:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
with people from Littleton too when that
 
02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
battery project was proposed and I think
 
02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right they need to
 
02:29:46.269 --> 02:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
have some support from the SEC side of
 
02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
value valuation committee on projects
 
02:29:51.710 --> 02:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
like this uh so I I really uh commend
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
you for bringing this bill and um um I
 
02:29:58.710 --> 02:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
also commend you for using a 30 megawatt
 
02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:07.950 --> 02:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no uh further comments
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
well we have one representative oxum you
 
02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
com uh yes we had something of a
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
discussion on this at time of the public
 
02:30:19.790 --> 02:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
hearing but the prime sponsor wasn't uh
 
02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
available so just just to further
 
02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
clarify this issue would you agree that
 
02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
a 30 megawatt hour is approximately a
 
02:30:30.479 --> 02:30:32.070 align:start position:0%
a 30 megawatt hour is approximately a
7.5

02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
7.5
 
02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:36.110 align:start position:0%
7.5
megawatt

02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
facility to whom do you direct that
 
02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
question I thought I made it clear the
 
02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor wasn't available at the
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
time of the public hearing so it's to
 
02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
02:30:51.389 --> 02:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's me then yes sir okay
 
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh to tell you the truth I I don't know
 
02:30:56.910 --> 02:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head because uh it I
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
suppose that would differ with different
 
02:31:00.429 --> 02:31:00.439 align:start position:0%
batteries uh some batteries would be
 
02:31:03.389 --> 02:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
made to have uh the instantaneous
 
02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
discharge as rapidly as possible where
 
02:31:08.910 --> 02:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
others may be designed to have an output
 
02:31:12.269 --> 02:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
uh of a lower discharge over many more
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
hours okay could I have a followup
 
02:31:15.359 --> 02:31:17.590 align:start position:0%
hours okay could I have a followup
please

02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:31:20.710 --> 02:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me go ahead oh thank you very
 
02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
much I'm I'm disappointed that that you
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
can't give me a little bit more we we
 
02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
were trying to get a sense of how what
 
02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
the physical presence of this entity
 
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
might be because this after all is what
 
02:31:36.510 --> 02:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee is really
 
02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
about is if if you think of these as
 
02:31:42.830 --> 02:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
large containers about the size of
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
something that fits on the back of a uh
 
02:31:47.309 --> 02:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
big semi-trailer
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
could you give us a sense of how many of
 
02:31:52.469 --> 02:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
those might be stacked or placed
 
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
alongside each other on a on a
 
02:31:58.670 --> 02:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
particular lot to be producing at this
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
energy I I I simply don't know the
 
02:32:09.150 --> 02:32:09.160 align:start position:0%
answer to the question but I I can tell
 
02:32:11.469 --> 02:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
you that if you're going to store 30
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours of electricity in
 
02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
something uh you're not talking about
 
02:32:16.510 --> 02:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
something you're going to put the back
 
02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
of a pickup truck this is going to be
 
02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
very very large much larger than that
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
how how big I don't know maybe someone
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
else uh here that might uh know a little
 
02:32:26.910 --> 02:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
bit more about battery storage than me
 
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
but 30 megawatt hours is an incredible
 
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
amount of electricity so it's going to
 
02:32:34.110 --> 02:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
be big yes I was talking about
 
02:32:36.590 --> 02:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
containers on the back of a semitrailer
 
02:32:39.309 --> 02:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
not the back of a pickup it probably
 
02:32:42.030 --> 02:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
multiple ones at least definitely it's
 
02:32:43.630 --> 02:32:43.640 align:start position:0%
going to be multiple we were just trying
 
02:32:45.790 --> 02:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
to get a handle on how many is it 10 is
 
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
it 100
 
02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
I wish I wish I could help you I just
 
02:32:51.469 --> 02:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
don't know I I do think it's more in the
 
02:32:53.389 --> 02:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
range of 10 but thank you
 
02:32:55.870 --> 02:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
anyway representative Cali bitson is
 
02:32:59.389 --> 02:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
comment don't forget to
 
02:33:05.830 --> 02:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
unmute a clarifying question if I may is
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
30 megawatt hours the limit or can the
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
will the SBC get involved if we go
 
02:33:16.990 --> 02:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
higher than 30 megawatt hour
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
if if I may Mr chairman thank
 
02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
you yeah it's 30 megawatt hours of
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
grader so just so it's clear because
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
this is an important point they they
 
02:33:29.590 --> 02:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
have primary jurisdiction if it's 30
 
02:33:31.910 --> 02:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours of Greater if it's below
 
02:33:34.550 --> 02:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
that the municipality has the option of
 
02:33:36.110 --> 02:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
petitioning them and saying we don't
 
02:33:37.950 --> 02:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
have the resources to handle this please
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
help us which has happened on a number
 
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
of the smaller wind projects there was a
 
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
24 megawatt Wind project in lemster and
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
they said we don't know what to do with
 
02:33:48.309 --> 02:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
with this and it came the p and the SEC
 
02:33:51.269 --> 02:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
took jurisdiction but if it's 60 or 100
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
they would definitely have primary
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction thank
 
02:33:59.950 --> 02:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you okay see no more uh
 
02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
questions or comments I'll ask the clerk
 
02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
to call the role on the question of
 
02:34:09.790 --> 02:34:09.800 align:start position:0%

consent correct yes sir without
 
02:36:06.510 --> 02:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
objection this this bill will appear on
 
02:36:09.309 --> 02:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar so with that I'll
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:25.030 align:start position:0%

02:36:27.469 --> 02:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
okay so our next on something my bill
 
02:36:30.190 --> 02:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
went through unanimously next I would
 
02:36:32.830 --> 02:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
like a

executive session for HB
 
02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
396 Mr chair uh representative close uh
 
02:41:35.790 --> 02:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
you had a blue sheet in four opposed
 
02:41:41.710 --> 02:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
numbers last time which uh for the
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
396 oh there was a blue sheet but I have
 
02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
no idea where it
 
02:41:50.990 --> 02:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
is we were ex s we were in exec session
 
02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
not public thank you uh I I think I can
 
02:41:57.429 --> 02:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
answer that question Mr chairman I have
 
02:42:01.070 --> 02:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
a record that says we had 82 yeses on
 
02:42:03.070 --> 02:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
this and zero
 
02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
NOS okay thank you representative s
 
02:42:08.950 --> 02:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas what's the status
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
of your amendment to HB 373 there is
 
02:42:14.349 --> 02:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
they are unable to
 
02:42:19.389 --> 02:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
contact oh it's such a mess over
 
02:42:22.190 --> 02:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
there okay so OS apparently is not
 
02:42:25.150 --> 02:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
available and so we will defer an exec
 
02:42:29.790 --> 02:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
session on HB 373 until another
 
02:42:33.950 --> 02:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
time and since we have no
 
02:42:37.349 --> 02:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
other bills on the list to exec looks
 
02:42:39.469 --> 02:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
like we're going to get a bonus of 15
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
minutes on our lunch break Mr M I ask a
 
02:42:45.309 --> 02:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
question of the chair represent
 
02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
resentative Harrington you're recognized
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
for a question did we address uh HB
 
02:42:54.269 --> 02:42:54.279 align:start position:0%
225 we haven't had a public hearing on
 
02:42:57.710 --> 02:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
oh okay I thought we had okay thank you
 
02:43:00.510 --> 02:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
no problem representative Ox you had a
 
02:43:03.630 --> 02:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
question uh yes I was reviewing my notes
 
02:43:07.550 --> 02:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
on HB 172 and I don't believe we had a
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
reading of the blue sheet on that could
 
02:43:12.990 --> 02:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
I I understand you wouldn't have that at
 
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
hand but could we um ask our research
 
02:43:20.670 --> 02:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
assistant to make make that information
 
02:43:23.790 --> 02:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
available you certainly can uh Jen would
 
02:43:27.070 --> 02:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
you try to resurrect the blue sheet for
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%

02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%

far from a microphone perhaps proposed
 
04:01:13.950 --> 04:01:13.960 align:start position:0%

04:01:36.910 --> 04:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
CL seeing
 
04:01:40.110 --> 04:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
none we will now turn to the next
 
04:01:41.790 --> 04:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
speaker who has signed up to speak on
 
04:01:48.990 --> 04:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:52.750 --> 04:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
mic and uh I don't see the next speaker
 
04:01:55.349 --> 04:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
listed that would have been mayor Jim
 
04:01:59.110 --> 04:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
Donis from n nashwa but he does not
 
04:02:01.309 --> 04:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
appear to be on the list well that's
 
04:02:01.319 --> 04:02:02.870 align:start position:0%
appear to be on the list well that's
fast

04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
fast
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
so we would go to the third person on
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:14.710 --> 04:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
oh except he also does not appear to be
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:02:18.830 --> 04:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
list so we'll go to the fourth person on

list so we'll go to the fourth person on
the

me yes thank you I I'll keep this short
 
04:03:34.630 --> 04:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
also um although house spill 225
 
04:03:36.870 --> 04:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
increases the eligible net metering
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
customer generator Peak generating
 
04:03:41.309 --> 04:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
capacity of 2 megaw it dramatically and
 
04:03:43.349 --> 04:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
inappropriately undervalues the rates
 
04:03:45.790 --> 04:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
paid for this generation by the electric
 
04:03:47.670 --> 04:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
distribution utility by setting the
 
04:03:49.429 --> 04:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
rates at the equivalent of wholesale
 
04:03:52.229 --> 04:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
rates setting of neet net metering rates
 
04:03:53.630 --> 04:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
at the equivalent of wholesale rates
 
04:03:55.469 --> 04:03:55.479 align:start position:0%
fails to recognize the value of this
 
04:03:57.309 --> 04:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
generation in lowering the cost of
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
electricity for all New England excuse
 
04:04:01.149 --> 04:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
me all New Hampshire electric bill
 
04:04:03.269 --> 04:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
payers including lowering utility
 
04:04:05.950 --> 04:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
electricity demand lowering transmission
 
04:04:08.590 --> 04:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
costs lowering emissions of carbon and
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
other pollutants from fossil based
 
04:04:12.630 --> 04:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
generation uh delaying or eliminating
 
04:04:14.910 --> 04:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
costly distribution system upgrades and
 
04:04:17.349 --> 04:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
keeping precious energy dollars within
 
04:04:19.950 --> 04:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I also want to just stress
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
that um renewable energy along with
 
04:04:24.870 --> 04:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency are actually load
 
04:04:27.550 --> 04:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
reduction uh assets for the distribution
 
04:04:29.630 --> 04:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
and transmission Grid in New Hampshire
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
they're very valuable as we start to try
 
04:04:34.149 --> 04:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
to reduce those assets over time it'll
 
04:04:36.790 --> 04:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
make our grid even less resilient over
 
04:04:40.309 --> 04:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
time so I'm definitely in opposed uh to
 
04:04:44.149 --> 04:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
this legislation uh today or next year
 
04:04:45.550 --> 04:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would take
 
04:04:48.189 --> 04:04:48.199 align:start position:0%

04:05:09.469 --> 04:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
just because we have many new people on
 
04:05:12.950 --> 04:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
our committee uh could you explain to us
 
04:05:16.030 --> 04:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what that means or what the
 
04:05:19.309 --> 04:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
differences are between the energy uh
 
04:05:22.349 --> 04:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
that is being compensated or the price
 
04:05:25.030 --> 04:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's being paid for net net metered
 
04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
solar energy and if if we were to reduce
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
that the wholesale
 
04:05:34.630 --> 04:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
price I'll try to do that um I think
 
04:05:36.990 --> 04:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
that uh solar energy uh produced under
 
04:05:39.510 --> 04:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
net metering is is more akin to the
 
04:05:42.510 --> 04:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
default price of energy and I say that
 
04:05:44.189 --> 04:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
because um there have been several
 
04:05:46.510 --> 04:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
studies one done by the New Hampshire
 
04:05:48.710 --> 04:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op a number of years ago
 
04:05:51.229 --> 04:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
trying to actually ascertain the value
 
04:05:54.349 --> 04:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
of net metering electricity uh to the
 
04:05:56.269 --> 04:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
customers or excuse me the the members
 
04:05:58.710 --> 04:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
of the uh the co-op and they concluded
 
04:06:01.389 --> 04:06:01.399 align:start position:0%
that uh when you take in all the aspects
 
04:06:03.750 --> 04:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy under net metering
 
04:06:05.550 --> 04:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
including reduction in transmission
 
04:06:09.510 --> 04:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
costs um reductions in need to upgrade
 
04:06:11.110 --> 04:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh distribution facilities whether they
 
04:06:13.590 --> 04:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
be substations or or even just the wires
 
04:06:16.269 --> 04:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
distribution wires um and also some of
 
04:06:18.830 --> 04:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
the other existences of low carbon they
 
04:06:21.189 --> 04:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
thought that um it actually was around
 
04:06:23.309 --> 04:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
the price of default energy and actually
 
04:06:24.990 --> 04:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
could have even a little more value than
 
04:06:29.790 --> 04:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
that uh trying to Value uh uh net excuse
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
me net metering from solar at a
 
04:06:34.229 --> 04:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
wholesale rate is um it really
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
denigrates the value of of wholes of um
 
04:06:39.750 --> 04:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
net metering energy uh it tremendously
 
04:06:41.870 --> 04:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
undervalues it and I think it puts the
 
04:06:44.790 --> 04:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
Whole Net metering Concept in Jeopardy
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
if uh we be we end at a wholesale rate
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
for net metered
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
solar Mr chairman followup followup go
 
04:06:56.469 --> 04:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
ahead uh yes Mr Quik uh do you happen to
 
04:06:59.349 --> 04:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
know what approximately that price is
 
04:07:03.429 --> 04:07:03.439 align:start position:0%
for default versus wholesale price uh it
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
varies depending on the utility uh the
 
04:07:08.510 --> 04:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
location and but in general wholesale
 
04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
prices are R in the order of 3 to four
 
04:07:12.950 --> 04:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
cents a kilowatt hour whereas default
 
04:07:15.149 --> 04:07:15.159 align:start position:0%
rates depending on the utility can be 8
 
04:07:17.070 --> 04:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
to 10 cents per kilow
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
hour thank you thank
 
04:07:22.910 --> 04:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you seeing no more questions
 
04:07:25.469 --> 04:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
for Mr Quik we'll thank Mr kwasnik for
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
being here and I'll recognize the next
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
speaker who is Doria Brown a member of
 
04:07:33.790 --> 04:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
the public representing the city of
 
04:07:37.389 --> 04:07:37.399 align:start position:0%
NASA and do uh Miss Brown you have the
 
04:07:39.030 --> 04:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
floor for two
 
04:07:41.790 --> 04:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
minutes hi my name is Doria Brown I'm
 
04:07:43.590 --> 04:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
here from the city of Nashville as the
 
04:07:46.870 --> 04:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
energy manager in opposition to HB
 
04:07:49.710 --> 04:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
225 I oppose this bill because the
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
changing on how we calculate payments
 
04:07:54.070 --> 04:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
back for net metering would be
 
04:07:56.910 --> 04:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
detrimental to nasua as we have two
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facilities one that is in
 
04:08:03.550 --> 04:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
that net metering range where we make
 
04:08:06.990 --> 04:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
about $500,000 in Revenue being able to
 
04:08:09.630 --> 04:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
net meter with facility if we change the
 
04:08:12.070 --> 04:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
makeup of net metering we will see those
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
profits decrease significantly so would
 
04:08:18.070 --> 04:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
be a very big hit for the community we
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
also have four solar arrays two that are
 
04:08:26.429 --> 04:08:26.439 align:start position:0%
um still coming up online on our schools
 
04:08:29.349 --> 04:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
that benefit from that metering as well
 
04:08:31.950 --> 04:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
as solar arrays on our municiple
 
04:08:35.149 --> 04:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
buildings with our um fire department
 
04:08:37.950 --> 04:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
and our Transit garage which will take a
 
04:08:40.870 --> 04:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
hit as well if this bill moves forward
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
and we recalculate how we get payment
 
04:08:47.070 --> 04:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
back for net metering it's just will be
 
04:08:51.389 --> 04:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
nasua okay thank you nice job a minute
 
04:08:58.630 --> 04:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
and five seconds well done to um refresh
 
04:09:00.670 --> 04:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
everyone's memory the prime sponsor of
 
04:09:03.030 --> 04:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
the bill has requested that the bill be
 
04:09:07.030 --> 04:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
ited but we will take continue to take
 
04:09:09.710 --> 04:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
testimony from people who have signed up
 
04:09:12.870 --> 04:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
next on the list would be Clifton Belo
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
Mr Belo you have two minutes thank you
 
04:09:18.189 --> 04:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I had a little T trouble
 
04:09:19.990 --> 04:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
getting back in so I'd missed the point
 
04:09:23.070 --> 04:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
that the prime had suggested itl uh but
 
04:09:26.950 --> 04:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
just briefly um you know I concur that
 
04:09:29.550 --> 04:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
um really net meter generation should be
 
04:09:32.109 --> 04:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
treated as load reducers um when you
 
04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
look at the overall um uh default
 
04:09:36.990 --> 04:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
service rate for Liberty at least it's
 
04:09:38.990 --> 04:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
averaged around 8 cents a kilowatt hour
 
04:09:41.590 --> 04:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
over the past decade or so um about
 
04:09:46.030 --> 04:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
today about 90% of that um is what is
 
04:09:47.910 --> 04:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
paid to the supplier the load serving
 
04:09:50.590 --> 04:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
entity and the remaining 10% is a
 
04:09:53.469 --> 04:09:53.479 align:start position:0%
combination RPS compliance cost and the
 
04:09:55.030 --> 04:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
cost of the utility to administer
 
04:09:58.670 --> 04:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
default service so if it's treated as a
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
load reducer which is physically what it
 
04:10:03.109 --> 04:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
is it reduces the load at that wholesale
 
04:10:04.750 --> 04:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
meter point at the interface of
 
04:10:06.990 --> 04:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution then about
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
90% % of the cost would you know goes
 
04:10:12.990 --> 04:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
away because that is U energy that does
 
04:10:15.750 --> 04:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
not need to be procured by the supplier
 
04:10:17.269 --> 04:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
the load serving entity from the
 
04:10:19.229 --> 04:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
Interstate Wholesale Market because it's
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
being produced on the distribution grid
 
04:10:26.030 --> 04:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
um so it it you know I I concur with the
 
04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor's recommendation of itl thank
 
04:10:31.710 --> 04:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Belo any questions for
 
04:10:31.720 --> 04:10:32.469 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Belo any questions for
Mr

04:10:32.469 --> 04:10:32.479 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
Belo seeing none I'll call on the next
 
04:10:40.469 --> 04:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
speaker who is Heidi croll who is a
 
04:10:42.349 --> 04:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
lobbyist representing the granite state
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hydro Power Association miss croll you
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
have the floor for two minutes thank you
 
04:10:49.109 --> 04:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
04:10:51.389 --> 04:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone um we would
 
04:10:54.349 --> 04:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
concur with the recommendation to itl
 
04:10:55.469 --> 04:10:55.479 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
225 um the two points that I'd like to
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
make are first that uh the Pu is nearing
 
04:11:03.269 --> 04:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
the end of a very expansive process to
 
04:11:05.469 --> 04:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
study the value of distributed energy
 
04:11:07.790 --> 04:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
resources um this process began in the
 
04:11:11.309 --> 04:11:11.319 align:start position:0%
summer of 2017 following um order
 
04:11:17.630 --> 04:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
26029 in docket de1 16-5 76 um and we uh
 
04:11:19.149 --> 04:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
would encourage the committee to follow
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
should follow um should allow that
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
process to come to a completion um that
 
04:11:26.830 --> 04:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
docket was open pursuant to passage in
 
04:11:29.309 --> 04:11:29.319 align:start position:0%
2016 of House Bill
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
1116 which was relative to net metering
 
04:11:34.590 --> 04:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
and um importantly all the parties to
 
04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
that pu docket including the utilities
 
04:11:39.349 --> 04:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
cons consumer Advocates renewable um
 
04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
Advocates uh Granite State Hydro
 
04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
included um and the office of energy and
 
04:11:46.830 --> 04:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
planning all agreed um to the adoption
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
of um the the net metering tariff um
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's currently in effect um during a
 
04:11:54.670 --> 04:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
period of time uh during which data
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
would be collected pilot programs would
 
04:11:58.229 --> 04:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
be implemented and studies would be
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
conducted so um we uh agree that that
 
04:12:04.750 --> 04:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
that work should be allowed to continue
 
04:12:06.750 --> 04:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
and the settlements that were reached in
 
04:12:07.950 --> 04:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
that doc
 
04:12:10.670 --> 04:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
um should be respected um and and
 
04:12:12.630 --> 04:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
adhered to the other thing I would
 
04:12:16.830 --> 04:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
mention um is simply that um we uh gsha
 
04:12:18.349 --> 04:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
firmly believes that distributed
 
04:12:20.950 --> 04:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
generation resources um provide benefits
 
04:12:22.830 --> 04:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
well beyond the wholesale market price
 
04:12:25.510 --> 04:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
of net metered power um including
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
avoided transmission costs avoided
 
04:12:29.469 --> 04:12:29.479 align:start position:0%
capacity cost and avoided environmental
 
04:12:32.590 --> 04:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
cost um and any uh net metering credit
 
04:12:34.550 --> 04:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
set mely at the wholesale market price
 
04:12:36.630 --> 04:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
would significantly undervalue the true
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
benefits of distributed generation and
 
04:12:41.349 --> 04:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
um deny Fair compensation to the owners
 
04:12:44.070 --> 04:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
of distributed resources so with that um
 
04:12:47.149 --> 04:12:47.159 align:start position:0%

question thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh M croll for taking my
 
04:13:45.750 --> 04:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
question once again we seem to have
 
04:13:48.750 --> 04:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
missed the health benefits aspect here
 
04:13:51.070 --> 04:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
and uh with the emissions commission
 
04:13:53.630 --> 04:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
that did its work last summer I think
 
04:13:55.149 --> 04:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
for those of us who are following the
 
04:13:58.349 --> 04:13:58.359 align:start position:0%
proceedings uh were dramatic evidence
 
04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
came forward about the public health
 
04:14:03.229 --> 04:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
costs of the uh the system that we're
 
04:14:05.229 --> 04:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
currently operating under and the
 
04:14:07.389 --> 04:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
potential benefits to the health of New
 
04:14:10.670 --> 04:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents from reducing carbon
 
04:14:14.429 --> 04:14:14.439 align:start position:0%
reducing fossil fuel use etc etc do do
 
04:14:17.229 --> 04:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
you happen to have any um figures
 
04:14:19.109 --> 04:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
available to you such as those from the
 
04:14:22.269 --> 04:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
recent synapse report on the the health
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
benefits uh which should be added in on
 
04:14:28.830 --> 04:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
top of the environmental
 
04:14:31.469 --> 04:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
benefits um thank you for that question
 
04:14:34.349 --> 04:14:34.359 align:start position:0%
um representative I actually don't have
 
04:14:37.149 --> 04:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
um readily available to me right at the
 
04:14:41.109 --> 04:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
this moment um uh estimates um but I
 
04:14:45.670 --> 04:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
believe that uh estimates to what you're
 
04:14:48.910 --> 04:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
speaking about um were um brought
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
forward by at least some stakeholders in
 
04:14:54.630 --> 04:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
the docket um that I just referenced um
 
04:14:55.870 --> 04:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
so it's possible that there's
 
04:14:58.630 --> 04:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
information there um also clean energy
 
04:15:01.630 --> 04:15:01.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire may have more information
 
04:15:04.630 --> 04:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
um certainly follow up with you um or or
 
04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
to the committee um but I apologize
 
04:15:09.109 --> 04:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
don't have that data at my fingertips
 
04:15:12.149 --> 04:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
right now Mr chair can I have a followup
 
04:15:15.510 --> 04:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you very much um I
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
was an intervenor in that the docka to
 
04:15:22.109 --> 04:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
which you've referred and I also was uh
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
present and not a not did not agree to
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
the settlement uh that that you
 
04:15:30.070 --> 04:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
referenced however I I don't remember
 
04:15:31.870 --> 04:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
hardly any mention at all of health
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
benefits at that time which was why I
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
thought it was so stunning when we had
 
04:15:38.429 --> 04:15:38.439 align:start position:0%
actual experts on public health
 
04:15:41.149 --> 04:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
available at the emissions commission if
 
04:15:43.109 --> 04:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
if I could just take one more moment to
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
bring forward from the synapse report
 
04:15:47.750 --> 04:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
which was just released um in December
 
04:15:47.760 --> 04:15:48.630 align:start position:0%
which was just released um in December
of

04:15:48.630 --> 04:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:15:51.910 --> 04:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
2020 public health and avoided CO2
 
04:15:56.309 --> 04:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
benefits of local solar exceed $600
 
04:16:00.750 --> 04:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
million from 2014 to 2019 in New England
 
04:16:00.760 --> 04:16:02.469 align:start position:0%
million from 2014 to 2019 in New England
and10

04:16:02.469 --> 04:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
and10
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
million your mic's not on representative
 
04:16:08.109 --> 04:16:08.119 align:start position:0%
oxam you were recog nice to ask a
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:21.070 --> 04:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
please you I muted you you have to
 
04:16:21.080 --> 04:16:24.469 align:start position:0%
please you I muted you you have to
unmute

04:16:24.469 --> 04:16:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:27.349 --> 04:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
please it it was an apology we moved
 
04:16:29.149 --> 04:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
from an executive session the last time
 
04:16:30.550 --> 04:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
we spoke and now we're back into a
 
04:16:31.990 --> 04:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing and I was still in
 
04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
comment mode rather than asking a
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
question I apologize oh okay thank you
 
04:16:39.389 --> 04:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
for that apology uh representative McGee
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a
 
04:16:44.910 --> 04:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and I
 
04:16:46.870 --> 04:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
will try and make sure it is a question
 
04:16:49.469 --> 04:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
it is a question um for the benefit of
 
04:16:50.950 --> 04:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
the folks who are new to the committee
 
04:16:52.710 --> 04:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
Miss croll would it be possible for you
 
04:16:56.910 --> 04:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
to just describe um what the process is
 
04:16:59.189 --> 04:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
for because there are are several bills
 
04:17:01.870 --> 04:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
that have come across including this one
 
04:17:04.590 --> 04:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
um that are bouncing between where the
 
04:17:06.510 --> 04:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
authority lies for an understanding of
 
04:17:08.349 --> 04:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
how the rates get set how the rates get
 
04:17:10.469 --> 04:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
approved how the rates get moved and I
 
04:17:11.790 --> 04:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful if maybe you
 
04:17:13.030 --> 04:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
could describe to us what the
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholder process is like so that
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
people could understand um the extent to
 
04:17:20.750 --> 04:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
which the Public Utilities
 
04:17:23.429 --> 04:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
Commission uh Works to try and determine
 
04:17:26.670 --> 04:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
what the appropriate rates setting
 
04:17:29.870 --> 04:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
is um I can try I personally have not
 
04:17:31.750 --> 04:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
been representing uh the granite state
 
04:17:34.149 --> 04:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
hydrop Power Association at the public
 
04:17:37.590 --> 04:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
utility commission's docket um
 
04:17:39.710 --> 04:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
Miss Mano um who I think is probably
 
04:17:41.710 --> 04:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
going to be speaking has been intimately
 
04:17:43.630 --> 04:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
involved and she may have more
 
04:17:45.389 --> 04:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
information but I can say that in
 
04:17:48.990 --> 04:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
general um starting back with House Bill
 
04:17:52.109 --> 04:17:52.119 align:start position:0%
116 um which did um direct the Public
 
04:17:54.750 --> 04:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to open a docket to
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
look into um you know establishing
 
04:18:02.189 --> 04:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate um uh compensation for net
 
04:18:04.389 --> 04:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
metered power namely the Excess power
 
04:18:06.910 --> 04:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
that's put on to the grid um by a a
 
04:18:10.229 --> 04:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
small generator um that's not used by in
 
04:18:11.950 --> 04:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
a in a net metering or group net
 
04:18:14.349 --> 04:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
metering Arrangement and the the Pu
 
04:18:18.349 --> 04:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
under took that um task and is is did
 
04:18:21.070 --> 04:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
set up what's referred to as kind of a
 
04:18:25.309 --> 04:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
2.0 a net metering tariff 2.0 um but
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
there was a recognition I think among
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
all the parties that there would be some
 
04:18:34.109 --> 04:18:34.119 align:start position:0%
value um to having uh a a distributed
 
04:18:37.469 --> 04:18:37.479 align:start position:0%
energy uh distributed resource value
 
04:18:40.349 --> 04:18:40.359 align:start position:0%
study and that is what's underway um
 
04:18:43.149 --> 04:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
currently to get even more information
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
um there's some some pilot programs
 
04:18:49.070 --> 04:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
being run um data being collected and so
 
04:18:50.750 --> 04:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh I know that you know they're meeting
 
04:18:53.109 --> 04:18:53.119 align:start position:0%
Milestones um and I think the final
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
study is expected to be completed by
 
04:18:56.389 --> 04:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
March of
 
04:19:00.109 --> 04:19:00.119 align:start position:0%
2022 um and so you know that there's a
 
04:19:02.990 --> 04:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
lot of energy uh no pun intended a lot
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
of time and effort that's been um put
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
into uh that work at the Pu by many many
 
04:19:13.109 --> 04:19:13.119 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the Pu staff as well so
 
04:19:16.189 --> 04:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
um and it is a collaborative process um
 
04:19:18.389 --> 04:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
and uh like I said I think uh you know
 
04:19:19.870 --> 04:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll have that study
 
04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
completed by March of
 
04:19:23.790 --> 04:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
2022 thank
 
04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you m Miss croll um
 
04:19:28.710 --> 04:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions from Miss
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
croll I will call on the final speaker
 
04:19:34.389 --> 04:19:34.399 align:start position:0%

04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
who works for who represents
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Mr have the floor for two
 
04:19:44.229 --> 04:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chairman and uh we
 
04:19:45.950 --> 04:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
agree with the sponsor's recommendation
 
04:19:49.790 --> 04:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
to itl this bill um I will Echo some of
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
the things that the other folks have
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
said we agreed that the general court um
 
04:19:56.149 --> 04:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
tasked the Public Utilities Commission
 
04:19:59.910 --> 04:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
by passing House Bill 1116 in 2016 to
 
04:20:02.109 --> 04:20:02.119 align:start position:0%
look at the net metering tariff and
 
04:20:04.630 --> 04:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
credit rate in detail and they were
 
04:20:07.469 --> 04:20:07.479 align:start position:0%
specifically tasked to Ure an avoidance
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
of unjust and unreasonable cost shifting
 
04:20:12.790 --> 04:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
and to investigate the rate effects on
 
04:20:14.950 --> 04:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
all customers and the current net
 
04:20:16.910 --> 04:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
metering tariff and credit rate that we
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
have in effect now is a result of that
 
04:20:21.750 --> 04:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
detailed investigation that made sure
 
04:20:23.189 --> 04:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
that those things were taken into
 
04:20:26.830 --> 04:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
account and so we don't think it is fair
 
04:20:29.750 --> 04:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
compensation to upend that by
 
04:20:32.109 --> 04:20:32.119 align:start position:0%
legislation and to switch the credit to
 
04:20:33.870 --> 04:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
wholesale and so though we agree with
 
04:20:35.630 --> 04:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
the sponsor's recommendation itl now we
 
04:20:37.030 --> 04:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
disagree that this bill should be
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
brought back um
 
04:20:42.750 --> 04:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
again as we showed um in our synapse
 
04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
report just in energy and avoided
 
04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
capacity costs that study found that a
 
04:20:51.870 --> 04:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
distributed generation is worth at least
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
a value of 13 and a half cents per
 
04:20:55.870 --> 04:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour that's more than our
 
04:20:57.910 --> 04:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
default service rate that the larger net
 
04:21:01.309 --> 04:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
meter projects get it's um maybe closer
 
04:21:03.389 --> 04:21:03.399 align:start position:0%
to what the small net metered projects
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
get and
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
um wholesale currently is in the two to
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
three cents per kilowatt hour so it is
 
04:21:12.870 --> 04:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
very very low we agree with u miss croll
 
04:21:14.910 --> 04:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
that distributed generation has value
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
far beyond what wholesale generation
 
04:21:20.269 --> 04:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
offers and um we're also very concerned
 
04:21:23.149 --> 04:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
that this would change the rate for all
 
04:21:25.469 --> 04:21:25.479 align:start position:0%
existing projects um we feel very
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
strongly that when people and businesses
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
make investment based on existing law
 
04:21:31.269 --> 04:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have the rug pulled out
 
04:21:34.750 --> 04:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
from under them and that new changes in
 
04:21:38.109 --> 04:21:38.119 align:start position:0%
law should be only going forward and not
 
04:21:42.750 --> 04:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
change um seconds yeah not change uh the
 
04:21:45.109 --> 04:21:45.119 align:start position:0%
law under which businesses and people
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
decided to make their Investments thank
 
04:21:49.870 --> 04:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you Miss
 
04:21:49.880 --> 04:21:52.910 align:start position:0%
you thank you Miss
Mano

04:21:52.910 --> 04:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:55.630 --> 04:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
uh we have a late
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
arrival who has listed him or herself as
 
04:22:01.550 --> 04:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
nashaa mayor
 
04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
at nash.com or something like that so uh
 
04:22:09.229 --> 04:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
on the off chance that this might be uh
 
04:22:11.790 --> 04:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
mayor James donantes I would like to
 
04:22:14.309 --> 04:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
recognize him to speak before we come to
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
the end of this public hearing so I
 
04:22:19.750 --> 04:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
would ask the two of you who have your
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
hands raised if you could just hold on
 
04:22:23.189 --> 04:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
for another minute Mike could you be on
 
04:22:24.670 --> 04:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
for the next bill the next bill is a
 
04:22:27.070 --> 04:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
Nashville B at
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
130 Mr chair I'm on for both bills if
 
04:22:34.830 --> 04:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
that was a question bills okay thank you
 
04:22:38.030 --> 04:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
so Mr uh you're recognized for two
 
04:22:40.269 --> 04:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
minutes go ahead sir well thank you Mr
 
04:22:42.429 --> 04:22:42.439 align:start position:0%
chair and actually you know meline who
 
04:22:44.790 --> 04:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
just testified meline Mano used to work
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
for the city as the city's uh waterways
 
04:22:51.469 --> 04:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
manager and she was really a great
 
04:22:54.309 --> 04:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
employee we were very sorry to lose her
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
but she's obviously gone onto something
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
very valuable so my testimony here is
 
04:23:01.349 --> 04:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
very brief I mean I'm I will defer to
 
04:23:03.830 --> 04:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
meline on the the technical aspects of
 
04:23:06.670 --> 04:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
this particular bill but I'm just here
 
04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
to testify in general in support of net
 
04:23:15.149 --> 04:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
metering because I think it promotes the
 
04:23:19.510 --> 04:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh use of clean power and um then when
 
04:23:22.189 --> 04:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
we get to the next bill I will testify
 
04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
specifically about how that would affect
 
04:23:28.710 --> 04:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
our hydroelectric um our hydroelectric
 
04:23:31.269 --> 04:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
dams uh the the net metering bill you
 
04:23:35.229 --> 04:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
will have next so um I I will keep my
 
04:23:39.309 --> 04:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:42.750 --> 04:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
brief okay thank you uh Mr Mayor are
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
there any questions for mayor daas or M
 
04:23:50.269 --> 04:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
Mano uh representative ssuch you
 
04:23:51.630 --> 04:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
question yes uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:23:57.670 --> 04:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you mayor dones uh I
 
04:24:00.149 --> 04:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
actually have a question for mine mono
 
04:24:03.790 --> 04:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
but uh nice to nice to see you here Mr
 
04:24:08.149 --> 04:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
dones meline the uh can you can you say
 
04:24:11.349 --> 04:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
something about anything you know about
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
the uh mentioned before about health
 
04:24:16.910 --> 04:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
benefits that we can we can expect from
 
04:24:19.149 --> 04:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
the U more net
 
04:24:23.830 --> 04:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
metering sure um so as I mentioned we
 
04:24:26.269 --> 04:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
worked with other um similar
 
04:24:28.950 --> 04:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
organizations to uh commission this
 
04:24:30.870 --> 04:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
report from synapse energy economics
 
04:24:33.429 --> 04:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
that came out in December and it was
 
04:24:35.349 --> 04:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
mostly focused on the energy and
 
04:24:38.109 --> 04:24:38.119 align:start position:0%
capacity value of distributed generation
 
04:24:40.950 --> 04:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
but they did also look at the Val the
 
04:24:43.229 --> 04:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
public health value of avoided criteria
 
04:24:46.269 --> 04:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
pollutants as well as avoided carbon
 
04:24:48.910 --> 04:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
dioxide emissions and so they found that
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
the avoided criteria pollutants which is
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
SO2 nox and particulate matter 2.5 had a
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
value of one cent per kilowatt hour of a
 
04:25:04.469 --> 04:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
generated solar or small hydro and then
 
04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of prices
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
that different authorities have put on
 
04:25:09.670 --> 04:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
avoided carbon
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
dioxide emissions so a low value would
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
be $112
 
04:25:18.269 --> 04:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
per uh metric ton and a high value is
 
04:25:20.910 --> 04:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
$425 per metric ton and so that gives a
 
04:25:23.109 --> 04:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
range of a value of six cents per
 
04:25:26.469 --> 04:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours to 22.6 cents per
 
04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours of avoiding carbon Dio
 
04:25:32.149 --> 04:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.149 --> 04:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
emissions and that's in table three page
 
04:25:37.309 --> 04:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
seven of the synap report that I emailed
 
04:25:39.030 --> 04:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
to you all with our written testimony
 
04:25:43.109 --> 04:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
for this Bill thank very very much uh
 
04:25:46.630 --> 04:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative oxen is recognized for a
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much Mr
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
chair um I mostly my question was was
 
04:25:56.189 --> 04:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
answered in with um the help of
 
04:25:58.830 --> 04:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
Representative ssuch thank you very much
 
04:26:02.109 --> 04:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
but I was hoping that um while we have
 
04:26:05.429 --> 04:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
you here we could ask you to speak a
 
04:26:09.510 --> 04:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
little more broadly about why it is that
 
04:26:12.990 --> 04:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
we think it's worthwhile to support
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
distributed res energy resources and uh
 
04:26:20.790 --> 04:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
solar in particular um there there seems
 
04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
what used to be a widespread consensus
 
04:26:25.070 --> 04:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
that didn't need to be discussed seems
 
04:26:27.670 --> 04:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
to have come into some doubt in the the
 
04:26:30.070 --> 04:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
current uh makeup of our committee and I
 
04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
think it might be helpful if some of
 
04:26:34.830 --> 04:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
those um home truths were were
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
reiterated for for for the benefit of
 
04:26:40.109 --> 04:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
all of us sure so our organization is
 
04:26:42.670 --> 04:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
very focused I don't think that question
 
04:26:44.830 --> 04:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
is Germaine to the bill we're discussing
 
04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to uh it's absolutely
 
04:26:49.590 --> 04:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
Germain of the bill we're talking about
 
04:26:54.309 --> 04:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
the value of what solar does for
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire arguing with me I told you
 
04:26:59.469 --> 04:26:59.479 align:start position:0%
that I didn't think that question was
 
04:27:02.389 --> 04:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
Germain to the to the bill we're we're
 
04:27:04.830 --> 04:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
discussing well for the third time today
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
I protest topic but it's we're here to
 
04:27:10.229 --> 04:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
talk about this specific
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
Bill representative partial do you have
 
04:27:16.750 --> 04:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
bill I do in fact thank you so much
 
04:27:22.510 --> 04:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
this uh we had now I'm coming in as a
 
04:27:27.670 --> 04:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
newer legislator trying to educate
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
myself and I hope you can help me out
 
04:27:33.030 --> 04:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
here uh in 2016 we had a change in how
 
04:27:36.830 --> 04:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
we calculate net metering and since that
 
04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
time that's a very broad question is
 
04:27:41.070 --> 04:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
there would you see a general decrease
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
or increase in all in production of
 
04:27:47.149 --> 04:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
alternative energy such as solar and
 
04:27:49.389 --> 04:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
could you attribute to that to possibly
 
04:27:52.429 --> 04:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
the adoption of the 2016 standards as
 
04:27:54.710 --> 04:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
opposed to the earlier
 
04:27:57.269 --> 04:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
standards sure so the change that was
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
made as part of that Docket in 2016 is
 
04:28:01.590 --> 04:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
that the small net metering projects
 
04:28:04.109 --> 04:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
which are up to 100 kilowatts in
 
04:28:06.309 --> 04:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
capacity used to get what was called
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
full retail credit so pretty much any
 
04:28:11.070 --> 04:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
charge on your bill when you are export
 
04:28:12.830 --> 04:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
anything you pay for electricity when
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
you're exporting you are credited that
 
04:28:16.469 --> 04:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
same value that you pay for your
 
04:28:19.030 --> 04:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
electricity when it's imported um that
 
04:28:21.109 --> 04:28:21.119 align:start position:0%
was changed to default service the
 
04:28:23.469 --> 04:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
transmission charge and 25% of the
 
04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
distribution charge so that did lower
 
04:28:27.349 --> 04:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
the value the larger projects which are
 
04:28:28.910 --> 04:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
100 kilowatts to one
 
04:28:31.830 --> 04:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
megawatt always have got default service
 
04:28:33.309 --> 04:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
credit before and are still getting
 
04:28:35.429 --> 04:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
default service credit so the value of
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
the net in credit there has not changed
 
04:28:39.670 --> 04:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
we've also there are confounding factors
 
04:28:42.269 --> 04:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
so we've seen large variations in the
 
04:28:44.030 --> 04:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
value of renewable energy certificates
 
04:28:45.870 --> 04:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
at the same time and so it's a little
 
04:28:49.109 --> 04:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
bit difficult to say I will say that um
 
04:28:52.710 --> 04:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
there's still pretty strong adoption of
 
04:28:56.269 --> 04:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
of smaller scale solar though um
 
04:28:58.670 --> 04:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
certainly there are challenges so it's a
 
04:29:00.109 --> 04:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
little bit I don't think there was a
 
04:29:02.670 --> 04:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
significant drop off I would say
 
04:29:05.510 --> 04:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
Associated directly with that there is
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
um a lot of restriction on because the
 
04:29:11.590 --> 04:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
credit changes so significantly under
 
04:29:14.269 --> 04:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
100 kilowatts and over 100 kilowatts
 
04:29:18.070 --> 04:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
that a lot of projects will um make
 
04:29:19.710 --> 04:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
their projects smaller than they really
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
should be to serve their needs to get
 
04:29:25.109 --> 04:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
projects thank you can I ask a followup
 
04:29:31.790 --> 04:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead um what have you seen
 
04:29:33.750 --> 04:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
in other states by uh I mean I don't
 
04:29:36.389 --> 04:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
know how our current stand standards uh
 
04:29:38.670 --> 04:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
for uh reimbursement compared to other
 
04:29:40.950 --> 04:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
states in our net metering and have you
 
04:29:43.550 --> 04:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
seen any evidence in other states
 
04:29:48.030 --> 04:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
of a no slowdown compared to our what we
 
04:29:49.710 --> 04:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
say we don't know what it's rebal to but
 
04:29:52.590 --> 04:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
us but our slowdown and small energy
 
04:29:55.030 --> 04:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
production our um our net metering
 
04:29:56.990 --> 04:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
credit is very conservative compared to
 
04:29:59.870 --> 04:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
neighboring states as our our value of
 
04:30:03.429 --> 04:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates and um the
 
04:30:05.990 --> 04:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
lack of other incentives like we very
 
04:30:08.750 --> 04:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
limited Grant rebate programs so there
 
04:30:11.309 --> 04:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
is much more robust markets for
 
04:30:13.750 --> 04:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources in Vermont
 
04:30:15.950 --> 04:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts for example and Maine
 
04:30:18.670 --> 04:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
used to be similar to us and however
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
they changed a lot of regulations
 
04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
including ramping up their renewable
 
04:30:24.870 --> 04:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard increasing the value
 
04:30:26.750 --> 04:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
of credits increasing the size of
 
04:30:28.030 --> 04:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
projects that can participate in net
 
04:30:29.710 --> 04:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
metering and they are currently
 
04:30:32.309 --> 04:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
undergoing a renewable energy boom and
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
seeing a tremendous amount of investment
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
in their state while we are not thank
 
04:30:40.550 --> 04:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:42.429 --> 04:30:42.439 align:start position:0%
education okay thank you uh
 
04:30:44.990 --> 04:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative SS just recognized for a
 
04:30:47.750 --> 04:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:30:52.149 --> 04:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss moo uh um just a question
 
04:30:55.269 --> 04:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
about um you were talking prior to uh
 
04:30:57.950 --> 04:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
the differences with small solar versus
 
04:31:00.109 --> 04:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
large solar
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
um is is there a bigger impact uh from
 
04:31:07.510 --> 04:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
one or the other let's say what I'm
 
04:31:10.429 --> 04:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
getting at is uh is there benefit to
 
04:31:13.790 --> 04:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
having hundreds of small solar projects
 
04:31:17.149 --> 04:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
versus many bigger ones uh is it kind of
 
04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
a wash or or are there some systematic
 
04:31:23.590 --> 04:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
differences um in our view renewable
 
04:31:26.189 --> 04:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
generators of different scales serve
 
04:31:28.149 --> 04:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
different purposes so what we call
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
distributed Generations are those
 
04:31:32.710 --> 04:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
smaller generators that are we think of
 
04:31:34.510 --> 04:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
as 5 megawatt and less that don't
 
04:31:35.590 --> 04:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
participate in the wholesale maret
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
markets there's certainly a role to play
 
04:31:40.670 --> 04:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
for utility scale renewable projects be
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
they utility scale solar or utility
 
04:31:45.630 --> 04:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
scale Hydro or our biomass plants or
 
04:31:47.309 --> 04:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
things like that they also serve a
 
04:31:50.229 --> 04:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
purpose however distributed generation
 
04:31:52.910 --> 04:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
does have some attributes and some
 
04:31:55.790 --> 04:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
benefits that are different and that
 
04:31:58.910 --> 04:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
complement utility scale Generation Um
 
04:32:01.550 --> 04:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
such as avoiding line losses such as
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
providing resilience by having a wide
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
distributed network of generators rather
 
04:32:08.550 --> 04:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
than having one central power plant that
 
04:32:11.189 --> 04:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
if that goes down you know it's a very
 
04:32:13.109 --> 04:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
significant amount of generation that
 
04:32:14.429 --> 04:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
that goes
 
04:32:17.389 --> 04:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
down thank
 
04:32:20.750 --> 04:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative parshall
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
the next bill is about basically the
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
same subject if you'd like to wait and
 
04:32:28.030 --> 04:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
ask your question then that would be
 
04:32:29.790 --> 04:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
appreciated I think who mean
 
04:32:32.750 --> 04:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative pabel my is contract only
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
lasts a couple more years I think
 
04:32:42.850 --> 04:32:42.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:42.860 --> 04:32:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:32:43.990 --> 04:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:32:47.870 --> 04:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
that okay so uh representative
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
Harrington uh can your question wait for
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
the next bill well it's rather jine to a
 
04:32:54.070 --> 04:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
statement that was just made I just
 
04:32:56.710 --> 04:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up I'll make it very
 
04:33:00.710 --> 04:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
quick go ahead U yeah you uh thanks for
 
04:33:03.070 --> 04:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question you just stated that
 
04:33:05.551 --> 04:33:05.561 align:start position:0%
the distributed uh energy or distribut
 
04:33:07.470 --> 04:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
generation has a lot of advantages I'm
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
wondering how about the disadvantages
 
04:33:11.390 --> 04:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that distributive
 
04:33:13.830 --> 04:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
generation has no obligation to run at
 
04:33:16.109 --> 04:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
any particular time does this not bring
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
additional risks to the grid especially
 
04:33:19.949 --> 04:33:19.959 align:start position:0%
if you get large amounts of it it could
 
04:33:21.750 --> 04:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
shut on or off whenever they feel like
 
04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
it with no uh
 
04:33:26.949 --> 04:33:26.959 align:start position:0%
repercussions um the only disadvantage
 
04:33:30.310 --> 04:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
that I would say is that it doesn't
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
benefit from the economies of scale so
 
04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
it is you know more effective to build a
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
large Plant I don't think that it not
 
04:33:39.789 --> 04:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
being dispatchable is that much of a
 
04:33:41.789 --> 04:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
concern our grid operator ISU New
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
England has gotten
 
04:33:47.310 --> 04:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
extremely Adept at forecasting behind
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
the meter solar that's actually the data
 
04:33:52.349 --> 04:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
that was used by synapse to do their
 
04:33:54.670 --> 04:33:54.680 align:start position:0%
analysis for our report and so they've
 
04:33:57.109 --> 04:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
gotten quite good based on the weather
 
04:33:58.949 --> 04:33:58.959 align:start position:0%
forecast based on the factors that they
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
takeen to account to forecast day ahead
 
04:34:04.390 --> 04:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
behind the meter generation for that
 
04:34:06.990 --> 04:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
distrib for those disted resources and
 
04:34:09.830 --> 04:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
so um they don't you know they are good
 
04:34:12.429 --> 04:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
at taking that into account to be able
 
04:34:15.470 --> 04:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:17.470 --> 04:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
effectively thank you okay
 
04:34:19.310 --> 04:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative pel you might as well ask
 
04:34:22.269 --> 04:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
your question now uh thank you very much
 
04:34:25.349 --> 04:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh yes this is a question
 
04:34:30.990 --> 04:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
that's gerain to this bill and uh M Mino
 
04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
um this bill specifically looks like it
 
04:34:37.230 --> 04:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
basically basically takes a number that
 
04:34:41.230 --> 04:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
we want to the legislature to pass to
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
set the uh the the net metering rate and
 
04:34:49.230 --> 04:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
from what I understand the Pu is in the
 
04:34:52.269 --> 04:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
process of reassessing that rate could
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
you tell me what parameters the Pu will
 
04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
be looking at or is looking at to set
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
this rate
 
04:35:05.470 --> 04:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh generally that's a question what are
 
04:35:09.029 --> 04:35:09.039 align:start position:0%
they looking at sure so um my written
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
testimony mentioned the bill that was
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
passed in 2016 that started the docket
 
04:35:13.080 --> 04:35:14.551 align:start position:0%
passed in 2016 that started the docket
de1

04:35:14.551 --> 04:35:14.561 align:start position:0%
de1
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
16576 and there were specific parameters
 
04:35:19.789 --> 04:35:19.799 align:start position:0%
that the general court directed the
 
04:35:21.429 --> 04:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission to take into
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
consideration while reviewing and
 
04:35:25.869 --> 04:35:25.879 align:start position:0%
setting the net metering tariff and
 
04:35:28.830 --> 04:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
credit rate so um in my testimony I
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that included making sure
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
there was no unjust and unreasonable
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
cost shifting what the rate impact to
 
04:35:37.070 --> 04:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
all rate payer are it also looks at what
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
the fair value and credit should be to
 
04:35:42.789 --> 04:35:42.799 align:start position:0%
those uh to those distributed generators
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
there's a whole list of and so that's
 
04:35:46.709 --> 04:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
what set the credit that went into
 
04:35:47.910 --> 04:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
effect in
 
04:35:50.709 --> 04:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
2017 as part of the order in 2017
 
04:35:52.750 --> 04:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
however it was found that there was also
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
um missing information to be able to
 
04:35:57.470 --> 04:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
continue to review the net metering
 
04:35:59.230 --> 04:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
credit and so that's what Miss CR
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there was a series of
 
04:36:04.150 --> 04:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
pilots and studies that were required by
 
04:36:06.269 --> 04:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
the commission that included a
 
04:36:08.510 --> 04:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
locational value of distributed energy
 
04:36:11.551 --> 04:36:11.561 align:start position:0%
resources study that was um completed
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
this fall I believe and there's been a
 
04:36:17.230 --> 04:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
request proposal out for the value of
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources which will
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
look at a whole series of potential
 
04:36:24.590 --> 04:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
value included including avoided
 
04:36:26.990 --> 04:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
transmission cost avoided distribution
 
04:36:30.310 --> 04:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
system Investments the value of the
 
04:36:32.670 --> 04:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
energy itself the value of the avoided
 
04:36:35.070 --> 04:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
capacity all of those things that are
 
04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
are part of the study um however that
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
study hasn't started yet and so we're
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
still waiting for that study to get
 
04:36:43.990 --> 04:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
going and get completed the results of
 
04:36:47.590 --> 04:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
that study are uh intended to inform the
 
04:36:50.551 --> 04:36:50.561 align:start position:0%
next iteration of net metering tariff
 
04:36:53.390 --> 04:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
and credit rate so depending on what the
 
04:36:55.869 --> 04:36:55.879 align:start position:0%
outcome of the study is they might say
 
04:36:57.390 --> 04:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
the value is actually really close to
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
what we already have as a credit we can
 
04:37:01.670 --> 04:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
leave it as is or it might start a new
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
proceeding to say we need to review our
 
04:37:07.230 --> 04:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
net metering again taking into account
 
04:37:11.150 --> 04:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:13.349 --> 04:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
completed followup
 
04:37:17.910 --> 04:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
question follow up so uh the the the
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
rate that is being described in this
 
04:37:23.629 --> 04:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
bill do you think that comes close to
 
04:37:26.910 --> 04:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
being a fair price for net metered
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
electricity not at all the house bill
 
04:37:31.949 --> 04:37:31.959 align:start position:0%
225 wants to reset the net meering
 
04:37:34.590 --> 04:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
credit according to the monthly average
 
04:37:36.869 --> 04:37:36.879 align:start position:0%
location ational marginal price which is
 
04:37:39.230 --> 04:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
the average wholesale price in the iso
 
04:37:41.349 --> 04:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
New England Market which as I mentioned
 
04:37:43.709 --> 04:37:43.719 align:start position:0%
recently has been well recently it's
 
04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
gone up a little bit because it's been
 
04:37:47.629 --> 04:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
cold but towards the end of 2020 it was
 
04:37:49.429 --> 04:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
in the two to three cents per kilowatt
 
04:37:52.510 --> 04:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
hours which is not at all close to what
 
04:37:55.750 --> 04:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
we think the fair value of exported
 
04:37:58.590 --> 04:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
distributed generation
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
is thank you very
 
04:38:04.470 --> 04:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
much okay thank much uh representative
 
04:38:07.029 --> 04:38:07.039 align:start position:0%
McGee since the next hearing is on the
 
04:38:08.789 --> 04:38:08.799 align:start position:0%
same subject as this one could you hold
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
your question till
 
04:38:13.470 --> 04:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
then well if Miss Mano is there to
 
04:38:15.629 --> 04:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
answer it then that because that's who
 
04:38:17.670 --> 04:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
I'm it's related to what she just said
 
04:38:19.230 --> 04:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
it was a question relative to what she
 
04:38:19.240 --> 04:38:19.990 align:start position:0%
it was a question relative to what she
just

04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
covered I'm not testifying on the next
 
04:38:23.750 --> 04:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
bill if that is
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
helpful go ahead and ask your question
 
04:38:28.470 --> 04:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
then thank you Mr chair for indulging me
 
04:38:30.590 --> 04:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you Miss manow for your time
 
04:38:32.510 --> 04:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
um my question was around you mentioned
 
04:38:34.029 --> 04:38:34.039 align:start position:0%
there were pilots and studies and you
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
said that one of the things that was
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
being considered as a parameter was
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
locational value and it strikes me that
 
04:38:41.910 --> 04:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's another thing that's been a
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
concern among our committee so I wonder
 
04:38:46.189 --> 04:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
if you could say something about how
 
04:38:48.230 --> 04:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
locational value is considered because
 
04:38:50.150 --> 04:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
what I think of when I hear that
 
04:38:52.109 --> 04:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
parameter is I think that we're looking
 
04:38:56.070 --> 04:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
at places where distributed energy
 
04:38:57.990 --> 04:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
coming onto the grid would be of higher
 
04:39:00.789 --> 04:39:00.799 align:start position:0%
value than other locations because it
 
04:39:02.269 --> 04:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
would it would be useful there and there
 
04:39:03.590 --> 04:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
may be places where it's not as
 
04:39:04.949 --> 04:39:04.959 align:start position:0%
appropriate so could you just see
 
04:39:06.750 --> 04:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
something about that because I think
 
04:39:09.029 --> 04:39:09.039 align:start position:0%
it's a new subject for a lot of us yeah
 
04:39:10.869 --> 04:39:10.879 align:start position:0%
that's correct the idea of looking at
 
04:39:14.750 --> 04:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
the locational value is that if we can
 
04:39:16.269 --> 04:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
concentrate the deployment of
 
04:39:18.349 --> 04:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources in certain
 
04:39:21.869 --> 04:39:21.879 align:start position:0%
area and use those aggregated
 
04:39:25.390 --> 04:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
resources as an energy asset that can be
 
04:39:28.029 --> 04:39:28.039 align:start position:0%
used in some ways as what generally is
 
04:39:29.750 --> 04:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
called a non-wire alternative or a
 
04:39:32.709 --> 04:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
non-wire solution it can avoid a
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
significant utility investment in their
 
04:39:39.510 --> 04:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
distribution system that will be much
 
04:39:44.350 --> 04:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
more affordable so we um we advocated in
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
the last net metering docket but we're
 
04:39:47.310 --> 04:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
not successful that there should be
 
04:39:49.750 --> 04:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
locational adders so we could have a
 
04:39:52.390 --> 04:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
basic net metering credit but if the
 
04:39:55.550 --> 04:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
utilities are willing to work with us to
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
show um where in their system
 
04:40:00.670 --> 04:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources that are
 
04:40:02.750 --> 04:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
concentrated and aggregated and
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
dispatched for example have um more
 
04:40:08.990 --> 04:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
value and would allow them to avoid
 
04:40:11.708 --> 04:40:11.718 align:start position:0%
having to make a traditional investment
 
04:40:14.830 --> 04:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
in poles and wires or upgraded
 
04:40:17.590 --> 04:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
substations or things like that then
 
04:40:19.830 --> 04:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
that is a much more costeffective
 
04:40:21.868 --> 04:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
alternative for the rate payers and
 
04:40:23.550 --> 04:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
will'll save them money and so it's
 
04:40:27.030 --> 04:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
worth compensating those resources to
 
04:40:29.350 --> 04:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
focus the deployment in that area to
 
04:40:31.830 --> 04:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
provide that value to the rate payers
 
04:40:33.750 --> 04:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a mechanism to do that
 
04:40:36.830 --> 04:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
right now and so without having that
 
04:40:38.830 --> 04:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
information available or that Financial
 
04:40:40.990 --> 04:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
incentives the distributed generation
 
04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
just goes wherever it happens to go
 
04:40:46.390 --> 04:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
because that's where a resident or a
 
04:40:49.590 --> 04:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
business wants to install it and so it
 
04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
could be more beneficial and realize
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
that added value if there was that
 
04:40:55.510 --> 04:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place and that information
 
04:40:57.830 --> 04:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
sharing from the
 
04:41:01.030 --> 04:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
utilities okay thank you very much u m
 
04:41:03.708 --> 04:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
Malo M Mano being our final speaker on
 
04:41:05.030 --> 04:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm going to close CL the
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 225 and report that
 
04:41:11.550 --> 04:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
28 people signed in to support it and
 
04:41:15.910 --> 04:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
167 people signed in to oppose it uh and
 
04:41:18.270 --> 04:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
the I'll remind everybody that the prime
 
04:41:22.990 --> 04:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor requested it so now we will open
 
04:41:26.830 --> 04:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
the uh public hearing on House Bill
 
04:41:30.430 --> 04:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
148 and I will call on the prime sponsor
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill representative uh Mich
 
04:41:37.868 --> 04:41:37.878 align:start position:0%
O'Brien Senor an elected official from
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
nas to speak and introduce the bill
 
04:41:44.750 --> 04:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien you have five
 
04:41:48.270 --> 04:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chairman and vice
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
chair and the underwhelm clerk of the
 
04:41:53.590 --> 04:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee and to my fellow colleagues of
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy uh I'm
 
04:41:59.030 --> 04:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
proud to introduce this bill I represent
 
04:42:01.510 --> 04:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
nashille at District 36 uh that's
 
04:42:04.830 --> 04:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
nashille w nine in the city and I'm also
 
04:42:07.390 --> 04:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
Vice uh president on the board of
 
04:42:09.310 --> 04:42:09.320 align:start position:0%
Alderman and was a firefighter for
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
nationville for 35 years however what
 
04:42:13.788 --> 04:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
this bill does will increase the
 
04:42:16.708 --> 04:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
electric generating capacity of
 
04:42:19.510 --> 04:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal hydroelectric facilities who
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
may participate in net metering to five
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
megawatts now uh I want to basically say
 
04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
as you know of Nash and N has two rivers
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh the mighty marac and we also have our
 
04:42:36.430 --> 04:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
Nam sake River the nashille River on the
 
04:42:40.628 --> 04:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
nashille river we do own two dams uh we
 
04:42:43.670 --> 04:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
are good custodians of this these dams
 
04:42:45.708 --> 04:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
we have spent a lot of Municipal money
 
04:42:48.670 --> 04:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
on them uh such as we've replaced and
 
04:42:51.590 --> 04:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
upgraded the turbine system so that
 
04:42:54.550 --> 04:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
they're totally useful but this is not
 
04:42:56.868 --> 04:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
like I'm not asking for a shovel ready
 
04:43:00.590 --> 04:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
project these dams already exist Nash
 
04:43:03.190 --> 04:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
being in his custodial duties also tries
 
04:43:06.190 --> 04:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
to meet and we do work hard with the
 
04:43:09.628 --> 04:43:09.638 align:start position:0%
feds and making sure that all standards
 
04:43:11.948 --> 04:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
are up to grade by regulations of the
 
04:43:14.750 --> 04:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
dams and from what I hear we have very
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
happy fish in the Nashville
 
04:43:17.440 --> 04:43:19.190 align:start position:0%
happy fish in the Nashville
River

04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
River
 
04:43:24.110 --> 04:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh we uh basically want this up to net
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
metering is because nashille has the
 
04:43:29.310 --> 04:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
needs just to that you know that we do
 
04:43:31.230 --> 04:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
have a lot of municipal buildings that
 
04:43:33.670 --> 04:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
this could help us uh defray the cost to
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
our taxpayer is we have nine elementary
 
04:43:39.150 --> 04:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
schools three junior high schools two
 
04:43:41.948 --> 04:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
high schools one police station six fire
 
04:43:44.788 --> 04:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
stations City Hall a library and a host
 
04:43:47.788 --> 04:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
of other Municipal facilities now this
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
building was uh excuse me this bill was
 
04:43:53.628 --> 04:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
heard last year and perhaps maybe a uh
 
04:43:55.230 --> 04:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
uh the good gentleman representative
 
04:43:58.830 --> 04:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
hington might remember it uh it did go
 
04:44:00.430 --> 04:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
get passed by the committee
 
04:44:02.948 --> 04:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh through uh legislative
 
04:44:06.150 --> 04:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh Magic it morph into something else
 
04:44:08.190 --> 04:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
and I would like to make a request Mr
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
chairman that this bill basically stands
 
04:44:13.150 --> 04:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
alone because I think it's a good enough
 
04:44:16.628 --> 04:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
bill it uh it doesn't affect many in the
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
State uh because not many communities
 
04:44:22.948 --> 04:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
have the blessing uh that we have in
 
04:44:25.868 --> 04:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
Nash to have two already built dams in
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
the city that can that are capable
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
already and are now uh giving us
 
04:44:34.990 --> 04:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
electrical power uh but this bill will
 
04:44:36.830 --> 04:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
allow the city to become a partner with
 
04:44:38.990 --> 04:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
eversource and supplying power to the
 
04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
city and uh it would also help us in the
 
04:44:45.430 --> 04:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
increase you know like I say having two
 
04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
dams I mentioned the repair of the
 
04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
turbines that is not cheap and uh this
 
04:44:54.390 --> 04:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
would help us to uh def Fray the cost
 
04:44:58.030 --> 04:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
and uh to keep uh our city in capability
 
04:45:01.270 --> 04:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
well doing well uh as far as I'll be
 
04:45:03.150 --> 04:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
open for questions I know it's Friday
 
04:45:04.948 --> 04:45:04.958 align:start position:0%
afternoon so I know you good people want
 
04:45:08.230 --> 04:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
to get home but uh I do have technical
 
04:45:10.910 --> 04:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
experts hopefully with me uh from the
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
city we have Deb CH Chisum uh Doria
 
04:45:17.350 --> 04:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
Brown and of course our esteem here uh
 
04:45:20.230 --> 04:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
James dones uh but Mr chairman that
 
04:45:22.990 --> 04:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
concludes my opening of Mox and I'm open
 
04:45:23.000 --> 04:45:24.628 align:start position:0%
concludes my opening of Mox and I'm open
for

04:45:24.628 --> 04:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:45:27.270 --> 04:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
04:45:29.070 --> 04:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
O'Brien we appreciate you bringing this
 
04:45:32.270 --> 04:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
bill to us uh this year by the way you
 
04:45:34.948 --> 04:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
did that in 3 minutes and 30 5 Seconds
 
04:45:37.350 --> 04:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
that was excellent It's a gift sir it's
 
04:45:37.360 --> 04:45:38.708 align:start position:0%
that was excellent It's a gift sir it's
a

04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:45:41.868 --> 04:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
gift you have that gift okay
 
04:45:44.510 --> 04:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative mner is recognized for
 
04:45:46.670 --> 04:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
yes a year ago we obviously had a bunch
 
04:45:49.470 --> 04:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
of metering bills that
 
04:45:51.788 --> 04:45:51.798 align:start position:0%
um that the leadership at the time of
 
04:45:54.270 --> 04:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
our committee decided to war them all
 
04:45:57.470 --> 04:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
into uh 1218 and this was one of the
 
04:45:59.310 --> 04:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
bills that I think we all had consensus
 
04:46:02.110 --> 04:46:02.120 align:start position:0%
for the city of nashwa but um the
 
04:46:04.750 --> 04:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
committee at the time felt that that all
 
04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
should go into that one big bill so uh
 
04:46:10.990 --> 04:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
what is your question my question is um
 
04:46:12.590 --> 04:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
this was the bill was one of the bills
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
that was more felt that was question I
 
04:46:16.830 --> 04:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
was asking I believe this was one of the
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
larger yeah okay yeah and Mr chairman if
 
04:46:27.670 --> 04:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
I may say thank you for the question
 
04:46:29.628 --> 04:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
this is why I make the request of this
 
04:46:32.110 --> 04:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh please let this bill stand
 
04:46:34.910 --> 04:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
alone and judge it a according to the
 
04:46:36.868 --> 04:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
wishes of this committee I think it's
 
04:46:39.150 --> 04:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
got good strong legs and can stand up on
 
04:46:40.948 --> 04:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
its own thank
 
04:46:44.270 --> 04:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you I have a question for
 
04:46:47.070 --> 04:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
you myself could you refresh our memory
 
04:46:52.270 --> 04:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
as to how much the total U combined
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
Capac capacity is for those two
 
04:46:58.548 --> 04:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facilities in nashille uh
 
04:47:01.548 --> 04:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
we have uh I have with me uh Deb Chisum
 
04:47:03.430 --> 04:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
that will be able to get into the more
 
04:47:06.470 --> 04:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
technical expects but these are already
 
04:47:11.110 --> 04:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
existing dams uh they are old and so
 
04:47:13.150 --> 04:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
therefore they're Limited in their
 
04:47:16.750 --> 04:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
capacity to re-engineer them to get into
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
if you're fearful of them ever becoming
 
04:47:22.270 --> 04:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
a Powerhouse and becoming like
 
04:47:24.548 --> 04:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
competitive to ever Source I doubt that
 
04:47:27.230 --> 04:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
will ever happen because uh like I say
 
04:47:29.390 --> 04:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
these are old existing structures when
 
04:47:31.470 --> 04:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
we replaced the turbine it was a special
 
04:47:34.470 --> 04:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
order turbine that had to meet the diam
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
and everything of the existing uh you
 
04:47:40.590 --> 04:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
know uh Dam and everything so uh I think
 
04:47:42.190 --> 04:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
they could supplied the numbers I think
 
04:47:46.150 --> 04:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's 3 1% so a total of 4% but as you
 
04:47:48.628 --> 04:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
know any type of dam we're at the will
 
04:47:50.948 --> 04:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
of the weather such as if we have a good
 
04:47:53.150 --> 04:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
spring or anything and it's not uh
 
04:47:54.910 --> 04:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
anything in nature that would be too
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
competitive because as you know if you
 
04:47:59.310 --> 04:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
don't get the rainstorms in the summer
 
04:48:01.830 --> 04:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh drought situations uh you don't get
 
04:48:01.840 --> 04:48:03.030 align:start position:0%
uh drought situations uh you don't get
the

04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:06.030 --> 04:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
flow okay thank you we'll save those
 
04:48:08.868 --> 04:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
types of questions for more technical
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
folks uh that are lined up to speak but
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
we do have additional questions for you
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
representative yes cat McGee is
 
04:48:20.510 --> 04:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you Mr
 
04:48:22.510 --> 04:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
04:48:25.110 --> 04:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
O'Brien for taking my question um my
 
04:48:26.910 --> 04:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
question is whether you would consider
 
04:48:29.628 --> 04:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
an amendment to remove language on line
 
04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
seven that says up to and including five
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
megawatts because I think and
 
04:48:39.868 --> 04:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
including uh is problematic where furk
 
04:48:42.150 --> 04:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
Cuts you off at 5 megawatts so most of
 
04:48:44.430 --> 04:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
our bills that include below five
 
04:48:46.350 --> 04:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
megawatts they specify that and they
 
04:48:48.030 --> 04:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
don't try to include five because then
 
04:48:50.350 --> 04:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
you go over into FK
 
04:48:53.310 --> 04:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so when we were raising the
 
04:48:56.190 --> 04:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
net metering cap to 5 megawatts we were
 
04:48:58.510 --> 04:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
doing it up to 5 megawatts and not
 
04:49:01.708 --> 04:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
including so I think that that um may be
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
something technically that needs to be
 
04:49:05.150 --> 04:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
amended in the bill in order for it to
 
04:49:07.270 --> 04:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
go through uh to achieve the the
 
04:49:10.350 --> 04:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
objective that you have um uh thank you
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
for your question representative McGee
 
04:49:14.590 --> 04:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh no I wouldn't necessarily be against
 
04:49:16.830 --> 04:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
it uh what usually traditionally happens
 
04:49:19.150 --> 04:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
as you know as our history uh when I
 
04:49:21.470 --> 04:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
hand over a bill becomes the Committees
 
04:49:23.510 --> 04:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
and the committee is to do the uh the
 
04:49:25.230 --> 04:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
leg work on the bill and if you were to
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
change it to uh 10 I would be satisfied
 
04:49:32.670 --> 04:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
with that but if there's any uh you know
 
04:49:34.548 --> 04:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
if 10 was going to be the thing that was
 
04:49:36.868 --> 04:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
got to hang up on this particular bill
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
then I recommend it's a good enough Bill
 
04:49:41.708 --> 04:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
and uh we decided five but I'll take to
 
04:49:43.430 --> 04:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
10 if you want to give it to me thank
 
04:49:47.868 --> 04:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
you yeah I yeah that wasn't my point but
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
you're so adorable it's fine God bless
 
04:49:52.868 --> 04:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank
 
04:49:57.030 --> 04:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you
 
04:49:58.910 --> 04:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative representative Jackie
 
04:50:01.110 --> 04:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
Kelly pittz is recognized for a question
 
04:50:03.990 --> 04:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute I'm unmuted I
 
04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
will uh Echo Cat's last
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
statement but I I want to ask two things
 
04:50:13.350 --> 04:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
one I didn't understand what you said
 
04:50:15.270 --> 04:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by
 
04:50:18.030 --> 04:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
partnership with eversource are they
 
04:50:19.548 --> 04:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
going to pay for some of the
 
04:50:21.830 --> 04:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
construction upkeep and maintenance of
 
04:50:24.628 --> 04:50:24.638 align:start position:0%
these facilities no didn't understand
 
04:50:27.390 --> 04:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
that yeah no not at all I mean uh coming
 
04:50:29.190 --> 04:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
probably that was more speaking from my
 
04:50:30.990 --> 04:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
fire department background as you know
 
04:50:32.948 --> 04:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
traditional in the fire service we work
 
04:50:35.628 --> 04:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
as a partner with osaurus when there are
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
power situations that are down and
 
04:50:40.150 --> 04:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
everything and make sure that the public
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
is safe uh but basically this is not
 
04:50:45.910 --> 04:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
really to become like a business partner
 
04:50:48.548 --> 04:50:48.558 align:start position:0%
uh basically we are going to be uh
 
04:50:51.548 --> 04:50:51.558 align:start position:0%
because of the limits of five megawatts
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh that's not enough to run completely
 
04:50:56.270 --> 04:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
all our facilities so we'll still have
 
04:50:59.390 --> 04:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
the demand from urce so we should not be
 
04:51:01.868 --> 04:51:01.878 align:start position:0%
uh considered I probably use the wrong
 
04:51:03.990 --> 04:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
phraseology but we're definitely not to
 
04:51:05.390 --> 04:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
be a
 
04:51:09.030 --> 04:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
competitor thank you and may I follow up
 
04:51:14.110 --> 04:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
Mr the the other um question I had was
 
04:51:15.910 --> 04:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
always in the back of my mind from when
 
04:51:17.830 --> 04:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
I first got here was specific
 
04:51:20.110 --> 04:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
legislation for
 
04:51:23.868 --> 04:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
specific places or people or things do
 
04:51:28.030 --> 04:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
we do you know of any other hydro plants
 
04:51:31.708 --> 04:51:31.718 align:start position:0%
who are up to the five megawatts other
 
04:51:35.948 --> 04:51:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:38.510 --> 04:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
are in your town and any other plants or
 
04:51:41.670 --> 04:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
any other facilities that go that high
 
04:51:43.750 --> 04:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
is there anything on the marry MAAC or
 
04:51:45.150 --> 04:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for that
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
question and this is why it's basically
 
04:51:49.270 --> 04:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
like a nashille bill and I hate to use
 
04:51:51.910 --> 04:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
that term it's not that we in Nash have
 
04:51:53.590 --> 04:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
broad shoulders we think of others in
 
04:51:57.030 --> 04:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
the state as well uh but however uh not
 
04:51:59.548 --> 04:51:59.558 align:start position:0%
many communities have it and I think uh
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
my technical expert uh Deb Chism could
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
probably verify that fact uh and this is
 
04:52:07.708 --> 04:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
why this bill comes in with just nashal
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
REM mind uh because uh they're not many
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
people that have an operating Dam that
 
04:52:16.670 --> 04:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
exists right now in this state Nasha is
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
very fortunate and very unique by having
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
to and by you allowing us to increase
 
04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
this net metering uh on it uh will H
 
04:52:28.590 --> 04:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
assist us and our tax Bay is to take
 
04:52:30.910 --> 04:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
full advantage of a blessing that we
 
04:52:34.990 --> 04:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
have from our provider thank you
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh chair recognizes
 
04:52:41.910 --> 04:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative ssuch for a
 
04:52:44.350 --> 04:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:52:47.590 --> 04:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative O'Brien um as
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
someone who went to visit with a number
 
04:52:52.230 --> 04:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
of members of this committee last year
 
04:52:54.830 --> 04:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
the one of the hydroelectric facilities
 
04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
in the state um I I want wanted to ask
 
04:53:01.230 --> 04:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
you if you could say something about the
 
04:53:04.430 --> 04:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
the contribution that the uh Dam
 
04:53:08.350 --> 04:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
operators make to cleaning up our Rivers
 
04:53:10.070 --> 04:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
which is something people don't know
 
04:53:10.080 --> 04:53:10.990 align:start position:0%
which is something people don't know
much

04:53:10.990 --> 04:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:53:14.708 --> 04:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
about uh that is very true and I think
 
04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna leave that to uh uh Deb Chisum
 
04:53:21.390 --> 04:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
and to Doria Brown uh but mostly that
 
04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
probably come under de uh Chism there's
 
04:53:27.230 --> 04:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
a lot to running a dam and such as you
 
04:53:29.670 --> 04:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
bring up I says in Nal we have Happy
 
04:53:33.708 --> 04:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
Fish to my belief uh but when you have
 
04:53:36.868 --> 04:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
Dam you gotta make sure that you're not
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
affecting any of the species uh you
 
04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
don't want any type of debris getting in
 
04:53:44.510 --> 04:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to destroy your turbine so
 
04:53:47.150 --> 04:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's a uh nashille has a very good
 
04:53:49.830 --> 04:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
stewardship and if I may say so the may
 
04:53:52.510 --> 04:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
may want to jump on this as well we have
 
04:53:55.390 --> 04:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
land cleared a lot of uh overgrowth and
 
04:53:57.110 --> 04:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
everything that has been on our River if
 
04:53:59.310 --> 04:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
you haven't been down in Nash lately
 
04:54:01.788 --> 04:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
please come down uh we have cleaned that
 
04:54:04.270 --> 04:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
out we are building uh walk ways around
 
04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
the area we're going to show off our
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
namesake River nashar and we uh we
 
04:54:12.628 --> 04:54:12.638 align:start position:0%
firmly believe and it's adopted by the
 
04:54:15.430 --> 04:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
majority of citizens of Nash to be good
 
04:54:17.708 --> 04:54:17.718 align:start position:0%
stewards to a a blessing of a natural
 
04:54:21.750 --> 04:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
resource that we have in the Nash
 
04:54:25.070 --> 04:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
River thank you okay thank you seeing no
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
 
04:54:29.070 --> 04:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
O'Brian well thank you representative
 
04:54:31.510 --> 04:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
for introducing your bill and I thank
 
04:54:33.910 --> 04:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
the committee sir thank you very welcome
 
04:54:36.350 --> 04:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here I'll call on
 
04:54:38.708 --> 04:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
our next speaker who is once again the
 
04:54:42.030 --> 04:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
mayor of nsha The Honorable uh James
 
04:54:44.670 --> 04:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
Dess Mr Mayor you have the floor for
 
04:54:47.830 --> 04:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
three minutes oh well thank you again Mr
 
04:54:50.628 --> 04:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
chair uh the as you've already heard and
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
I want to thank uh representative
 
04:54:55.470 --> 04:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
O'Brien for sponsoring this bill as
 
04:54:57.270 --> 04:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
you've heard we have two hydroelectric
 
04:54:59.470 --> 04:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
dams in which we have generate we have
 
04:55:01.910 --> 04:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
invested a lot of money millions of
 
04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
dollars the in answer to one of the
 
04:55:07.190 --> 04:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
questions the one one of them called the
 
04:55:10.948 --> 04:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
Jackson Falls Dam is one megawatt
 
04:55:14.548 --> 04:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
currently net metered the other is the
 
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
MF Falls Dam further up
 
04:55:20.548 --> 04:55:20.558 align:start position:0%
River three megawatts so there would be
 
04:55:22.910 --> 04:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
certainly no problem in the language
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
that uh representative McGee suggested
 
04:55:31.390 --> 04:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
three megawatts yeah um so we we know
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
that there is a difference of opinion
 
04:55:38.270 --> 04:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
regarding the desirability of broader
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
net me metering that currently
 
04:55:45.190 --> 04:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
exists so and and the main concern of I
 
04:55:48.270 --> 04:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
think eversource and other utilities is
 
04:55:49.990 --> 04:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
that if there
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
were you know broad widespread uh 5
 
04:55:54.000 --> 04:55:56.910 align:start position:0%
were you know broad widespread uh 5
megawatt

04:55:56.910 --> 04:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:00.910 --> 04:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
commercial sites where where net metered
 
04:56:03.390 --> 04:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
electricity were generated it could
 
04:56:06.990 --> 04:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
negatively affect uh in their opinion
 
04:56:09.470 --> 04:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
electric rates in New
 
04:56:12.270 --> 04:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we propose this specific
 
04:56:16.350 --> 04:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
Bill to cover only municipally
 
04:56:20.110 --> 04:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
owned facilities so that we
 
04:56:24.750 --> 04:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
could uh not um cause any the type of
 
04:56:26.788 --> 04:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
change you know Mass change that a
 
04:56:29.230 --> 04:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
broader net metering bill would bring
 
04:56:31.830 --> 04:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
about but would help the taxpayers of
 
04:56:33.990 --> 04:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
nasro who've invested a lot of money in
 
04:56:36.868 --> 04:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
this in in these hydroelectric
 
04:56:39.830 --> 04:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
facilities uh the the um I do not
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
believe ever and I can't speak for them
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
but I've talked with them on a number of
 
04:56:45.708 --> 04:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
subjects I do not think they have a
 
04:56:47.670 --> 04:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill because it is
 
04:56:52.430 --> 04:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
specific to Municipal municipally owned
 
04:56:56.788 --> 04:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
hydro and uh again would would benefit
 
04:56:58.548 --> 04:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
the the taxpayers of the city of
 
04:57:01.310 --> 04:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
nashille who've invested so much money
 
04:57:04.230 --> 04:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
in this uh in these facilities
 
04:57:07.390 --> 04:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
so I hope that the committee oh and
 
04:57:09.390 --> 04:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
there was one question I'm sorry about
 
04:57:11.350 --> 04:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
um specific
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislation uh the idea that legislation
 
04:57:16.830 --> 04:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
might affect only one Community I
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
believe it's uh fair to say that that is
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
legal and appropriate it but it's
 
04:57:24.230 --> 04:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
usually expressed in terms of
 
04:57:26.830 --> 04:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
municipally owned in other words it it
 
04:57:29.430 --> 04:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
expresses it in a general way if some
 
04:57:32.350 --> 04:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
other community were to get a dam uh it
 
04:57:34.390 --> 04:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
would apply to them too similar to
 
04:57:36.750 --> 04:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that might say cities of
 
04:57:39.070 --> 04:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
over a 100,000 there might be a specific
 
04:57:42.590 --> 04:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
rule applying only to Manchester but uh
 
04:57:45.708 --> 04:57:45.718 align:start position:0%
still legal and proper uh so I don't I
 
04:57:47.628 --> 04:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
don't think the the fact that this might
 
04:57:49.868 --> 04:57:49.878 align:start position:0%
only affect municipally owned dams in
 
04:57:52.590 --> 04:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
Nashville would is an impairment so I
 
04:57:54.708 --> 04:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
would uh ask the committee to favorably
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
consider this help us out uh it doesn't
 
04:58:00.628 --> 04:58:00.638 align:start position:0%
um have broad implications as some net
 
04:58:03.470 --> 04:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
metering bills do I do support those as
 
04:58:05.910 --> 04:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
well but I know there's much more
 
04:58:07.628 --> 04:58:07.638 align:start position:0%
reservations about many more
 
04:58:10.510 --> 04:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
reservations about those and I think if
 
04:58:12.230 --> 04:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
you inquire of ever Source I don't think
 
04:58:14.030 --> 04:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
they have a you know any serious problem
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
with this with this
 
04:58:18.590 --> 04:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
bill and that's concludes my testimony
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you Mr Mayor we
 
04:58:23.788 --> 04:58:23.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here the chair
 
04:58:32.110 --> 04:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:32.120 --> 04:58:34.670 align:start position:0%
 
question

04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:58:36.788 --> 04:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for taking my
 
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
question thanks for my question mayor uh
 
04:58:41.910 --> 04:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
I think you almost answered it but just
 
04:58:45.628 --> 04:58:45.638 align:start position:0%
to be clear uh this are there any other
 
04:58:47.708 --> 04:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state that would
 
04:58:50.470 --> 04:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
be affected by this bill at all so how
 
04:58:53.670 --> 04:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
many I'm just curious I you know I do
 
04:58:56.548 --> 04:58:56.558 align:start position:0%
not think so um I don't think there are
 
04:58:59.548 --> 04:58:59.558 align:start position:0%
other there are other uh Municipal dams
 
04:59:02.510 --> 04:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
of more than one megawatt or that would
 
04:59:06.350 --> 04:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
be affective by this bill um that's my
 
04:59:09.910 --> 04:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh impression but maybe Deb Chisum who
 
04:59:12.868 --> 04:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
will be on could uh clarify that she's
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
our she she replaced Madam mateline Mano
 
04:59:18.910 --> 04:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
as the waterways manager Deb Chisum did
 
04:59:21.430 --> 04:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh but I think the answer is no but I
 
04:59:23.310 --> 04:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
would want to qualify that by saying
 
04:59:26.788 --> 04:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
let's make sure I'm right by asking
 
04:59:31.470 --> 04:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
Deb thank you thank you um I I would
 
04:59:34.708 --> 04:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
just note that
 
04:59:38.310 --> 04:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
Doria Brown has is online and has signed
 
04:59:41.628 --> 04:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
up to speak but I do not see the name
 
04:59:45.190 --> 04:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
Deb Chism either being here or signed up
 
04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
to speak so I just want to make that
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
well Doria may be able to answer the
 
04:59:52.390 --> 04:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
question and she is the energy manager
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
that uh we have okay thank you she
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
testifying in a little while uh
 
04:59:59.830 --> 04:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative Jackie C pittz is
 
05:00:02.310 --> 05:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question I will wait I
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
believe for the I'll wait for the energy
 
05:00:09.788 --> 05:00:09.798 align:start position:0%
manager I can't get my hand down all
 
05:00:12.510 --> 05:00:12.520 align:start position:0%

The Honorable Clifton Belo from the city

of Lebanon Mr Belo you have two minutes
 
05:00:34.110 --> 05:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
the floor is
 
05:00:36.628 --> 05:00:36.638 align:start position:0%
yours whoops wait a minute I think maybe
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
I have
 
05:00:40.628 --> 05:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
to allow you to
 
05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%

05:00:45.628 --> 05:00:45.638 align:start position:0%
have thank you Mr chairman on behalf of
 
05:00:48.910 --> 05:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon I do support U this
 
05:00:48.920 --> 05:00:50.590 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon I do support U this
legislation

05:00:50.590 --> 05:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:00:54.150 --> 05:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
um I would um concur with the thought
 
05:00:56.590 --> 05:00:56.600 align:start position:0%
that it the phrase up to an including 5
 
05:00:58.670 --> 05:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
megawatt should proba should be
 
05:01:01.750 --> 05:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
preferably changed to not uh um less
 
05:01:03.788 --> 05:01:03.798 align:start position:0%
than 5 megawatts so would say for
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
municipal Hydro electric generation
 
05:01:08.788 --> 05:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
facility less than 5 megaw it just
 
05:01:11.150 --> 05:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
happens to be that exactly at five
 
05:01:13.590 --> 05:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
megawatts it becomes a f jurisdictional
 
05:01:16.270 --> 05:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
generator and um should not qualify for
 
05:01:18.750 --> 05:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
net metering so it's that simple um and
 
05:01:21.310 --> 05:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
I just referred to my uh testimony on
 
05:01:23.868 --> 05:01:23.878 align:start position:0%

support of House Bill 148 and I'll keep
 
05:01:52.830 --> 05:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
it short um adding this provision to RSA
 
05:01:55.750 --> 05:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
361 will permit a municipal owned
 
05:01:57.948 --> 05:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facil Nashville to fully
 
05:01:59.430 --> 05:01:59.440 align:start position:0%

metering program within New Hampshire
 
05:02:03.628 --> 05:02:03.638 align:start position:0%
and enable the citizen of Nashville to

fully participate in that metering via
 
05:02:07.628 --> 05:02:07.638 align:start position:0%
their existing hydroelectric generating
 
05:02:09.788 --> 05:02:09.798 align:start position:0%
plan uh this bill will go a long way
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
towards reducing energy cost for
 
05:02:14.310 --> 05:02:14.320 align:start position:0%

afternoon uh for the record Heidi coll I
 
05:03:05.110 --> 05:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
work at Gallagher cahin and gartell and
 
05:03:06.470 --> 05:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking today on behalf of the
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
Granite State hydr Power Association um
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
05:03:13.868 --> 05:03:13.878 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 148 um GSA supports the
 
05:03:16.990 --> 05:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
goal of House Bill 148 um however we
 
05:03:18.830 --> 05:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
would respectfully suggest that if this
 
05:03:21.750 --> 05:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
committee passes House Bill 106 which
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
you heard this morning relative to
 
05:03:25.590 --> 05:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
establishing procedures for municipal
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
host customer generators um which gsha
 
05:03:31.708 --> 05:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
supports as a step forward um then House
 
05:03:34.868 --> 05:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
Bill 148 which would not be uh necessary
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
um so as you've heard a houseold 148
 
05:03:38.350 --> 05:03:38.360 align:start position:0%
would allow municipally owned
 
05:03:42.830 --> 05:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facilities up to um and
 
05:03:44.868 --> 05:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
right now written five including five
 
05:03:46.990 --> 05:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
megawatts to be eligible to participate
 
05:03:49.548 --> 05:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
in net metering um as you know currently
 
05:03:51.470 --> 05:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
the size limit on renewable facilities
 
05:03:53.470 --> 05:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
that are eligible to net meter is one
 
05:03:56.230 --> 05:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
megawatt um to the best of Granite State
 
05:03:58.150 --> 05:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh hydropower association's knowledge
 
05:04:00.270 --> 05:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
there is only one municipally owned uh
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facility um that kind of
 
05:04:04.230 --> 05:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
fits in this category and as you've
 
05:04:07.510 --> 05:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
heard this is um Mine Falls in nasua and
 
05:04:10.590 --> 05:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
therefore um really only one facility
 
05:04:12.708 --> 05:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
would meet the eligibility criteria in
 
05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 148 um MF Falls is a member
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the Granite State hydr Power
 
05:04:19.070 --> 05:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
Association and we fully support
 
05:04:21.548 --> 05:04:21.558 align:start position:0%
allowing this facility to net meter
 
05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
however um gsha believes that all of the
 
05:04:27.110 --> 05:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
state's small renewable facilities um uh
 
05:04:29.670 --> 05:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
above one megawatt and Below 5 megawatt
 
05:04:31.628 --> 05:04:31.638 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to provide um locally
 
05:04:33.628 --> 05:04:33.638 align:start position:0%
produced power to Hampshire consumers
 
05:04:34.990 --> 05:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
through net metering or group net
 
05:04:37.510 --> 05:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
metering arrangements so it is for these
 
05:04:39.430 --> 05:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
reasons that we um would respectfully
 
05:04:41.070 --> 05:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
request that this committee uh pass
 
05:04:43.750 --> 05:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
actually house bille 106 um so that all
 
05:04:45.470 --> 05:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions including the
 
05:04:47.590 --> 05:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
city of nasua will have the opportunity
 
05:04:49.350 --> 05:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
to net meter with local renewable
 
05:04:52.510 --> 05:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
facilities above one megawatt um and
 
05:04:53.868 --> 05:04:53.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and I'd be happy
 
05:04:56.430 --> 05:04:56.440 align:start position:0%

05:04:59.590 --> 05:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
questions nicely done one minute and 50
 
05:05:02.548 --> 05:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
seconds uh the chair recognized

05:05:33.470 --> 05:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
a a language has been written to that
 
05:05:35.948 --> 05:05:35.958 align:start position:0%
bill makes it less problematic to get it
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
actually passed that's my understanding
 
05:05:39.948 --> 05:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
of it can you please correct me if I am
 
05:05:42.990 --> 05:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:48.670 --> 05:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
one um I think that uh House Bill 407
 
05:05:51.030 --> 05:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
kind of comes at
 
05:05:54.150 --> 05:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
um comes at Power sales a little bit
 
05:05:57.708 --> 05:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
differently and I think um both uh
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities under the Lepa act as well
 
05:06:03.230 --> 05:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
as opportunities under net metering
 
05:06:07.868 --> 05:06:07.878 align:start position:0%
um certainly do give um consumers uh you
 
05:06:10.150 --> 05:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
know a lot of choices um and you know
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
both paths I think would be um uh
 
05:06:15.430 --> 05:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh and would certainly
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
increase um competitive options um but
 
05:06:23.750 --> 05:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh my reference was to um House Bill 106
 
05:06:25.628 --> 05:06:25.638 align:start position:0%
uh which was representative Lang's Bill
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning um which really
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
talked about uh Municipal host customer
 
05:06:32.948 --> 05:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
generators so which would be uh
 
05:06:35.230 --> 05:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
representative langsville um would be
 
05:06:38.788 --> 05:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
open to any interested um political
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
subdivision um versus houseo 148 uh as a
 
05:06:44.910 --> 05:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
practical matter limited um simply to
 
05:06:46.150 --> 05:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
the city of
 
05:06:49.628 --> 05:06:49.638 align:start position:0%
nsha thank you so
 
05:06:52.590 --> 05:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh the chair recognizes
 
05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:03.830 --> 05:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
question unmute yeah yeah thank you Mr
 
05:07:03.840 --> 05:07:05.670 align:start position:0%
question unmute yeah yeah thank you Mr
chair

05:07:05.670 --> 05:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:07:09.948 --> 05:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to know whether um if
 
05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
um Miss crl if uh if a 106 were to pass
 
05:07:20.788 --> 05:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
would that provide um other uh Hydro
 
05:07:24.230 --> 05:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
potential Hydro generators from getting
 
05:07:25.948 --> 05:07:25.958 align:start position:0%
into the business of generating more
 
05:07:28.868 --> 05:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
electricity are there potential people
 
05:07:31.270 --> 05:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
out there waiting for this opportunity
 
05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
that you know of
 
05:07:35.030 --> 05:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um so
 
05:07:37.750 --> 05:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
certainly there are um a number of
 
05:07:40.390 --> 05:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
existing small scale Hydro facilities in
 
05:07:42.868 --> 05:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that are between the size
 
05:07:45.910 --> 05:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
of one megawatt and up to five megawatts
 
05:07:49.030 --> 05:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
that are very interested in serving um
 
05:07:52.788 --> 05:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
local municipalities um schools uh
 
05:07:56.868 --> 05:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
County complexes Etc um and it in fact a
 
05:08:00.190 --> 05:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
lot of um those cons customers have
 
05:08:02.590 --> 05:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
approached um their local uh
 
05:08:05.110 --> 05:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
hydrogenerators uh asking if they could
 
05:08:07.350 --> 05:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
um create a you know an arrangement to
 
05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
purchase the power and um currently
 
05:08:11.590 --> 05:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
there's really not that option so
 
05:08:14.708 --> 05:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
certainly there's a lot of interest um
 
05:08:17.708 --> 05:08:17.718 align:start position:0%
and in addition uh well I don't have
 
05:08:20.030 --> 05:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
firsthand knowledge of it I I believe
 
05:08:22.628 --> 05:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
that there's probably one or two
 
05:08:24.830 --> 05:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
projects uh small Hydro projects out
 
05:08:26.430 --> 05:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
there between one megawatt and 5
 
05:08:29.830 --> 05:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
megawatts that um are sitting idle um
 
05:08:32.070 --> 05:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
but potentially if there's you know kind
 
05:08:33.868 --> 05:08:33.878 align:start position:0%
of of a new market made available to
 
05:08:36.948 --> 05:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
them then you might see um an owner
 
05:08:41.150 --> 05:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
invest to kind of um
 
05:08:45.150 --> 05:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
repower a small Hydro facility so um I
 
05:08:47.110 --> 05:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question but I'm
 
05:08:49.230 --> 05:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
happy to elaborate if it didn't thank
 
05:08:50.350 --> 05:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
you very
 
05:08:53.110 --> 05:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
much the chair recognizes representative
 
05:08:54.628 --> 05:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
Cali pittz for a
 
05:08:59.590 --> 05:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you Heidi um could you
 
05:09:02.270 --> 05:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
please we I hear the change the term
 
05:09:05.548 --> 05:09:05.558 align:start position:0%
terms interchangeably used here Supply
 
05:09:08.788 --> 05:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
Power at net metering my understanding
 
05:09:11.788 --> 05:09:11.798 align:start position:0%
of net metering is net metering is for
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:17.788 --> 05:09:17.798 align:start position:0%
of selling back to the grid but
 
05:09:21.150 --> 05:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
basically for the purpose of
 
05:09:24.310 --> 05:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
calculating the price or the the revenue
 
05:09:26.708 --> 05:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
that's going back
 
05:09:29.708 --> 05:09:29.718 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:09:34.830 --> 05:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
um the generator if for some reason net
 
05:09:38.430 --> 05:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
metering didn't exist the generator
 
05:09:43.590 --> 05:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
could still sell power to the
 
05:09:46.510 --> 05:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh to the to electric company or whoever
 
05:09:49.030 --> 05:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
is interested in buying is that
 
05:09:52.110 --> 05:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
correct so right now for um thank you
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
for the question representative so right
 
05:09:55.788 --> 05:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
now for the small Hydro facilities that
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
are above one megawatt or or really any
 
05:10:00.628 --> 05:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
facility not just Hydro that's above one
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
megawatt the option really the only
 
05:10:06.510 --> 05:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
option that's available for them is um
 
05:10:08.230 --> 05:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know selling into the wholesale
 
05:10:11.788 --> 05:10:11.798 align:start position:0%
market right um You I think there's you
 
05:10:13.310 --> 05:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
know there's net metering and then
 
05:10:15.070 --> 05:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
there's group net metering so net
 
05:10:16.750 --> 05:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
metering is you know I kind of think
 
05:10:19.548 --> 05:10:19.558 align:start position:0%
about it is the residential um consumer
 
05:10:22.030 --> 05:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
have maybe has solar on their roof and
 
05:10:24.150 --> 05:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
if they're producing Excess power then
 
05:10:27.310 --> 05:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
they're um exporting that to the grid
 
05:10:29.708 --> 05:10:29.718 align:start position:0%
and getting compensated for for that
 
05:10:30.948 --> 05:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
excess that they're putting onto the
 
05:10:33.788 --> 05:10:33.798 align:start position:0%
Grid in the case of group net metering
 
05:10:35.708 --> 05:10:35.718 align:start position:0%
and you heard Miss vau um I think
 
05:10:37.708 --> 05:10:37.718 align:start position:0%
testified to this uh in one of your
 
05:10:39.990 --> 05:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
earlier bills in the context of group
 
05:10:43.270 --> 05:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
net metering there's a generator um that
 
05:10:46.868 --> 05:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
creates a group with willing customers
 
05:10:49.670 --> 05:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
that that want to essentially use that
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
um that power and so it's kind of it's
 
05:10:55.750 --> 05:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
virtual net metering if you will where
 
05:11:00.190 --> 05:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
the pu's rules require that the power
 
05:11:02.990 --> 05:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
being generated by the generator in this
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
case let's say a small Hydro facility
 
05:11:07.830 --> 05:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
that the consumers in that group that
 
05:11:10.750 --> 05:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
their demand for power has to meet or
 
05:11:13.590 --> 05:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
exceed right the expected output of the
 
05:11:16.430 --> 05:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
generator so in the case specifically
 
05:11:18.868 --> 05:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
with smallscale Hydro uh I can give you
 
05:11:21.030 --> 05:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
an example there's um a hydro a small
 
05:11:24.390 --> 05:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
Hydro facility in the town of bosin um
 
05:11:27.390 --> 05:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
the town of bosin is very interested in
 
05:11:29.230 --> 05:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
entering a a group net metering
 
05:11:31.628 --> 05:11:31.638 align:start position:0%
arrangement with that facility where the
 
05:11:31.638 --> 05:11:32.470 align:start position:0%
arrangement with that facility where the
town

05:11:32.470 --> 05:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
town
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh facilities could um uh could use that
 
05:11:38.910 --> 05:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
power that's being generated locally and
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
so that's the example where um an
 
05:11:44.270 --> 05:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
example of where Hydro facilities could
 
05:11:46.670 --> 05:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
be group net metering and and Mr Hayden
 
05:11:49.628 --> 05:11:49.638 align:start position:0%
also testified earlier today um this is
 
05:11:51.948 --> 05:11:51.958 align:start position:0%
already happening um for hydro
 
05:11:55.110 --> 05:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
facilities that are one megawatt or less
 
05:11:57.830 --> 05:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
um he's created a a product essentially
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
where he's um uh M doing you know
 
05:12:03.788 --> 05:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
matchmaking essentially with with small
 
05:12:06.150 --> 05:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
Hydro facilities under one megawatt and
 
05:12:08.628 --> 05:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
matching them up with um schools and
 
05:12:11.030 --> 05:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities who are interested in
 
05:12:14.510 --> 05:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
group net metering with those
 
05:12:18.270 --> 05:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
facilities may I follow up yes follow up
 
05:12:21.110 --> 05:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
well my followup is basically do you
 
05:12:25.510 --> 05:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
need net metering to sell power so I
 
05:12:28.788 --> 05:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
have a generating facility could I
 
05:12:31.150 --> 05:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
approach whether in high let's say a
 
05:12:33.310 --> 05:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
hydro facility facility could I approach
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
the electric company myself and and go
 
05:12:39.788 --> 05:12:39.798 align:start position:0%
with a power purchase agreement without
 
05:12:39.798 --> 05:12:42.708 align:start position:0%
with a power purchase agreement without
net

05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:45.070 --> 05:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
metering if you were
 
05:12:49.030 --> 05:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
a uh individual it was in a if it were
 
05:12:52.948 --> 05:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
in a wholesale Arrangement um yes that's
 
05:12:55.270 --> 05:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
an option but if it's in a retail
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
Arrangement it is not an option and I
 
05:12:59.270 --> 05:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
think um as we've talked about you know
 
05:13:01.868 --> 05:13:01.878 align:start position:0%
I think there's there's Val differ the
 
05:13:04.430 --> 05:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
there's value being lost by generating
 
05:13:07.030 --> 05:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
power locally and then shipping it out
 
05:13:09.230 --> 05:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
into the wholesale market and at the
 
05:13:11.910 --> 05:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
same time purchasing power out in the
 
05:13:15.030 --> 05:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
market and importing it um we're kind of
 
05:13:18.110 --> 05:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
paying double on the transmission side
 
05:13:21.310 --> 05:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
um as is one one place where we're we're
 
05:13:23.750 --> 05:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
not taking advantage of the locally
 
05:13:27.190 --> 05:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
produced power thank
 
05:13:29.470 --> 05:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you I have a question for you
 
05:13:31.390 --> 05:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
miss croll you mentioned a few minutes
 
05:13:35.190 --> 05:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
ago a group net Beering situation in
 
05:13:38.948 --> 05:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
which a host was generating power and
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
selling it to a group of folks that had
 
05:13:45.230 --> 05:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
agreed to become part of the
 
05:13:47.948 --> 05:13:47.958 align:start position:0%
group what would the host sell that
 
05:13:52.150 --> 05:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:56.070 --> 05:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
four so that would be negotiated between
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
the group
 
05:14:00.150 --> 05:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
members um and the
 
05:14:03.548 --> 05:14:03.558 align:start position:0%
generator um obviously they're going
 
05:14:06.390 --> 05:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
to uh those group members are going to
 
05:14:08.230 --> 05:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
look at this as a
 
05:14:11.430 --> 05:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
competitive alternative um and so
 
05:14:12.788 --> 05:14:12.798 align:start position:0%
they're going to look at what they could
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
buy power from a a third party supplier
 
05:14:18.190 --> 05:14:18.200 align:start position:0%
they'll look at what the default service
 
05:14:20.190 --> 05:14:20.200 align:start position:0%
rate is for their utility and then they
 
05:14:25.070 --> 05:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
would look at this uh option as well um
 
05:14:27.868 --> 05:14:27.878 align:start position:0%
and so I can tell you that basically how
 
05:14:30.390 --> 05:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
it works currently with the the hydro
 
05:14:34.390 --> 05:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
facilities under one Mega wat um
 
05:14:37.910 --> 05:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
those uh utilities or or generators are
 
05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
putting um their power into the grid um
 
05:14:44.070 --> 05:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
they're getting uh a credit equal to the
 
05:14:47.150 --> 05:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
default service rate from the local
 
05:14:49.788 --> 05:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
utility at the same time kind of on the
 
05:14:52.470 --> 05:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
other end of the wire if you will is a
 
05:14:55.548 --> 05:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
group of customers taking that power off
 
05:14:59.110 --> 05:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
the grid um and let's say you know if
 
05:15:02.670 --> 05:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
the default service rate is8 cents and
 
05:15:05.470 --> 05:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
the hydro generator has agreed to sell
 
05:15:10.548 --> 05:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
the power for 6 and half cents um then
 
05:15:13.628 --> 05:15:13.638 align:start position:0%
the hydr power generator is cutting a
 
05:15:17.628 --> 05:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
check every month to the group members
 
05:15:20.990 --> 05:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
for a penny and a half namely the
 
05:15:22.708 --> 05:15:22.718 align:start position:0%
difference between the default service
 
05:15:25.670 --> 05:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
price the credit they're getting and the
 
05:15:27.628 --> 05:15:27.638 align:start position:0%
agreed upon sale
 
05:15:30.150 --> 05:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
price so it is an important thing to
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
note um that in group net meeting
 
05:15:34.910 --> 05:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
Arrangements um even though we talk
 
05:15:37.030 --> 05:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
about the credit being the default
 
05:15:39.430 --> 05:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
service price in fact
 
05:15:42.230 --> 05:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
generators um
 
05:15:45.230 --> 05:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
are in the end you know they don't get
 
05:15:47.270 --> 05:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
they don't keep that they they give some
 
05:15:49.708 --> 05:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
of that back to the group members so
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
that kind of the group members are
 
05:15:53.150 --> 05:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
buying down their cost of default
 
05:15:55.628 --> 05:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
service power
 
05:15:58.470 --> 05:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
um that answer your question thank you
 
05:16:01.590 --> 05:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
for that explanation so no further
 
05:16:03.190 --> 05:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss croll I'll call on
 
05:16:06.030 --> 05:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
the final speaker for this bill and that
 
05:16:08.628 --> 05:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
is Doria Brown who is representing the
 
05:16:11.548 --> 05:16:11.558 align:start position:0%
city of Nashua Miss Brown you have the
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
floor for two minutes hello I'm Doria
 
05:16:19.788 --> 05:16:19.798 align:start position:0%
Brown and I'm here in support of HB 148
 
05:16:23.430 --> 05:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
I did want to quickly lay out the how
 
05:16:25.110 --> 05:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
much we make from our Hydro facilities
 
05:16:29.590 --> 05:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
for our Jackson Mills and Mine Falls Dam
 
05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
so that you get a better idea of that
 
05:16:35.390 --> 05:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
difference so Jackson produces about
 
05:16:38.470 --> 05:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
11,22 megawatt hours per year and from
 
05:16:41.708 --> 05:16:41.718 align:start position:0%
generation we make a profit of $400,000
 
05:16:45.868 --> 05:16:45.878 align:start position:0%
per year while mindes Falls we generate
 
05:16:48.350 --> 05:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
2,681 megawatt hours per year and we're
 
05:16:51.350 --> 05:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
making a profit from that generation of
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
$440,000 so we're making more than twice
 
05:16:56.430 --> 05:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
as much electricity from our mind ball
 
05:16:59.190 --> 05:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
Stam but not making nearly as much off
 
05:17:01.830 --> 05:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
of that energy generation and now jhua
 
05:17:05.510 --> 05:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
stands to really gain more value for the
 
05:17:07.590 --> 05:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
energy that we are producing from MF
 
05:17:09.470 --> 05:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
Falls if we're able to increase that net
 
05:17:11.628 --> 05:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
metering cap for our hydroelectric
 
05:17:14.270 --> 05:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
facilities and I also wanted to address
 
05:17:15.868 --> 05:17:15.878 align:start position:0%
I know that question wasn't for me but
 
05:17:17.548 --> 05:17:17.558 align:start position:0%
that net that group net metering
 
05:17:20.030 --> 05:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
question if we were to group N meter
 
05:17:24.628 --> 05:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
with a with our residents or our um or
 
05:17:27.350 --> 05:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
our facilities we would have to make
 
05:17:28.548 --> 05:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
sure that we
 
05:17:31.548 --> 05:17:31.558 align:start position:0%
generate the right amount of energy
 
05:17:34.230 --> 05:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
every single month and we would actually
 
05:17:36.310 --> 05:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
end up if we don't generate enough
 
05:17:37.708 --> 05:17:37.718 align:start position:0%
electricity in the business of
 
05:17:41.110 --> 05:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
purchasing excess electricity for energy
 
05:17:44.070 --> 05:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
that we have to make up and that is not
 
05:17:46.948 --> 05:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
a business we really want to enter
 
05:17:50.150 --> 05:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
into so it might become more costly to
 
05:17:53.030 --> 05:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
group net meter if essentially the water
 
05:17:56.788 --> 05:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
isn't flowing that month I I just wanted
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:04.190 --> 05:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
that okay is that the extent of your
 
05:18:06.190 --> 05:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
testimony yes I I'd like to take
 
05:18:11.070 --> 05:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
questions now okay fine thank you so uh
 
05:18:13.628 --> 05:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
representative ssuch is recognized for a
 
05:18:15.948 --> 05:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:18:18.750 --> 05:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Brown for for taking my
 
05:18:21.150 --> 05:18:21.160 align:start position:0%
question fact I have two questions
 
05:18:25.230 --> 05:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
really and I asked before uh previously
 
05:18:27.470 --> 05:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
and um they told me you'd be the better
 
05:18:29.788 --> 05:18:29.798 align:start position:0%
person to answer this but could you tell
 
05:18:32.350 --> 05:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
me a little bit about the environmental
 
05:18:34.628 --> 05:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
benefit that you you do your your
 
05:18:37.788 --> 05:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
National operators at the dam provide as
 
05:18:40.830 --> 05:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
far as the river uh quality of the river
 
05:18:43.788 --> 05:18:43.798 align:start position:0%
and and environment is concerned and my
 
05:18:46.310 --> 05:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
second question is have you considered
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
any type of energy storage on these
 
05:18:53.230 --> 05:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
dams so I am here filling in for Deb
 
05:18:54.910 --> 05:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
chis home because she had a meeting at
 
05:18:58.310 --> 05:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
this time but she thankfully was able to
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
give me some of the down low on what's
 
05:19:02.310 --> 05:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
going on with these dams when it comes
 
05:19:04.590 --> 05:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
to cleaning water or cleaning the water
 
05:19:07.628 --> 05:19:07.638 align:start position:0%
around it so yes the dams are
 
05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for cleaning a lot of the
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
debris around them as water flows to the
 
05:19:16.350 --> 05:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
river and they are a big benefit to the
 
05:19:20.590 --> 05:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
Nashville River because they do that I
 
05:19:23.628 --> 05:19:23.638 align:start position:0%
also do not think that we've explored
 
05:19:26.110 --> 05:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
adding storage to these dams as it would
 
05:19:28.750 --> 05:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
be extremely expensive maybe in the
 
05:19:30.510 --> 05:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
future if we were able to net meter
 
05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
these facilities we would have more
 
05:19:36.590 --> 05:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
storage okay thank
 
05:19:42.910 --> 05:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you um representative
 
05:19:44.868 --> 05:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
Cali pittson is recognized for a
 
05:19:47.390 --> 05:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry to put you on the
 
05:19:52.030 --> 05:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
spot Miss Brown um you you pointed out
 
05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
that you make about $840,000 a year
 
05:19:59.030 --> 05:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
between the two dams my thought is if
 
05:20:01.948 --> 05:20:01.958 align:start position:0%
the if you Pro if this meing went up
 
05:20:04.868 --> 05:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
you'd make about 1.2 million what is the
 
05:20:06.590 --> 05:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
do you know what the operating cost of
 
05:20:07.990 --> 05:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
those two dams
 
05:20:11.628 --> 05:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
are I do not know off the top of my head
 
05:20:14.430 --> 05:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
what the operating costs of the two dams
 
05:20:17.150 --> 05:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
are but I can get that information back
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
to you when I meet with our waterways
 
05:20:24.190 --> 05:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
manager you man follow yes not knowing
 
05:20:26.910 --> 05:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
much about dams except the ones I've
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
visited and enjoyed looking at are
 
05:20:35.590 --> 05:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
is there much maintenance involved in
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
upkeep of these dams I know there's you
 
05:20:42.110 --> 05:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
know the the the turbines but other than
 
05:20:44.910 --> 05:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
that is there quite a bit of maintenance
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
on these do you know so you do I can
 
05:20:52.070 --> 05:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
wait for that you do have maintenance
 
05:20:54.628 --> 05:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
with keeping these dams running I I do
 
05:20:57.390 --> 05:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
want to point out that we recently had a
 
05:20:59.830 --> 05:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
turbine issue with one of our dams that
 
05:21:02.708 --> 05:21:02.718 align:start position:0%
is going to be very cost for us to fix
 
05:21:04.830 --> 05:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
so when those those issues do come up
 
05:21:09.070 --> 05:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
they kind of overshadow the the smaller
 
05:21:10.990 --> 05:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
cost or the smaller annual cost of
 
05:21:14.750 --> 05:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:19.590 --> 05:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
dams so they they are expensive to
 
05:21:22.590 --> 05:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
upkeep okay thank you for that uh thank
 
05:21:25.948 --> 05:21:25.958 align:start position:0%
you I have a question uh are fish
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
ladders a
 
05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
concern uh in this
 
05:21:30.040 --> 05:21:31.868 align:start position:0%
concern uh in this
situation

05:21:31.868 --> 05:21:31.878 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:21:34.110 --> 05:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't see Fish ladders as a concern
 
05:21:36.270 --> 05:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
in the net metering situation but we do
 
05:21:38.430 --> 05:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
have a fish ladder on the Mine Falls Dam
 
05:21:40.830 --> 05:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
if you want to come see it you're more
 
05:21:42.670 --> 05:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
than welcome to I'm sure our waterways

Other Place listening to the court casee
 
05:23:05.590 --> 05:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
and I thought that was it just
 
05:23:08.510 --> 05:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
seeing real lawyers in
 
05:23:12.670 --> 05:23:12.680 align:start position:0%

05:23:14.788 --> 05:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
it was really an interesting process
 
05:23:14.798 --> 05:23:16.190 align:start position:0%
it was really an interesting process
just

05:23:16.190 --> 05:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:23:19.070 --> 05:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
listening I I can't I can't do that two
 
05:23:21.590 --> 05:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
things at the same time I I I admire
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
that I was trained by the phone company
 
05:23:27.868 --> 05:23:27.878 align:start position:0%
you had to be an octopus to work
 
05:23:31.830 --> 05:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
there when he when he when he
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
not good hey Lee how you doing these
 
05:23:36.830 --> 05:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
days feeling
 
05:23:40.150 --> 05:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
better a little thank you that very
 
05:23:45.030 --> 05:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:50.270 --> 05:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
it okay uh cat's not on right now
 
05:23:53.788 --> 05:23:53.798 align:start position:0%
I I got my bills confused was it really
 
05:23:57.350 --> 05:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:59.708 --> 05:23:59.718 align:start position:0%
been just that's okay we all get
 
05:24:01.948 --> 05:24:01.958 align:start position:0%
confused and if you noticed nobody said
 
05:24:03.750 --> 05:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
anything so that means everybody else
 
05:24:05.910 --> 05:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
was confused I'm feeling like such a
 
05:24:08.230 --> 05:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
rookie sometimes here though you know
 
05:24:13.110 --> 05:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
out out of class so no don't ever be
 
05:24:17.390 --> 05:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
quiet let your thoughts flow and and you
 
05:24:19.750 --> 05:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
know well I figure it's a way to learn I
 
05:24:21.628 --> 05:24:21.638 align:start position:0%
guess so and that's the way that's why
 
05:24:25.070 --> 05:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
elected I ask case you can find anybody
 
05:24:29.750 --> 05:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
else for the job personally
 
05:24:29.760 --> 05:24:32.948 align:start position:0%
else for the job personally
but

05:24:32.948 --> 05:24:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:34.990 --> 05:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
so what's it looking like for the uh I
 
05:24:36.830 --> 05:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
mean are you getting any read from the
 
05:24:38.830 --> 05:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh judge or anything I hav't I've not
 
05:24:43.470 --> 05:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
been watching I no I it I think I
 
05:24:45.510 --> 05:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten up I and I don't hear
 
05:24:46.868 --> 05:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
anything so I think either they're in a
 
05:24:48.628 --> 05:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
break or the arguments are concluded it
 
05:24:50.190 --> 05:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
sounded like they were
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
concluding and they asked to file briefs
 
05:24:59.430 --> 05:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:02.910 --> 05:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
know I I don't want to show up if I mean
 
05:25:05.430 --> 05:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
it just seems like you know I mean
 
05:25:06.868 --> 05:25:06.878 align:start position:0%
there's nobody's talking about a show of
 
05:25:09.350 --> 05:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
solidarity with the people who are uh
 
05:25:11.510 --> 05:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
with our handicapped people well let me
 
05:25:14.910 --> 05:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
tell you I have a heart condition I have
 
05:25:17.548 --> 05:25:17.558 align:start position:0%
severe o osteoarthritis you don't know
 
05:25:19.470 --> 05:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
it except sometimes when I go to get up
 
05:25:21.868 --> 05:25:21.878 align:start position:0%
in a session and I can't stand up that's
 
05:25:23.470 --> 05:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
the benefit of being
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
home um and a lot of other things going
 
05:25:31.150 --> 05:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
on so I think that add Plus I'm an old
 
05:25:32.430 --> 05:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
lady and I'm
 
05:25:35.390 --> 05:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
overweight so that makes me vulnerable
 
05:25:39.230 --> 05:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
and the last time when we met
 
05:25:41.788 --> 05:25:41.798 align:start position:0%
outside there were a few Representatives
 
05:25:45.230 --> 05:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
walking up and down my shoulder who
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have masks on it made me very
 
05:25:49.948 --> 05:25:49.958 align:start position:0%
nervous they weren't certainly weren't
 
05:25:52.150 --> 05:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
six feet apart and if you look at our
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
committee which I would say that head
 
05:25:57.510 --> 05:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
table isn't six feet apart without masks
 
05:25:59.070 --> 05:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
so I
 
05:26:02.230 --> 05:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
just I feel my duty to go I haven't
 
05:26:04.150 --> 05:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
missed a session except in March when I
 
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
was in the hospital but I
 
05:26:10.628 --> 05:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
do I'm taor
 
05:26:13.270 --> 05:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
because you know I want to live to see
 
05:26:13.280 --> 05:26:15.070 align:start position:0%
because you know I want to live to see
next

05:26:15.070 --> 05:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
next
 
05:26:17.708 --> 05:26:17.718 align:start position:0%
year why this got my second shot this
 
05:26:21.910 --> 05:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
morning so and how was it are you okay
 
05:26:23.868 --> 05:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
yeah but you know it's you don't have
 
05:26:27.350 --> 05:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
any reaction so far not wood not a thing
 
05:26:30.070 --> 05:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
so great I'm I'm supposed to get mine
 
05:26:33.030 --> 05:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and I'm at 9:00 so I'm going to
 
05:26:34.590 --> 05:26:34.600 align:start position:0%

be late to
session

05:26:36.670 --> 05:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
session
 
05:26:40.590 --> 05:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
um but I was afraid of a reaction So you
 
05:26:42.990 --> 05:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
you're okay good I'm glad yeah I was
 
05:26:44.750 --> 05:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
nervous what does it take Tuesday isn't
 
05:26:48.868 --> 05:26:48.878 align:start position:0%
session Jackie huh no but I'm afraid of
 
05:26:52.830 --> 05:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid of Wednesday oh gotcha I'm
 
05:26:55.230 --> 05:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
sorry Jackie there's no uh vaccine out
 
05:26:56.350 --> 05:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
there that's going to be tougher than
 
05:26:59.230 --> 05:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
you are don't worry about it well no
 
05:27:02.788 --> 05:27:02.798 align:start position:0%
self-respecting German with nii exactly
 
05:27:04.510 --> 05:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
I wasn't putting it that way but I'm
 
05:27:07.830 --> 05:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
just saying you're you're a tough lady
 
05:27:10.830 --> 05:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
yeah but having a drive that
 
05:27:10.840 --> 05:27:13.788 align:start position:0%
yeah but having a drive that
far

05:27:13.788 --> 05:27:13.798 align:start position:0%
far
 
05:27:16.750 --> 05:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
um it it does you know take me back a
 
05:27:19.390 --> 05:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
little bit but I am afraid of it I am
 
05:27:21.470 --> 05:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
and it's not just driving there but you
 
05:27:22.948 --> 05:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
know it's the whole day and then you
 
05:27:25.708 --> 05:27:25.718 align:start position:0%
have to drive back and maybe it's dark
 
05:27:27.430 --> 05:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's just you know there's
 
05:27:31.030 --> 05:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
just a lot of things well if it's dark I
 
05:27:33.430 --> 05:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
can just get up and leave I mean you
 
05:27:33.440 --> 05:27:35.350 align:start position:0%
can just get up and leave I mean you
know

05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:27:38.788 --> 05:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
I I left early from the last session and
 
05:27:40.788 --> 05:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
I pulled up to the back gate at peas
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
because that was the only place I could
 
05:27:46.190 --> 05:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
get to listen to the last little bit on
 
05:27:48.750 --> 05:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
radio and you know they sent security
 
05:27:51.708 --> 05:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:54.150 --> 05:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
after and just what do you think you're
 
05:27:56.150 --> 05:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
doing here well exactly what are you
 
05:27:58.708 --> 05:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
sitting at the back gate for the
 
05:28:00.788 --> 05:28:00.798 align:start position:0%
Neighbors reported me I said I'm
 
05:28:03.590 --> 05:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
listening to the radio and I when I you
 
05:28:05.830 --> 05:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
know I roll the window down put my mask
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
on I said here what are you listening to
 
05:28:12.510 --> 05:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
what kind of music is
 
05:28:16.628 --> 05:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
that God bless security from the base
 
05:28:20.070 --> 05:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
but yeah I mean uh because I didn't want
 
05:28:21.948 --> 05:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
to drive home in the dark I'm getting
 
05:28:24.070 --> 05:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
old I realize
 
05:28:26.350 --> 05:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
that well look at the option there's
 
05:28:29.190 --> 05:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:32.390 --> 05:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
so I I still I don't have that because I
 
05:28:34.708 --> 05:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
don't have death there's living and
 
05:28:37.110 --> 05:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
there's dying I don't have death
 
05:28:39.510 --> 05:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
insurance so that's not an option I
 
05:28:41.910 --> 05:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
think what he's saying is that I know
 
05:28:44.430 --> 05:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
he's okay with the op so I have a teabag
 
05:28:45.310 --> 05:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
here I just want to tell you what it
 
05:28:47.390 --> 05:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
says let your energy be used to build
 
05:28:47.400 --> 05:28:48.270 align:start position:0%
says let your energy be used to build
not

05:28:48.270 --> 05:28:48.280 align:start position:0%

05:28:59.628 --> 05:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
teabags that's how to get the message
 
05:29:01.868 --> 05:29:01.878 align:start position:0%
out teabag
 
05:29:03.470 --> 05:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
while we've got a second there was a lot
 
05:29:05.310 --> 05:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
of discussion uh I don't know last month
 
05:29:07.910 --> 05:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever on nuclear power and where
 
05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
we're going with it um would anyone been
 
05:29:12.350 --> 05:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
interested there's a there's a Ser
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
series of stuff that's come out with the
 
05:29:15.230 --> 05:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
with the government the federal
 
05:29:16.548 --> 05:29:16.558 align:start position:0%
government's been funding various
 
05:29:19.788 --> 05:29:19.798 align:start position:0%
Advanced uh nuclear reactor Concepts if
 
05:29:21.430 --> 05:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
the committee's interested in that I
 
05:29:24.190 --> 05:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
could distribute it to them I'd love to
 
05:29:25.270 --> 05:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
see it
 
05:29:27.868 --> 05:29:27.878 align:start position:0%
Mike unless unless you happen to be
 
05:29:29.708 --> 05:29:29.718 align:start position:0%
subscriber to nuclear news you probably
 
05:29:31.948 --> 05:29:31.958 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it yet but I get nuclear
 
05:29:34.510 --> 05:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
news okay there youle husband gets it I
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
assume right yeah but he show he Flags
 
05:29:40.190 --> 05:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
everything for me yeah it's amazingly
 
05:29:44.948 --> 05:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
interesting reading you know yeah in the
 
05:29:47.190 --> 05:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
Texas context that even the nuclear
 
05:29:50.270 --> 05:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
plant had failure because of the cold
 
05:29:52.230 --> 05:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
yeah actually the the plant is uh back
 
05:29:54.990 --> 05:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
going it's going back up right now it
 
05:29:57.948 --> 05:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
had a u a sensing line to the feedwater
 
05:30:00.510 --> 05:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
pumps froze and then the feed water pump
 
05:30:02.110 --> 05:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
shut down and once they shut down the
 
05:30:05.030 --> 05:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
Plant trips and the problem down there
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
is that there's so more designed for
 
05:30:10.310 --> 05:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
dissipating heat so all of their it's
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
nothing like seab Brook I know a lot of
 
05:30:13.548 --> 05:30:13.558 align:start position:0%
the committee has been to seab Brook
 
05:30:15.030 --> 05:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
everything's indoors everything's
 
05:30:16.708 --> 05:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
Outdoors down there because they want to
 
05:30:18.868 --> 05:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
dissipate as much heat as they can and
 
05:30:20.548 --> 05:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
this feed water sensing line for the
 
05:30:23.310 --> 05:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
pump froze H because I I think the
 
05:30:25.110 --> 05:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
temperature got down actually below zero
 
05:30:27.230 --> 05:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
down there it's yes it did wrecked
 
05:30:29.350 --> 05:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
wrecked cold I think they also
 
05:30:31.070 --> 05:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
deregulated so they didn't have any
 
05:30:32.750 --> 05:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
oversight saying what they should be
 
05:30:34.910 --> 05:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
doing in terms of resiliency that's
 
05:30:36.830 --> 05:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's part of the problem too well the
 
05:30:38.628 --> 05:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
whole thing of Texas is it's remember as
 
05:30:41.510 --> 05:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
you probably aware it's its own uh own
 
05:30:44.830 --> 05:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
gr there's no firk regulation on it and
 
05:30:46.350 --> 05:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a capacity Market but
 
05:30:48.190 --> 05:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
the nuclear plants are still regulated
 
05:30:50.350 --> 05:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
by the uh nuclear Regulatory Commission
 
05:30:52.190 --> 05:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
it was just one of these things that no
 
05:30:53.910 --> 05:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
one expected it and they put out this
 
05:30:57.390 --> 05:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
big warning uh about a week ago and they
 
05:30:59.910 --> 05:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
it was even colder than they thought so
 
05:31:01.510 --> 05:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
I mean everything started to freeze
 
05:31:04.110 --> 05:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
natural gas froze wind froze obviously
 
05:31:06.190 --> 05:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
if you got ice you're not getting solar
 
05:31:07.910 --> 05:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then the nuclear plant tripped off
 
05:31:10.670 --> 05:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
because of this uh sensing line freezing
 
05:31:12.830 --> 05:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
so about everything bad that could
 
05:31:15.310 --> 05:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
happen to about every source of energy
 
05:31:18.030 --> 05:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
happened almost simultaneously there was
 
05:31:20.030 --> 05:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
no particular one you can say this is
 
05:31:22.750 --> 05:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
the fault of other than it was it hit
 
05:31:25.948 --> 05:31:25.958 align:start position:0%
everything so as our chair tried to tell
 
05:31:27.910 --> 05:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
us this morning there was an immediate
 
05:31:30.310 --> 05:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
oh it's because of all that renewable
 
05:31:32.910 --> 05:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
energy which it was
 
05:31:37.110 --> 05:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:42.070 --> 05:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
de% fossil fuel we could have Mike was
 
05:31:44.230 --> 05:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
the plant ever in danger could they shut
 
05:31:46.390 --> 05:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
did they shut it down or oh it was a
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
safe shut down it was automatic when the
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
feed water pumps go there's suff
 
05:31:51.390 --> 05:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
insufficient flow to the steam
 
05:31:53.470 --> 05:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
generators the plant shuts down it was
 
05:31:55.670 --> 05:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
it was no no safety issue whatsoever so
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
the core didn't get no no there was no
 
05:32:00.788 --> 05:32:00.798 align:start position:0%
no problem whatsoever with that I just
 
05:32:03.868 --> 05:32:03.878 align:start position:0%
I heard that and I thought no tsunami
 
05:32:07.868 --> 05:32:07.878 align:start position:0%
your um nuclear uh for the entire
 
05:32:14.750 --> 05:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:16.830 --> 05:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting I'm sorry I I'm sorry I
 
05:32:18.670 --> 05:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
didn't quite hear what the question
 
05:32:25.030 --> 05:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:28.510 --> 05:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
thanks chair V we can't hear you yeah
 
05:32:32.868 --> 05:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:35.390 --> 05:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh how about can we get Fred he's in the
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
room the room is muted the gotta go turn
 
05:32:41.470 --> 05:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
on the room
 
05:32:47.190 --> 05:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:50.670 --> 05:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
second okay can you hear me
 
05:32:54.030 --> 05:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
now all right fascinating discussion and
 
05:32:56.150 --> 05:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
we'll take it up later we have some time
 
05:32:58.548 --> 05:32:58.558 align:start position:0%
but we're late for starting
 
05:33:00.510 --> 05:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:33:02.868 --> 05:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the last bill of the
 
05:33:07.670 --> 05:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
day which is HB
 
05:33:10.910 --> 05:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
167 I have a copy of right
 
05:33:14.310 --> 05:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
here the prime sponsor of this bill is
 
05:33:16.830 --> 05:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams so I'm going
 
05:33:19.030 --> 05:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
to turn the floor over to representative
 
05:33:20.788 --> 05:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
MC Williams for five minutes to
 
05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
introduce this
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you chair Vose um for the
 
05:33:29.110 --> 05:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
record my name is Rebecca McWilliams I
 
05:33:31.910 --> 05:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
am a representative from conquer's wests
 
05:33:33.590 --> 05:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
side marac
 
05:33:36.310 --> 05:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
27 um House Bill
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
167 is a necessary bill for the State of
 
05:33:45.070 --> 05:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the State of the Union
 
05:33:48.470 --> 05:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
right now uh climate change is real it's
 
05:33:50.430 --> 05:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
happening right now New Hampshire has
 
05:33:52.470 --> 05:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
experienced two extreme droughts
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
decimating our agricultural businesses
 
05:33:57.310 --> 05:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
over the past 5 years California's Fire
 
05:33:59.190 --> 05:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
season is lasting longer and
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
intensifying the number of Acres burned
 
05:34:04.548 --> 05:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
every year 2016 was the hottest year
 
05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
ever recorded on earth and now an Arctic
 
05:34:10.590 --> 05:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
freeze has settled Over Texas this week
 
05:34:13.110 --> 05:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
and killed 47 Americans so far due to
 
05:34:15.390 --> 05:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
widespread power outages this is a
 
05:34:17.110 --> 05:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
failure of the
 
05:34:19.510 --> 05:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
system we the members of the science
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee are the
 
05:34:23.590 --> 05:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
smart folks who are working to do
 
05:34:25.830 --> 05:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
whatever we can to fix some of these
 
05:34:28.150 --> 05:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
issues it's our job to understand what's
 
05:34:30.470 --> 05:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
going on what went wrong in the energy
 
05:34:32.910 --> 05:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
sectors and to address them for the
 
05:34:35.788 --> 05:34:35.798 align:start position:0%
ongoing climate disasters New Hampshire
 
05:34:38.150 --> 05:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
is part of iso New England one big
 
05:34:40.510 --> 05:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
bathtub of energy shared across all of
 
05:34:42.390 --> 05:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
the New England states we are still
 
05:34:44.990 --> 05:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
subject to disasters the potential for a
 
05:34:47.470 --> 05:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
major grid problem could happen to us
 
05:34:50.030 --> 05:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
from storms tornadoes hurricanes fires
 
05:34:52.350 --> 05:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
floods and freezing
 
05:34:55.548 --> 05:34:55.558 align:start position:0%
temperatures we the members of House St
 
05:34:57.548 --> 05:34:57.558 align:start position:0%
have the power to switch the source and
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
mobilize our local businesses to
 
05:35:02.030 --> 05:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
increase local homegrown power sources
 
05:35:05.150 --> 05:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
and create local jobs ISO New England
 
05:35:06.510 --> 05:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
has stated that infrastructure
 
05:35:08.310 --> 05:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
constraints could pose a challenge to
 
05:35:10.788 --> 05:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
the reliable operation of the regional
 
05:35:12.830 --> 05:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
power grid which would create price
 
05:35:15.590 --> 05:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
increases and volatility contribute to
 
05:35:17.470 --> 05:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
increased air emissions all of which
 
05:35:19.310 --> 05:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
would adversely impact New Hampshire's

citizens businesses and economy it's in
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
the best interest of all citizens of New
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%

energy and help mitigate the cost of
 
05:35:45.708 --> 05:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
electric service in the state this will
 
05:35:47.628 --> 05:35:47.638 align:start position:0%
reduce the price volatility of electric

longer have a capacity commitment with
 
05:36:14.030 --> 05:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
ISO New England or are no longer a
 
05:36:14.040 --> 05:36:15.230 align:start position:0%
ISO New England or are no longer a
registered

05:36:15.230 --> 05:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
registered
 
05:36:17.190 --> 05:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
generator retiring from the wholesale
 
05:36:19.430 --> 05:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
markets takes a couple of years um but
 
05:36:21.310 --> 05:36:21.320 align:start position:0%
the expectation is that these generators
 
05:36:23.948 --> 05:36:23.958 align:start position:0%
would stick around and participate as
 
05:36:26.150 --> 05:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
well as creating the development of new
 
05:36:28.750 --> 05:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
projects especially at Municipal sites
 
05:36:30.910 --> 05:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
so our current utility scale solar
 
05:36:32.868 --> 05:36:32.878 align:start position:0%
installations in New Hampshire our
 
05:36:35.548 --> 05:36:35.558 align:start position:0%
Fidelity Fidelity Investments in meramac
 
05:36:37.868 --> 05:36:37.878 align:start position:0%
which has approximately 3 megawatts and
 
05:36:39.510 --> 05:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative
 
05:36:42.470 --> 05:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
solar farm in molten Boro at 2 megawatts
 
05:36:44.150 --> 05:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
so most of these existing facilities
 
05:36:46.590 --> 05:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
that the pu's references referencing for
 
05:36:50.350 --> 05:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
25 facilities um are Hydro facilities in
 
05:36:53.190 --> 05:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where we value our freedom
 
05:36:56.150 --> 05:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
home brewed electricity from our own
 
05:36:57.788 --> 05:36:57.798 align:start position:0%
customer generators is the right
 
05:37:00.350 --> 05:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
prescription for our Energy Future
 
05:37:03.830 --> 05:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:06.390 --> 05:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative MC
 
05:37:08.590 --> 05:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
Williams three minutes and 33 seconds
 
05:37:11.948 --> 05:37:11.958 align:start position:0%
nicely done I have a question for you on
 
05:37:16.830 --> 05:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
page three of the bill lines two through
 
05:37:19.628 --> 05:37:19.638 align:start position:0%
11 is this the exact same language we
 
05:37:23.430 --> 05:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
heard this morning in house bille
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
106 um let me pull up lines 2 through
 
05:37:30.628 --> 05:37:30.638 align:start position:0%
seven on page P three so I'm looking at
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:38.430 --> 05:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
you it appears to be but I don't have
 
05:37:40.830 --> 05:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
the bill from this morning open um it
 
05:37:44.230 --> 05:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
does look similar from a cursory
 
05:37:47.230 --> 05:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
glance okay my followup question uh is
 
05:37:52.310 --> 05:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
this bill um identical or extremely
 
05:37:57.788 --> 05:37:57.798 align:start position:0%
similar to uh House Bill 1218 from last
 
05:38:00.070 --> 05:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
year this is similar
 
05:38:00.080 --> 05:38:02.628 align:start position:0%
year this is similar
to

05:38:02.628 --> 05:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:05.548 --> 05:38:05.558 align:start position:0%
1218 do you know how it
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
differs um so we've changed some
 
05:38:13.470 --> 05:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:13.480 --> 05:38:15.868 align:start position:0%
 
implementation

05:38:15.868 --> 05:38:15.878 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
05:38:17.910 --> 05:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if there was a new
 
05:38:21.270 --> 05:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
analysis or not performed at the end um
 
05:38:23.548 --> 05:38:23.558 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to tell um I'd have to
 
05:38:25.030 --> 05:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
compare the analysis portion but the
 
05:38:26.948 --> 05:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
dates have been changed in the
 
05:38:30.590 --> 05:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank you very much
 
05:38:32.510 --> 05:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative CL is recognized for a
 
05:38:35.070 --> 05:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman for the
 
05:38:35.080 --> 05:38:36.230 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman for the
existing

05:38:36.230 --> 05:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
existing
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
25 facilities to qualify what is the
 
05:38:42.150 --> 05:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
benefit to uh rate payers of New
 
05:38:43.628 --> 05:38:43.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it just raises their rates
 
05:38:46.590 --> 05:38:46.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't it same same electricity already
 
05:38:46.600 --> 05:38:48.150 align:start position:0%
doesn't it same same electricity already
being

05:38:48.150 --> 05:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:38:52.670 --> 05:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
produced so we're talking about creating
 
05:38:56.510 --> 05:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
local H grown energy that will be
 
05:38:59.708 --> 05:38:59.718 align:start position:0%
consistent and reliable even when
 
05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
something in ISO New England impacts the
 
05:39:06.070 --> 05:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
larger grid such as a great freeze for
 
05:39:08.510 --> 05:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
example like what just happened in
 
05:39:11.190 --> 05:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
Texas um what we're talking about is
 
05:39:13.868 --> 05:39:13.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps an additional cost for that
 
05:39:16.590 --> 05:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
reliability but on the average I would
 
05:39:18.910 --> 05:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
say that it's worthwhile to have our own
 
05:39:22.948 --> 05:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
local producers um able to contribute at
 
05:39:25.070 --> 05:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
that level so what we're talking about
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
is incentivizing homegrown
 
05:39:28.440 --> 05:39:32.750 align:start position:0%
is incentivizing homegrown
energy

05:39:32.750 --> 05:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um next up for questions
 
05:39:38.390 --> 05:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
I don't see anybody else put their hand
 
05:39:41.150 --> 05:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
up so thank you representative MC MCM
 
05:39:44.030 --> 05:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
Williams we will now call on our next
 
05:39:47.150 --> 05:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
speaker who is Clifton Belo The
 
05:39:49.750 --> 05:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
Honorable Clifton Belo uh representing
 
05:39:51.750 --> 05:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon Mr Belo you have the
 
05:39:54.948 --> 05:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:58.350 --> 05:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
minutes whoops I guess I have to promote
 
05:39:58.360 --> 05:40:07.510 align:start position:0%
minutes whoops I guess I have to promote
you

05:40:07.510 --> 05:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:07.520 --> 05:40:10.270 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:40:10.270 --> 05:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:16.390 --> 05:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:20.468 --> 05:40:20.478 align:start position:0%
building so we will move on and turn the
 
05:40:24.510 --> 05:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
floor over to Mr Joseph quas Mr Quik you
 
05:40:26.910 --> 05:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
have the floor for two
 
05:40:30.670 --> 05:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
minutes uh thank you Mr chairman and I
 
05:40:31.788 --> 05:40:31.798 align:start position:0%
promise this will be the last time
 
05:40:32.990 --> 05:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from me
 
05:40:36.510 --> 05:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
today um I'm testifying in support of
 
05:40:37.670 --> 05:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
one67 uh- FN and this bill um positively
 
05:40:45.750 --> 05:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
improves the U amount of uh increases in
 
05:40:47.548 --> 05:40:47.558 align:start position:0%
the the size of the generators that can
 
05:40:49.910 --> 05:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
actually be net Meed eventually getting
 
05:40:52.468 --> 05:40:52.478 align:start position:0%
back up to almost five megawatts on and
 
05:40:56.230 --> 05:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
after January 1 2002 it also specifies
 
05:40:59.830 --> 05:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
the um the um the amount of net miring
 
05:41:01.830 --> 05:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
that can be provided by a particular
 
05:41:04.628 --> 05:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
Source in that only at least 50% of the
 
05:41:07.070 --> 05:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
actual uh generation must be consumed
 
05:41:08.670 --> 05:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
behind the meter so I think that's an
 
05:41:11.628 --> 05:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
improvement on previous bills I do think
 
05:41:14.708 --> 05:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
that um this bill needs to pass as it is
 
05:41:16.230 --> 05:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
expected to encourage the building of
 
05:41:18.468 --> 05:41:18.478 align:start position:0%
more and larger New Hampshire renewable
 
05:41:20.830 --> 05:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
energy projects such projects will
 
05:41:22.708 --> 05:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
reduce electric load obligations for the
 
05:41:24.830 --> 05:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers in New Hampshire
 
05:41:27.390 --> 05:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
reduce electric transmission costs keep
 
05:41:28.948 --> 05:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
our energy dollars within New Hampshire
 
05:41:30.390 --> 05:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
reduce red the carbon and pollution
 
05:41:32.310 --> 05:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
signature of electricity consumed in New
 
05:41:34.670 --> 05:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it make crystal clear that
 
05:41:36.510 --> 05:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
debt metering compensation for larger
 
05:41:37.948 --> 05:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
customer generators will be set at the
 
05:41:40.270 --> 05:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
applicable default Energy Service rate
 
05:41:42.948 --> 05:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
of its utility supplier in addition as
 
05:41:45.590 --> 05:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
I've said before these valued assets to
 
05:41:47.948 --> 05:41:47.958 align:start position:0%
the grid will continue to increase in
 
05:41:50.590 --> 05:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
support a reliable and more resilient
 
05:41:53.910 --> 05:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
electrical G grid into the future uh and
 
05:41:55.990 --> 05:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
that uh is the end of my comments I will
 
05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
take CEST
 
05:41:58.160 --> 05:41:59.868 align:start position:0%
take CEST
questions

05:41:59.868 --> 05:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:42:01.868 --> 05:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
thank you one minute 22 seconds any
 
05:42:04.230 --> 05:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative sset you
 
05:42:05.548 --> 05:42:05.558 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:42:11.868 --> 05:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
Mr pnik for taking my my question uh
 
05:42:13.590 --> 05:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
just because previously we had a
 
05:42:15.948 --> 05:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
question about uh how would this impact
 
05:42:20.270 --> 05:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
rate payers in New Hampshire um could
 
05:42:23.510 --> 05:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
you say something about the issue of
 
05:42:26.788 --> 05:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
volatility in the fuel cost markets
 
05:42:29.750 --> 05:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
because when we look in the future rapay
 
05:42:31.590 --> 05:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be affective by the cost of
 
05:42:33.830 --> 05:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
fuel and we know that in the winter time
 
05:42:36.310 --> 05:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
especially in the past we've seen large
 
05:42:39.270 --> 05:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
variations in the fuel prices how does
 
05:42:41.230 --> 05:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
uh this kind of energy the renewable
 
05:42:43.468 --> 05:42:43.478 align:start position:0%
energy sources you're talking about how
 
05:42:47.190 --> 05:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
does that impact long-term our fuel cost
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
well as as everyone realizes um if we're
 
05:42:51.310 --> 05:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
talking about renewable energy
 
05:42:54.510 --> 05:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
specifically solar or wind uh those
 
05:42:56.430 --> 05:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
resources are essentially free you don't
 
05:42:59.468 --> 05:42:59.478 align:start position:0%
have to pay for uh BTUs of either coal
 
05:43:02.548 --> 05:43:02.558 align:start position:0%
or gas or oil so the fuel cost is
 
05:43:06.590 --> 05:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
essentially um zero so that's not volle
 
05:43:08.868 --> 05:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
depending on the season uh and we do
 
05:43:12.590 --> 05:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
know that as New England depends um uh
 
05:43:15.070 --> 05:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
has lost I think all except one C
 
05:43:16.830 --> 05:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
burning power plants depending more and
 
05:43:20.990 --> 05:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
more on um natural gas supplies for uh
 
05:43:22.548 --> 05:43:22.558 align:start position:0%
much of its energy coming and for New
 
05:43:24.310 --> 05:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire coming from out of the state
 
05:43:25.948 --> 05:43:25.958 align:start position:0%
and we know looking at what's happening
 
05:43:28.868 --> 05:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
in in uh in Texas is that uh gas prices
 
05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
can can be very volatile in the winter
 
05:43:33.310 --> 05:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
and also there are issues about gas
 
05:43:36.628 --> 05:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
supply U especially when uh generators
 
05:43:39.990 --> 05:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
such as in in Texas uh did not have firm
 
05:43:42.468 --> 05:43:42.478 align:start position:0%
contracts for their gas and they found
 
05:43:44.230 --> 05:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
that their gas actually went up to the
 
05:43:46.468 --> 05:43:46.478 align:start position:0%
firm customers uh in the area of home
 
05:43:48.590 --> 05:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
heatings and things of that sort and I
 
05:43:51.190 --> 05:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
know that in New England some of the gas
 
05:43:53.350 --> 05:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
generators uh some of their some of
 
05:43:54.910 --> 05:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
their gas supply is certainly firm
 
05:43:57.150 --> 05:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
contracts and a lot of it is also
 
05:43:59.350 --> 05:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
non-firm contracts so there's some
 
05:44:01.270 --> 05:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
volatility there and also supply issues
 
05:44:04.510 --> 05:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
that need to be uh reflected uh in the
 
05:44:07.110 --> 05:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
planning for capacity within New England
 
05:44:08.708 --> 05:44:08.718 align:start position:0%
during those
 
05:44:11.628 --> 05:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
Seasons thank
 
05:44:14.708 --> 05:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative pintel as
 
05:44:18.310 --> 05:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:21.910 --> 05:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman uh
 
05:44:26.990 --> 05:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:29.628 --> 05:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
quas there's a saying
 
05:44:32.750 --> 05:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't put all your eggs in one basket
 
05:44:37.750 --> 05:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
could you explain to me how this uh use
 
05:44:39.708 --> 05:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
of net
 
05:44:42.468 --> 05:44:42.478 align:start position:0%
metering uh how that increases the
 
05:44:44.910 --> 05:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
number of baskets and how that will
 
05:44:48.150 --> 05:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
actually improve our overall
 
05:44:50.070 --> 05:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure yeah I think we also have
 
05:44:52.628 --> 05:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
to recognize that net metering currently
 
05:44:54.628 --> 05:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
as it's understood in New Hampshire is
 
05:44:57.150 --> 05:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
load reduction it's not considered uh
 
05:44:59.430 --> 05:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
Supply but it does
 
05:45:01.510 --> 05:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh as we've learned in the past it does
 
05:45:04.310 --> 05:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
reduce the demand on the system um it
 
05:45:06.150 --> 05:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
also uh reduces the amount of energy
 
05:45:07.788 --> 05:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
needs to be imported from out of state
 
05:45:09.948 --> 05:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
so that is all good for consumers in New
 
05:45:12.510 --> 05:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but also um in general uh
 
05:45:14.708 --> 05:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
having a diversified energy resource
 
05:45:17.910 --> 05:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
base is good for uh for consumers in the
 
05:45:19.390 --> 05:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
state whether it's a combination of
 
05:45:21.628 --> 05:45:21.638 align:start position:0%
nuclear and we're lucky to have one in
 
05:45:24.430 --> 05:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
the state a combination of um of gas
 
05:45:26.830 --> 05:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
plants uh I think there's a few here and
 
05:45:29.270 --> 05:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
and certainly out of state uh some of
 
05:45:31.150 --> 05:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
the large wind turbines are providing
 
05:45:34.270 --> 05:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
base load within New Hampshire and um as
 
05:45:38.070 --> 05:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
we learned today there are two utility
 
05:45:42.070 --> 05:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
scale uh uh solar plants one uh and the
 
05:45:44.270 --> 05:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
one I'm familiar was the 2 megawatt unit
 
05:45:45.750 --> 05:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's owned and operated by New
 
05:45:49.110 --> 05:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um uh Electric Co-op those are
 
05:45:51.030 --> 05:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
actually feeding into the system they're
 
05:45:53.788 --> 05:45:53.798 align:start position:0%
not n metered they're actually um
 
05:45:56.230 --> 05:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
sending it basically supplying into the
 
05:45:58.390 --> 05:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
system for instance in that case for the
 
05:46:00.868 --> 05:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
the electric co-ops uh uh load
 
05:46:06.230 --> 05:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:10.310 --> 05:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:12.830 --> 05:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you uh I have
 
05:46:14.990 --> 05:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
a question for you Mr frik you just
 
05:46:18.788 --> 05:46:18.798 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um load
 
05:46:18.798 --> 05:46:21.030 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um load
reduction

05:46:21.030 --> 05:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
if if a load reduction source is
 
05:46:30.190 --> 05:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
intermittent how can it be counted on uh
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
to be genuine load reduction
 
05:46:37.510 --> 05:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
who who figures out what part of the
 
05:46:39.590 --> 05:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
load has been reduced and
 
05:46:41.868 --> 05:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
when well I think I'd like to go back to
 
05:46:45.708 --> 05:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
the comment that um Miss Mano uh talked
 
05:46:48.230 --> 05:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
about today is that ISO New England has
 
05:46:50.708 --> 05:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
very sophisticated forecasting of uh
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
formulas and they have a very great
 
05:46:56.190 --> 05:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
understanding of how the weather uh in
 
05:46:58.948 --> 05:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
solar insulation demand and other
 
05:47:01.548 --> 05:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
factors can be actually calculated and
 
05:47:04.510 --> 05:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
and uh predicted in terms of what uh
 
05:47:06.110 --> 05:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
these load reduction sources will
 
05:47:08.510 --> 05:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
actually provide in the day ahead market
 
05:47:11.150 --> 05:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
so uh although it seems like they're uh
 
05:47:13.590 --> 05:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
they're here or or not here they
 
05:47:16.190 --> 05:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
actually in aggregate uh provide uh some
 
05:47:18.110 --> 05:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
necessary resources that are counted on
 
05:47:21.350 --> 05:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:25.628 --> 05:47:25.638 align:start position:0%
England so are ISO New England's
 
05:47:28.868 --> 05:47:28.878 align:start position:0%
forecasting facilities better than the
 
05:47:30.948 --> 05:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
TV weatherman who only gets it right
 
05:47:35.190 --> 05:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
maybe 50 or 60% of the time um I'm I'm
 
05:47:38.270 --> 05:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
not an econometrist uh in in in
 
05:47:39.948 --> 05:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
predicting that but I understand that
 
05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:48.030 --> 05:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
record okay representative Stitch is
 
05:47:50.670 --> 05:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question uh thank you
 
05:47:54.628 --> 05:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
Mr uh chairman if I may just add a
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
comment as information to uh the issue
 
05:47:59.150 --> 05:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
of the load reduction and
 
05:48:01.548 --> 05:48:01.558 align:start position:0%
predictability um it's interesting to
 
05:48:04.390 --> 05:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
note that in Europe Spain for example
 
05:48:07.190 --> 05:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
that generates a lot of solar energy has
 
05:48:10.310 --> 05:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
a very sophisticated predictive program
 
05:48:12.910 --> 05:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
where it allows it to export its energy
 
05:48:16.070 --> 05:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
into markets in France because they're
 
05:48:18.070 --> 05:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
interconnected and there of course
 
05:48:20.628 --> 05:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
France doesn't have as much sun as Spain
 
05:48:23.948 --> 05:48:23.958 align:start position:0%
does but this is a a really important
 
05:48:26.070 --> 05:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
aspect because right now we can see what
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
happens with Texas their grid is not not
 
05:48:31.310 --> 05:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
connected to anyone else so they can't
 
05:48:33.430 --> 05:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
be getting help from other other
 
05:48:36.510 --> 05:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
networks when they need it
 
05:48:40.110 --> 05:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
so no I'm sorry just a comment thank you
 
05:48:41.350 --> 05:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank
 
05:48:45.670 --> 05:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you Mr Quik for your
 
05:48:48.350 --> 05:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you see no other
 
05:48:51.948 --> 05:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr plaznik I will turn to
 
05:48:54.548 --> 05:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
our next
 
05:48:56.788 --> 05:48:56.798 align:start position:0%

for three
 
05:49:10.708 --> 05:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you can you hear me we can
 
05:49:13.628 --> 05:49:13.638 align:start position:0%
thank you all right dear chairman Vose
 
05:49:15.270 --> 05:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
05:49:16.868 --> 05:49:16.878 align:start position:0%

consumers while leveraging and
 
05:49:44.468 --> 05:49:44.478 align:start position:0%
supporting the development of

the continued reductions of all
 
05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
Emissions on behalf of CA I want to
 
05:49:53.230 --> 05:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to provide
 
05:49:55.948 --> 05:49:55.958 align:start position:0%
this testimony today on
 
05:49:58.708 --> 05:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
hb67 DEA supports New Hampshire amilies
 
05:50:00.190 --> 05:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
and businesses making investments in
 
05:50:01.510 --> 05:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
generation that will allow them to
 
05:50:03.708 --> 05:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
produce their own power and even sell
 
05:50:06.030 --> 05:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
that excess generation back to the grid
 
05:50:07.788 --> 05:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
there's no legislative or regulatory
 
05:50:09.628 --> 05:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
hurdle prohibiting this from happening
 
05:50:12.110 --> 05:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
now the issue is at what price should
 
05:50:13.590 --> 05:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
they be paid for the exported
 
05:50:16.070 --> 05:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
electricity the retail default energy
 
05:50:18.468 --> 05:50:18.478 align:start position:0%
rate which represents the fully bundled
 
05:50:20.830 --> 05:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
energy rate including firm energy
 
05:50:23.670 --> 05:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
capacity risk premiums and is currently
 
05:50:26.430 --> 05:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
roughly 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour but
 
05:50:28.548 --> 05:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
that varies depending on the solicit
 
05:50:31.150 --> 05:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
ation period or the avoided cost rate
 
05:50:32.590 --> 05:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
authorized under the public utilities
 
05:50:34.430 --> 05:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory Policy Act and set by the New
 
05:50:36.468 --> 05:50:36.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Utilities Commission
 
05:50:38.670 --> 05:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
which was approximately three cents in
 
05:50:41.070 --> 05:50:41.080 align:start position:0%
2020 is often argued that New Hampshire
 
05:50:42.628 --> 05:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
should support expanded retail net
 
05:50:44.628 --> 05:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
metering programs in order to reduce the
 
05:50:46.430 --> 05:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
state share of the regional network
 
05:50:49.990 --> 05:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
service AKA transmission charges what we
 
05:50:51.670 --> 05:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
have not seen is empirical evidence
 
05:50:53.150 --> 05:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
showing that the increased cost of
 
05:50:55.628 --> 05:50:55.638 align:start position:0%
adopting retail net metering programs
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
like paying twice the market rate for
 
05:50:59.548 --> 05:50:59.558 align:start position:0%
generation increased risk premiums to
 
05:51:02.070 --> 05:51:02.080 align:start position:0%

PV adopters are wealthy the net effect
 
05:52:14.310 --> 05:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
is that average expenditures for

there from the advancement of their

programs um has called for an
 
05:52:50.670 --> 05:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
investigation at the Pu so there's uh
 
05:52:53.230 --> 05:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
inmation I think the best thing to do is
 
05:52:55.788 --> 05:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
to uh you know let the Pu conclude its
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
study before we start expanding that
 
05:52:58.990 --> 05:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
meter and cost
 
05:52:59.000 --> 05:53:00.310 align:start position:0%
meter and cost
thank

05:53:00.310 --> 05:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:53:03.628 --> 05:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony the
 
05:53:05.190 --> 05:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
05:53:09.390 --> 05:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:11.468 --> 05:53:11.478 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:53:13.788 --> 05:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I I I just want
 
05:53:15.510 --> 05:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure what I heard I think the
 
05:53:16.948 --> 05:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
most important part of what you just
 
05:53:19.510 --> 05:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
stated is that there's a vast difference
 
05:53:22.270 --> 05:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
between what makes up default service
 
05:53:24.030 --> 05:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
and what makes up the avoided cost for
 
05:53:26.708 --> 05:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
the utility is that correct yeah the
 
05:53:29.948 --> 05:53:29.958 align:start position:0%
default Services it's air firm product
 
05:53:33.350 --> 05:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay you know so when you what you pay
 
05:53:35.110 --> 05:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
for your default Energy Service rate is
 
05:53:38.270 --> 05:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
fully bundled it's firm energy capacity
 
05:53:40.510 --> 05:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
ancillary Services you know the
 
05:53:43.468 --> 05:53:43.478 align:start position:0%
administrative cost RPS you know all of
 
05:53:47.150 --> 05:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
that bundled in the avoided cost is for
 
05:53:49.708 --> 05:53:49.718 align:start position:0%
energy which is what is provided by
 
05:53:52.110 --> 05:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
distributed generation it's it's
 
05:53:53.708 --> 05:53:53.718 align:start position:0%
intermittent it's not dispatchable right
 
05:53:56.750 --> 05:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
nobody knows when it's you know coming
 
05:53:59.430 --> 05:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
from a home so
 
05:53:59.440 --> 05:54:01.990 align:start position:0%
from a home so
thank

05:54:01.990 --> 05:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:05.750 --> 05:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
you you need a followup representative
 
05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
Harrington no I'm all set thank you okay
 
05:54:13.750 --> 05:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
great uh any additional questions for um

Brown seeing
 
05:54:25.670 --> 05:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
none uh that will
 
05:54:28.788 --> 05:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
conclude Our Testimony un l unless Mr
 
05:54:30.340 --> 05:54:30.350 align:start position:0%
Belo has

05:54:45.910 --> 05:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
has no one uh has their hand up so it
 
05:54:49.390 --> 05:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
appears that we have concluded testimony
 
05:54:49.400 --> 05:54:50.708 align:start position:0%
appears that we have concluded testimony
on

05:54:50.708 --> 05:54:50.718 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:54:53.910 --> 05:54:53.920 align:start position:0%

hearing and uh I thank you all for being
 
05:54:59.350 --> 05:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
here there were 100 41 people who signed
 
05:55:01.868 --> 05:55:01.878 align:start position:0%
up support to support this bill and two
 
05:55:03.830 --> 05:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
people who signed up to oppose it and
 
05:55:08.548 --> 05:55:08.558 align:start position:0%
two people who signed in as being
 
05:55:12.030 --> 05:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
neutral so with that uh closure of that
 
05:55:15.430 --> 05:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing we can
 
05:55:20.390 --> 05:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
now resume some exact session
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
activity I would like to open the exec
 
05:55:26.430 --> 05:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:30.548 --> 05:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
373 and uh recognize representative n
 
05:55:31.430 --> 05:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:55:35.070 --> 05:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
motion I oh are you sure you want me to
 
05:55:41.830 --> 05:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:44.948 --> 05:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
chairman point of order Mr
 
05:55:47.510 --> 05:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
chairman yes representative McGee what's
 
05:55:50.788 --> 05:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
your question thank you chairman um you
 
05:55:52.390 --> 05:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
had mentioned earlier that there was an
 
05:55:54.430 --> 05:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and it was distributed I
 
05:55:55.868 --> 05:55:55.878 align:start position:0%
believe but we haven't even discussed
 
05:55:58.468 --> 05:55:58.478 align:start position:0%
the amendment so are you
 
05:56:00.670 --> 05:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
moving to a vote without even discussing
 
05:56:02.830 --> 05:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
what's been added to the
 
05:56:05.548 --> 05:56:05.558 align:start position:0%
bill yes my understanding of the prop
 
05:56:08.628 --> 05:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
proper procedure is that you uh make a
 
05:56:12.990 --> 05:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
motion to ought to pass then you ask if
 
05:56:15.190 --> 05:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
there are any
 
05:56:18.468 --> 05:56:18.478 align:start position:0%
further um motions to consider and if
 
05:56:20.628 --> 05:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
someone has an amendment then they will
 
05:56:24.590 --> 05:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
move to uh pass the amendment then on
 
05:56:28.350 --> 05:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
once that's done then you move to ought
 
05:56:31.030 --> 05:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended that's my
 
05:56:34.990 --> 05:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
recollection of how the process works
 
05:56:36.708 --> 05:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a different
 
05:56:36.718 --> 05:56:39.830 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a different
M

05:56:39.830 --> 05:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:44.190 --> 05:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
no okay so representative uh call fist

05:57:28.910 --> 05:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment
 
05:57:30.910 --> 05:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
yes once we once we
 
05:57:34.230 --> 05:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
establish that we uh that the exec
 
05:57:37.430 --> 05:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
session is open this is relative to
 
05:57:39.468 --> 05:57:39.478 align:start position:0%
State participation in low carbon fuel
 
05:57:39.478 --> 05:57:40.830 align:start position:0%
State participation in low carbon fuel
standards

05:57:40.830 --> 05:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
standards
 
05:57:44.110 --> 05:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
programs the name of the the bill once
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
we establish that
 
05:57:48.948 --> 05:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
we are in executive mode on this then
 
05:57:53.868 --> 05:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:56.590 --> 05:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
motions so representative ner do you
 
05:57:59.590 --> 05:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
have a motion yes I'm Mo ought to pass
 
05:58:01.990 --> 05:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay with Amendment representative
 
05:58:04.548 --> 05:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
bernardy and will second that motion
 
05:58:07.350 --> 05:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion to ought to
 
05:58:12.270 --> 05:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
pass on HB 373 are there any additional
 
05:58:14.868 --> 05:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
motions that are appropriate
 
05:58:18.510 --> 05:58:18.520 align:start position:0%

Amendment

05:58:40.420 --> 05:58:40.430 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:40.430 --> 05:58:57.708 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:58:57.708 --> 05:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:00.590 --> 05:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative on a Case by case basis I
 
05:59:03.110 --> 05:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
believe this would give the governor or
 
05:59:04.750 --> 05:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
the representative which in this case
 
05:59:07.150 --> 05:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
could be the department Department of
 
05:59:11.468 --> 05:59:11.478 align:start position:0%
energy uh the latitude that if they hear
 
05:59:14.430 --> 05:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
of a particular subject coming up on
 
05:59:16.430 --> 05:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
this item that they want to have eyes
 
05:59:19.190 --> 05:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
and ears there to at least listen that
 
05:59:22.830 --> 05:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
they can on a meeting by meeting basis
 
05:59:26.070 --> 05:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
approve uh someone from Dees to go down
 
05:59:28.548 --> 05:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
there and to listen I think this gives
 
05:59:32.590 --> 05:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
latitude to the governor to to provide
 
05:59:34.110 --> 05:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
this type of service that's all this
 
05:59:37.310 --> 05:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment is meant to do and they
 
05:59:39.548 --> 05:59:39.558 align:start position:0%
would have to be specifically requested
 
05:59:42.310 --> 05:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
by this person to go down for for that
 
05:59:45.750 --> 05:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
particular meeting um to go down there
 
05:59:48.548 --> 05:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
and listen any other meetings would come
 
05:59:52.190 --> 05:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
up the same direct that have asked again
 
05:59:53.868 --> 05:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
so do you move the adoption of this
 
05:59:57.150 --> 05:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
amendment and I move that we adopt this
 
05:59:59.070 --> 05:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
amendment I have a question
 
05:59:59.080 --> 06:00:00.990 align:start position:0%
amendment I have a question
representative

06:00:00.990 --> 06:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:00:04.590 --> 06:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
Harrington to recognize to second the
 
06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
motion I second the motion okay thank
 
06:00:11.708 --> 06:00:11.718 align:start position:0%
you uh for discussion representative ner
 
06:00:14.110 --> 06:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
thank you does it say who the designated
 
06:00:16.948 --> 06:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
representative will be or how it will be
 
06:00:20.468 --> 06:00:20.478 align:start position:0%
decided no it
 
06:00:24.468 --> 06:00:24.478 align:start position:0%
doesn't would be my assumption that if
 
06:00:26.110 --> 06:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
not directly from the governor that it
 
06:00:29.270 --> 06:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
might come from his new uh office of
 
06:00:31.788 --> 06:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
energy but since we don't know who that
 
06:00:34.270 --> 06:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
is or how it's going to be formed yet
 
06:00:37.708 --> 06:00:37.718 align:start position:0%
this Le kind of General be his the
 
06:00:37.718 --> 06:00:39.190 align:start position:0%

design representative representative
 
06:00:44.750 --> 06:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
Cali pitz you have a question for
 
06:00:48.708 --> 06:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
discussion yes I do I I first first I
 
06:00:51.868 --> 06:00:51.878 align:start position:0%
had a point of order a representative n
 
06:00:54.788 --> 06:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
introduced the bills is she was she
 
06:00:56.430 --> 06:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
permitted to ask
 
06:00:59.030 --> 06:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
questions the amendment on an amendment
 
06:01:02.468 --> 06:01:02.478 align:start position:0%
yes I think she but she the motion on
 
06:01:06.310 --> 06:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
the floor was to pass the bill so I I'm
 
06:01:08.230 --> 06:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
gonna just question that I don't usually
 
06:01:10.510 --> 06:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
question the chair I'm going to question
 
06:01:14.230 --> 06:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
that she might be right I'm sorry I
 
06:01:16.868 --> 06:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
right representative Kelly I might be
 
06:01:20.230 --> 06:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
the other question I had was to uh
 
06:01:22.948 --> 06:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas do you think that
 
06:01:26.430 --> 06:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
this particular amendment is
 
06:01:29.230 --> 06:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
micromanaging the
 
06:01:33.590 --> 06:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
dees and and not allowing them to follow
 
06:01:36.868 --> 06:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
the expertise that we have invested them
 
06:01:39.230 --> 06:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
or think they
 
06:01:43.030 --> 06:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
have well I believe that in this
 
06:01:46.590 --> 06:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
particular case um in trying to
 
06:01:49.868 --> 06:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
improve the orinal bill in itself and
 
06:01:52.190 --> 06:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
also the fact that we now are getting a
 
06:01:56.190 --> 06:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
new Department of energy um there there
 
06:01:58.070 --> 06:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
there may be situations
 
06:02:00.910 --> 06:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
where we would want the department of
 
06:02:05.030 --> 06:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
energy or Governor to um decide if we're
 
06:02:08.190 --> 06:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
going to spend State money I'm going to
 
06:02:10.670 --> 06:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
witness listen in our programs that
 
06:02:12.590 --> 06:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
worker stated that we're not going to
 
06:02:15.670 --> 06:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
actually do but we may want someone
 
06:02:18.430 --> 06:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
there and I think I think a decision
 
06:02:21.868 --> 06:02:21.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:25.150 --> 06:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
up of stuff coming at me may I follow
 
06:02:27.868 --> 06:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
up yes follow up
 
06:02:30.110 --> 06:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay you just you just mentioned the
 
06:02:33.468 --> 06:02:33.478 align:start position:0%
department of energy Board of
 
06:02:36.390 --> 06:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
Governors I I guess I've never heard of
 
06:02:39.628 --> 06:02:39.638 align:start position:0%
a department that had to go to a Board
 
06:02:42.030 --> 06:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
of Governors to do anything and maybe
 
06:02:43.910 --> 06:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's just my fault because my ears
 
06:02:46.190 --> 06:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
haven't been open and who is the Board
 
06:02:48.868 --> 06:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
of Governors I I I believe that's a
 
06:02:52.110 --> 06:02:52.120 align:start position:0%
result of me not enunciating completely
 
06:02:55.510 --> 06:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
and clearly I what I was saying was that
 
06:02:58.350 --> 06:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
it could be up to the uh Department of
 
06:03:02.230 --> 06:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
energy who whoever that might be or the
 
06:03:05.628 --> 06:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
governor's Representatives okay we just
 
06:03:08.590 --> 06:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
don't know who that is and and I believe
 
06:03:11.430 --> 06:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
that uh in a situation like this I think
 
06:03:14.310 --> 06:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's up to the governor or his designate
 
06:03:16.948 --> 06:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
his designate to decide when to spend
 
06:03:19.310 --> 06:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
State money on programs that we know
 
06:03:20.868 --> 06:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
we're not supporting but we may want to
 
06:03:22.430 --> 06:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
send someone down there to hallucinate
 
06:03:25.190 --> 06:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
on a Case by case
 
06:03:29.350 --> 06:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
basis I know I'm limited to go
 
06:03:31.910 --> 06:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you representative what is
 
06:03:33.708 --> 06:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
the amendment number please the
 
06:03:39.670 --> 06:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:43.270 --> 06:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
d455 thank you yes representative oxims
 
06:03:46.030 --> 06:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question or a
 
06:03:48.150 --> 06:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
statement thank you very much for
 
06:03:50.750 --> 06:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
allowing me to go beyond a question I
 
06:03:53.030 --> 06:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
finding great difficulty with this bill
 
06:03:56.030 --> 06:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
and the amendment does not help at all
 
06:03:59.868 --> 06:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
the concept that we would not want our
 
06:04:02.110 --> 06:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
staff members whether it's Dees or the
 
06:04:04.310 --> 06:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
new Department of energy to have the
 
06:04:07.548 --> 06:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
fullest possible communication with the
 
06:04:10.430 --> 06:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
people who share the grid with us who
 
06:04:15.190 --> 06:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
share the the interests of our residents
 
06:04:17.230 --> 06:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
of our citizens of our
 
06:04:20.830 --> 06:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
businesses it it it just defies any
 
06:04:23.628 --> 06:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
imagine can can you give me any reason
 
06:04:28.750 --> 06:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
why you would want to impose a gag order
 
06:04:31.310 --> 06:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
isolate our staff from the staff of
 
06:04:34.548 --> 06:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
other states other individuals
 
06:04:36.990 --> 06:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
businesses Cooperative organizations
 
06:04:39.788 --> 06:04:39.798 align:start position:0%
that could help us to do things in the
 
06:04:44.350 --> 06:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
best possible most coste effective
 
06:04:47.830 --> 06:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
way representative
 
06:04:50.750 --> 06:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
Thomas question well that was a question
 
06:04:53.030 --> 06:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
it may have been rhetorical it seems to
 
06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
me that the
 
06:04:58.590 --> 06:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
amendment uh takes away a gag order
 
06:04:59.948 --> 06:04:59.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't impose
 
06:05:03.590 --> 06:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
one representative pel you recognized
 
06:05:05.628 --> 06:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
for a question excuse me am I not going
 
06:05:07.708 --> 06:05:07.718 align:start position:0%
to get an answer that the amendment only
 
06:05:09.910 --> 06:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
says you can do it in when we on a
 
06:05:12.750 --> 06:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
caseby casee basis it doesn't stop the
 
06:05:17.190 --> 06:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:20.750 --> 06:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
rule I will glad to restate my reason
 
06:05:24.990 --> 06:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
again which is on a program such as uh
 
06:05:27.788 --> 06:05:27.798 align:start position:0%
such as this where the state where the
 
06:05:29.510 --> 06:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
governor has said we will not
 
06:05:33.070 --> 06:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
participate in it I believe that it is
 
06:05:36.310 --> 06:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
up to the governor or the designated or
 
06:05:40.270 --> 06:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
he does me to decide when to send people
 
06:05:43.868 --> 06:05:43.878 align:start position:0%
to a program that we are have already
 
06:05:46.190 --> 06:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
said that we are not going to support
 
06:05:48.150 --> 06:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
but we might want someone here to listen
 
06:05:50.390 --> 06:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
in on what's going on and that should be
 
06:05:53.430 --> 06:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
on a Case by case basis I personally
 
06:05:55.190 --> 06:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
believe that on programs that we are
 
06:05:57.430 --> 06:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
participating in then it's to the
 
06:05:59.350 --> 06:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
department heads to decide they want to
 
06:06:02.110 --> 06:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
go to help out the states in those in in
 
06:06:03.788 --> 06:06:03.798 align:start position:0%
that program
 
06:06:06.628 --> 06:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
so I just so this bill is about the
 
06:06:10.590 --> 06:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:13.910 --> 06:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
initiative uh point of order Mr
 
06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
chairman representative ssuch what's
 
06:06:18.230 --> 06:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
your point of order well I would like to
 
06:06:20.590 --> 06:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
have some clarification about exactly
 
06:06:23.548 --> 06:06:23.558 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here uh so I uh
 
06:06:25.830 --> 06:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas introduces an
 
06:06:28.868 --> 06:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
amendment uh are we treating him like a
 
06:06:32.510 --> 06:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
witness so we ask questions or do do we
 
06:06:36.350 --> 06:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
discuss the content of this bill as such
 
06:06:40.350 --> 06:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
and merits of it pro and con uh you've
 
06:06:41.990 --> 06:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
had different rules for different
 
06:06:44.310 --> 06:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
procedures so I'd like to know what what
 
06:06:46.110 --> 06:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
procedure are we in right
 
06:06:49.788 --> 06:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
now we're discussing the adoption of
 
06:06:52.708 --> 06:06:52.718 align:start position:0%
amendment 202-
 
06:06:56.150 --> 06:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
0558 so so we are we not limited to
 
06:06:58.510 --> 06:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
questions we can make comments and our
 
06:07:01.910 --> 06:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
and and and uh voice our opinions about
 
06:07:04.708 --> 06:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
the amendment is that correct is correct
 
06:07:06.350 --> 06:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
 
06:07:09.948 --> 06:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
much okay representative pintel is
 
06:07:12.070 --> 06:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
recognized to
 
06:07:15.230 --> 06:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
speak uh so it it's very difficult for
 
06:07:19.310 --> 06:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
me to understand what the rationale
 
06:07:21.230 --> 06:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
for not
 
06:07:23.910 --> 06:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
allowing uh people in
 
06:07:28.430 --> 06:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
Dees to be able to listen to be able to
 
06:07:31.868 --> 06:07:31.878 align:start position:0%
learn I'm not talking part participating
 
06:07:34.868 --> 06:07:34.878 align:start position:0%
they don't not have to be participating
 
06:07:36.788 --> 06:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
but to listen and
 
06:07:40.830 --> 06:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
learn why are we gagging that ability to
 
06:07:45.110 --> 06:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
listen and learn to report it just makes
 
06:07:47.788 --> 06:07:47.798 align:start position:0%
no sense to me at all and if you don't
 
06:07:50.548 --> 06:07:50.558 align:start position:0%
call it a i you can't call it anything
 
06:07:52.910 --> 06:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
other than a gag order it's just that
 
06:07:55.830 --> 06:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:55.840 --> 06:07:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
simple

06:07:58.310 --> 06:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
simple
 
06:08:01.190 --> 06:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay next
 
06:08:08.430 --> 06:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:11.948 --> 06:08:11.958 align:start position:0%
comment unmute button uh thank you
 
06:08:15.190 --> 06:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
chairman um I really want to Echo the
 
06:08:18.628 --> 06:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
thoughts of uh my my colleague saying I
 
06:08:21.708 --> 06:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
I feel like this is a very specific bill
 
06:08:26.270 --> 06:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
um really micromanaging the the de um
 
06:08:28.948 --> 06:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit concerned that we are
 
06:08:32.430 --> 06:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
giving this level of specificity to the
 
06:08:34.868 --> 06:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
governor um
 
06:08:40.070 --> 06:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
to yeah to control um where the dees uh
 
06:08:42.990 --> 06:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
May participate in discussions or not it
 
06:08:45.430 --> 06:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
just seems um like this is something
 
06:08:47.548 --> 06:08:47.558 align:start position:0%
that really should just be best left to
 
06:08:50.230 --> 06:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
to Dees um not something that the
 
06:08:53.230 --> 06:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
governor needs to get
 
06:08:55.910 --> 06:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
into thank you representative the chair
 
06:08:58.110 --> 06:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative man for a
 
06:09:01.590 --> 06:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
comment yes thank you Mr chairman
 
06:09:05.708 --> 06:09:05.718 align:start position:0%
um the air Resources Division of
 
06:09:10.190 --> 06:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
um of U Dees has long been interested in
 
06:09:13.868 --> 06:09:13.878 align:start position:0%
air quality and I I cannot see this bill
 
06:09:15.270 --> 06:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
having any
 
06:09:19.510 --> 06:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
purpose uh and I perfectly happy to be
 
06:09:24.310 --> 06:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
corrected any purpose other than uh to
 
06:09:27.230 --> 06:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
prevent uh opposing opinions from
 
06:09:29.430 --> 06:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
getting in the way of
 
06:09:32.510 --> 06:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
U policies that are interested
 
06:09:37.070 --> 06:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
in that might be uh you know let's put
 
06:09:38.990 --> 06:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
it this way I don't understand why we
 
06:09:43.110 --> 06:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
would not allow and not even require the
 
06:09:44.910 --> 06:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities
 
06:09:48.310 --> 06:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
Commission excuse me the uh Dees air
 
06:09:51.510 --> 06:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
Resources Division to sit on sit in on
 
06:09:54.548 --> 06:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
any discussion they want to or they feel
 
06:09:57.708 --> 06:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
is appropriate for that relates to air
 
06:09:59.990 --> 06:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
quality because that is the mission of
 
06:10:01.948 --> 06:10:01.958 align:start position:0%
the air Resources
 
06:10:04.948 --> 06:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
Division and it
 
06:10:08.030 --> 06:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
um certainly makes me scratch my head as
 
06:10:10.750 --> 06:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
to why this is going on thank
 
06:10:13.548 --> 06:10:13.558 align:start position:0%
you thank you the chair recognizes
 
06:10:16.430 --> 06:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative McGee for a
 
06:10:21.350 --> 06:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
comment thank you chairman um I I I'd
 
06:10:24.070 --> 06:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
like to take us back to testimony when
 
06:10:26.070 --> 06:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
we were listening to 373 since we're
 
06:10:30.468 --> 06:10:30.478 align:start position:0%
discussing it now in exec and um we
 
06:10:32.708 --> 06:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from Greg Moore of
 
06:10:35.468 --> 06:10:35.478 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity that the
 
06:10:37.708 --> 06:10:37.718 align:start position:0%
transportation climate initiative was
 
06:10:37.718 --> 06:10:39.110 align:start position:0%
transportation climate initiative was
the

06:10:39.110 --> 06:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:10:42.030 --> 06:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
precipitating uh Regional issue that was
 
06:10:45.670 --> 06:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
ongoing that had spurred this bill and
 
06:10:47.670 --> 06:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
yet the governor had already given
 
06:10:50.230 --> 06:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
instructions to the Department of
 
06:10:53.948 --> 06:10:53.958 align:start position:0%
energy uh and their you know air air
 
06:10:56.270 --> 06:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
quality division as to the level of
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
partic ipation that was required so the
 
06:11:00.868 --> 06:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
executive is already in charge of this
 
06:11:03.430 --> 06:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
department and if there is an energy
 
06:11:05.590 --> 06:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
Department there will be an additional
 
06:11:10.150 --> 06:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
layer of authority over environmental
 
06:11:12.830 --> 06:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
services that is basically under the
 
06:11:15.230 --> 06:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
executive so I really think that this
 
06:11:19.468 --> 06:11:19.478 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't do anything because as as I
 
06:11:21.270 --> 06:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
said the governor had made the decision
 
06:11:23.430 --> 06:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
that we're not part of TCI and he also
 
06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
instructed Dees on the level of
 
06:11:27.070 --> 06:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
participation that they were allowed to
 
06:11:30.708 --> 06:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
do so this bill is unnecessary and so I
 
06:11:33.150 --> 06:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
think the ought to pass motion that's on
 
06:11:33.160 --> 06:11:33.948 align:start position:0%
think the ought to pass motion that's on
the

06:11:33.948 --> 06:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:11:36.708 --> 06:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
table uh I don't understand what you
 
06:11:38.510 --> 06:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
what it expect what it expects to
 
06:11:39.788 --> 06:11:39.798 align:start position:0%
accomplish which I think other people
 
06:11:41.708 --> 06:11:41.718 align:start position:0%
have asked already but I would offer the
 
06:11:43.948 --> 06:11:43.958 align:start position:0%
further position that I think it should
 
06:11:46.070 --> 06:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
just be ited it doesn't really do
 
06:11:47.990 --> 06:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
anything the governor is already
 
06:11:49.390 --> 06:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
involved in these decisions and he
 
06:11:51.670 --> 06:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
already has oversight and he already has
 
06:11:51.680 --> 06:11:54.310 align:start position:0%
already has oversight and he already has
input

06:11:54.310 --> 06:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:57.708 --> 06:11:57.718 align:start position:0%
so it's kind nonstarter
 
06:11:59.990 --> 06:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative I I'm allowed to speak
 
06:12:02.190 --> 06:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
because uh I just talked I asked Paul
 
06:12:04.230 --> 06:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
and I can participate it's only in
 
06:12:06.510 --> 06:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
public hearings where I can't oh okay
 
06:12:08.788 --> 06:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
okay so clarification okay sorry to
 
06:12:10.270 --> 06:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
interrup representative mner is
 
06:12:12.830 --> 06:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
recognized yes um going back to
 
06:12:14.628 --> 06:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
testimony that day that Mike fitgerald
 
06:12:17.750 --> 06:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
um did go to the last hearing on this
 
06:12:20.468 --> 06:12:20.478 align:start position:0%
last year it was de's decision to the
 
06:12:23.590 --> 06:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
governor recommendation in an meu that
 
06:12:27.350 --> 06:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
we not participate TCI so uh the the
 
06:12:28.990 --> 06:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
dees is the one that made the decision
 
06:12:30.910 --> 06:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
for us not to participate in this right
 
06:12:32.390 --> 06:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
now that that was their recommendation
 
06:12:34.868 --> 06:12:34.878 align:start position:0%
to the governor and but the proposal to
 
06:12:36.468 --> 06:12:36.478 align:start position:0%
put a cap on carbon emissions from
 
06:12:38.788 --> 06:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
gasoline vehicles which would force gas
 
06:12:40.948 --> 06:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
Distributors to pay allowances to sell
 
06:12:43.350 --> 06:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
gas above the that cap revenues from
 
06:12:45.190 --> 06:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
those allowances will then be sent back
 
06:12:47.948 --> 06:12:47.958 align:start position:0%
to participating States in which the gas
 
06:12:47.958 --> 06:12:48.910 align:start position:0%
to participating States in which the gas
was

06:12:48.910 --> 06:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:12:51.628 --> 06:12:51.638 align:start position:0%
purchased but this bill isn't on TCI
 
06:12:54.030 --> 06:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
this is just on whether or not Dees can
 
06:12:57.070 --> 06:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
talk to people it doesn't to do with
 
06:13:00.150 --> 06:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
whether we participate in
 
06:13:03.150 --> 06:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
PCI and then his and and and to the
 
06:13:07.270 --> 06:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
amendment they can still go listen so
 
06:13:08.948 --> 06:13:08.958 align:start position:0%
that's you know we can still listen and
 
06:13:10.628 --> 06:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
they can they can stand it and you back
 
06:13:13.590 --> 06:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
to the governor say maybe they want it
 
06:13:15.150 --> 06:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
that's the whole real the purpose of the
 
06:13:17.150 --> 06:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
bill I think my my point is that it
 
06:13:19.670 --> 06:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't really do anything it doesn't
 
06:13:19.680 --> 06:13:20.708 align:start position:0%
doesn't really do anything it doesn't
affect

06:13:20.708 --> 06:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
affect
 
06:13:23.230 --> 06:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
anything that's the it doesn't have any
 
06:13:24.670 --> 06:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
effect that's why I don't think we need
 
06:13:29.270 --> 06:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:32.030 --> 06:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
tax an earlier version of this bill
 
06:13:35.510 --> 06:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
actually struck the language in the RSA
 
06:13:39.030 --> 06:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
that allowed the appropriation of funds
 
06:13:40.548 --> 06:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
this version of the bill doesn't seem to
 
06:13:44.070 --> 06:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
do that so uh representative Bernardi is
 
06:13:47.750 --> 06:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
recognized for a comment thank you uh Mr
 
06:13:49.990 --> 06:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you for letting me
 
06:13:52.548 --> 06:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
comment on this speak loudly I I believe
 
06:13:54.910 --> 06:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does
 
06:13:59.750 --> 06:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
exactly uh addresses TCI it it is it is
 
06:14:02.830 --> 06:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
part of a legislative initiative to say
 
06:14:05.190 --> 06:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
we are not going to participate we are
 
06:14:07.708 --> 06:14:07.718 align:start position:0%
essentially validating the governor's
 
06:14:10.150 --> 06:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
and the de's opinion that is
 
06:14:12.350 --> 06:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for us to participate in
 
06:14:15.788 --> 06:14:15.798 align:start position:0%
TCI now or when a governor changes that
 
06:14:18.430 --> 06:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
wants to wants to participate in some
 
06:14:22.750 --> 06:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
such craziness as uh creating a
 
06:14:27.150 --> 06:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
regressive gas tax system so this bill
 
06:14:30.990 --> 06:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
then Pro prohibits us from doing that
 
06:14:33.948 --> 06:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
unless on a caseby casee basis it's
 
06:14:37.190 --> 06:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
authorized for some
 
06:14:39.990 --> 06:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
discussion okay uh representative mck
 
06:14:43.390 --> 06:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
Williams you still have no raise hand
 
06:14:45.948 --> 06:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
capability I'm wondering maybe if Jen 4
 
06:14:48.110 --> 06:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
can look into this because I still don't
 
06:14:49.910 --> 06:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do raise hand on
 
06:14:51.548 --> 06:14:51.558 align:start position:0%
Zoom but thank you for calling on me
 
06:14:54.948 --> 06:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
chair Vose um I I want to bring up a
 
06:14:56.750 --> 06:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
rather important piece to this
 
06:14:59.350 --> 06:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
um when we look at separation of powers
 
06:15:01.350 --> 06:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
right we've got the legislative the
 
06:15:05.110 --> 06:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
judicial and the executive Dees is part
 
06:15:08.230 --> 06:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
of the executive branch so it it's
 
06:15:10.070 --> 06:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
really up to the governor as the
 
06:15:11.948 --> 06:15:11.958 align:start position:0%
executive to decide who he wants to
 
06:15:14.430 --> 06:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
staff and how he wants to manage his
 
06:15:18.030 --> 06:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
executive branch and therefore Dees when
 
06:15:21.030 --> 06:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
you bring in another branch in this case
 
06:15:24.110 --> 06:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
the legislative to write a bill that
 
06:15:27.030 --> 06:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
says the governor can micromanage his
 
06:15:29.910 --> 06:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
Dees staffers of the air quality
 
06:15:32.830 --> 06:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
division we are in effect act acting as
 
06:15:36.350 --> 06:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
an accomplice to write a really bad Bill
 
06:15:38.310 --> 06:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
you know this is a sort of legislation
 
06:15:39.948 --> 06:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
that you look back at and say why on
 
06:15:41.590 --> 06:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
Earth would we have the legislator
 
06:15:44.270 --> 06:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
saying the governor can micromanage Dees
 
06:15:46.310 --> 06:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
the governor and Dees need to go get
 
06:15:47.788 --> 06:15:47.798 align:start position:0%
together in a room and decide who's
 
06:15:49.390 --> 06:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
doing what who's in charge and if that
 
06:15:52.110 --> 06:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
means firing people do it this is just
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
silly for the legislature to get
 
06:15:58.510 --> 06:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
involved okay thank you for that comment
 
06:16:00.990 --> 06:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams uh
 
06:16:03.110 --> 06:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington is recognized
 
06:16:04.150 --> 06:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
for a
 
06:16:06.070 --> 06:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
comment yeah I just want to say I
 
06:16:09.030 --> 06:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
discussed this with uh Chris Elms the uh
 
06:16:11.150 --> 06:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
Governor's legislative uh guy this
 
06:16:13.430 --> 06:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
morning and he said they had no problem
 
06:16:15.430 --> 06:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
with the the bill uh especially as
 
06:16:18.270 --> 06:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
amended the dees has already decided on
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
their own valtion to get out of the
 
06:16:22.510 --> 06:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
transportation initiative and that they
 
06:16:24.628 --> 06:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be attending it further but I
 
06:16:26.510 --> 06:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
think the amendment gives a little more
 
06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility uh so that we uh different
 
06:16:30.750 --> 06:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
departments could get back involved in
 
06:16:32.750 --> 06:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
it and it's just you know it's a simple
 
06:16:34.910 --> 06:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
matter of not spending money on
 
06:16:38.830 --> 06:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:42.150 --> 06:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
endorse thank you representative n um I
 
06:16:44.030 --> 06:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
have thank you um Mr chairman and thank
 
06:16:45.670 --> 06:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
you for taking the
 
06:16:48.590 --> 06:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
question representative Harrington um
 
06:16:51.430 --> 06:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
did you discuss with Chris Elms the
 
06:16:54.150 --> 06:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
bill without the amendment are they okay
 
06:16:57.030 --> 06:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
with it without the amendment
 
06:16:58.628 --> 06:16:58.638 align:start position:0%
uh basically he said they could live
 
06:17:00.070 --> 06:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
with it either way but they probably
 
06:17:01.390 --> 06:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
preferred it with the
 
06:17:05.390 --> 06:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:10.270 --> 06:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
you uh next up is representative
 
06:17:13.390 --> 06:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
oxenham just a comment I I just hope
 
06:17:16.868 --> 06:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
it's a very slow news day because I just
 
06:17:18.868 --> 06:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire is going to be
 
06:17:21.190 --> 06:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
ridiculed from one end of the country to
 
06:17:24.990 --> 06:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
the other for such an absurd piece of
 
06:17:25.000 --> 06:17:26.670 align:start position:0%
the other for such an absurd piece of
legislation

06:17:26.670 --> 06:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:17:27.708 --> 06:17:27.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:17:30.150 --> 06:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative representative pel has
 
06:17:33.350 --> 06:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:35.510 --> 06:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
comment don't forget to
 
06:17:38.190 --> 06:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
unmute thank you Mr chairman there's
 
06:17:41.390 --> 06:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
been some good points and I and you know
 
06:17:44.948 --> 06:17:44.958 align:start position:0%
the whole idea that that uh we're uh
 
06:17:47.230 --> 06:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
we're gaining flexibility by this bill
 
06:17:50.350 --> 06:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
this is this bill removes flexibility it
 
06:17:55.310 --> 06:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
is it is once again it's a gag order it
 
06:17:59.948 --> 06:17:59.958 align:start position:0%
uh it hobbles the uh what our Dees can
 
06:18:04.868 --> 06:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
do and in a way it hobbles the governor
 
06:18:07.910 --> 06:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to because he has to act on
 
06:18:12.110 --> 06:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
every specific request not you know why
 
06:18:14.910 --> 06:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
not just give him the authority to give
 
06:18:17.750 --> 06:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
a blanket okay or
 
06:18:20.590 --> 06:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
not that's the governor's
 
06:18:24.070 --> 06:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
prerogative this is not a good
 
06:18:26.788 --> 06:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
bill we are not going to be happy with
 
06:18:28.948 --> 06:18:28.958 align:start position:0%
it you're not going to be happy with it
 
06:18:32.788 --> 06:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
when you find out what happens thank
 
06:18:36.070 --> 06:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you I'm hearing the same
 
06:18:39.030 --> 06:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
comments over and over and over so U I
 
06:18:41.030 --> 06:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
think I'm GNA in discussion on this
 
06:18:43.948 --> 06:18:43.958 align:start position:0%
amendment now and ask the clerk to call
 
06:18:47.350 --> 06:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
the role on the amend Mr chairman I I
 
06:18:48.910 --> 06:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
don't think you can do that I think
 
06:18:51.030 --> 06:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
people have something to say you have no
 
06:18:52.750 --> 06:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
idea whether they're going to repeat
 
06:18:54.868 --> 06:18:54.878 align:start position:0%
themselves I know I'm not going to so
 
06:19:05.070 --> 06:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:08.270 --> 06:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
I was distracted um representative stit
 
06:19:10.868 --> 06:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
you were saying that you're certain that
 
06:19:13.868 --> 06:19:13.878 align:start position:0%
someone has a new comment to make well
 
06:19:16.070 --> 06:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I can understand you
 
06:19:18.910 --> 06:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
asking people only to make new comments
 
06:19:21.270 --> 06:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
and that is understandable but to assume
 
06:19:22.990 --> 06:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
that everyone's going to just repeat
 
06:19:26.190 --> 06:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
what has been said is a wild assum asson
 
06:19:29.430 --> 06:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
on your part I think so I know from my
 
06:19:31.310 --> 06:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
point of view I'm I'm not going to say
 
06:19:33.310 --> 06:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
the same things so I'd like to say
 
06:19:34.708 --> 06:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
something different so that's why I
 
06:19:37.468 --> 06:19:37.478 align:start position:0%
raised my hand okay well I thank you for
 
06:19:39.948 --> 06:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
that comment I would caution you that I
 
06:19:42.350 --> 06:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
did not say that I assume everyone's
 
06:19:44.270 --> 06:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
going to say the same thing what I said
 
06:19:47.948 --> 06:19:47.958 align:start position:0%
was I'm hearing the same things over and
 
06:19:51.990 --> 06:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
over and that gave me pause to wonder if
 
06:19:54.270 --> 06:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
we need to continue this discussion if I
 
06:19:56.150 --> 06:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
keep hearing the same ISS issues
 
06:19:58.230 --> 06:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
discussed over and over the same points
 
06:20:01.670 --> 06:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
being brought up I don't see any
 
06:20:04.350 --> 06:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason to go on now if
 
06:20:08.070 --> 06:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
somebody does have a new point to make
 
06:20:10.510 --> 06:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to listen
 
06:20:13.910 --> 06:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
so if you do have a new point to make I
 
06:20:16.990 --> 06:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
will call on you if you do not please
 
06:20:20.350 --> 06:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:22.788 --> 06:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
down all right I recognize
 
06:20:24.830 --> 06:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative partial for a brand new
 
06:20:24.840 --> 06:20:26.430 align:start position:0%
representative partial for a brand new
point

06:20:26.430 --> 06:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
point
 
06:20:28.788 --> 06:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman folks this not so
 
06:20:31.708 --> 06:20:31.718 align:start position:0%
much of uh comment is a uh maybe a
 
06:20:33.868 --> 06:20:33.878 align:start position:0%
speculative question but I am looking
 
06:20:36.190 --> 06:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
the language uh representative Thomas
 
06:20:38.310 --> 06:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
maybe you can clarify this says unless
 
06:20:41.310 --> 06:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
specifically directed by the governor or
 
06:20:44.030 --> 06:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
designated representative on a case-by
 
06:20:46.350 --> 06:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
Case basis now I think you've made the
 
06:20:48.788 --> 06:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
case that the department of energy can
 
06:20:51.590 --> 06:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
come is a designate their representative
 
06:20:54.150 --> 06:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
to come and listen in but I'm wondering
 
06:20:55.510 --> 06:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
what's going to prevent the department
 
06:20:57.948 --> 06:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
of of uh environmental services from
 
06:21:01.430 --> 06:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing and perhaps I'm new
 
06:21:02.830 --> 06:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
and ignorant here but I'm just wondering
 
06:21:04.910 --> 06:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
if you could enlighten me on this
 
06:21:08.190 --> 06:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
area thank you so that's a question for
 
06:21:11.190 --> 06:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas uh I think that
 
06:21:13.150 --> 06:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
you're I I assume representative tras
 
06:21:15.230 --> 06:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
you feel qualified best qualified answer
 
06:21:18.948 --> 06:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
it as you drafted the uh Amendment so
 
06:21:21.590 --> 06:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes I'll allow that representative
 
06:21:24.628 --> 06:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
Thomas if I understand the question
 
06:21:24.638 --> 06:21:27.510 align:start position:0%
Thomas if I understand the question
correctly

06:21:27.510 --> 06:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
06:21:27.520 --> 06:21:29.390 align:start position:0%
correctly
this

06:21:29.390 --> 06:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:21:32.628 --> 06:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm not sure I can sit any way
 
06:21:35.110 --> 06:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
differently this amendment would
 
06:21:38.708 --> 06:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
allow the department head perhaps to say
 
06:21:42.548 --> 06:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
U we believe that uh we have good cause
 
06:21:45.510 --> 06:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
to go and listen to a meeting on a
 
06:21:47.310 --> 06:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
program that you said that we would not
 
06:21:50.150 --> 06:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
be participating in in a program that we
 
06:21:51.430 --> 06:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
said we didn't think we should be
 
06:21:53.788 --> 06:21:53.798 align:start position:0%
participating in but we think that it
 
06:21:56.990 --> 06:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
would be a good idea to to listen
 
06:21:59.750 --> 06:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh may we attend and spend State money
 
06:22:01.910 --> 06:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
to do so and this would allow the
 
06:22:04.750 --> 06:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
governor to say to listen to their point
 
06:22:07.030 --> 06:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
and say either no I don't think we'll
 
06:22:08.830 --> 06:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
spend money through that meeting or he
 
06:22:12.628 --> 06:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
could say or the designated could say
 
06:22:14.310 --> 06:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
yes we think this is a good one to go
 
06:22:16.110 --> 06:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
and listen to I don't think I can make
 
06:22:18.910 --> 06:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
it any plainer as to what the intent of
 
06:22:20.310 --> 06:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:22:22.788 --> 06:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
does I I really don't have any more
 
06:22:25.910 --> 06:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
answers to answer same question question
 
06:22:28.390 --> 06:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
stated in different terms so apologize
 
06:22:30.868 --> 06:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
for that that's that's what that's a
 
06:22:32.990 --> 06:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
very simple Amendment that's what it
 
06:22:36.590 --> 06:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
gives that gratitude nothing else no
 
06:22:38.708 --> 06:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
apology necessary and I'm not weighing
 
06:22:40.670 --> 06:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
on the bill itself I feel like I'm
 
06:22:42.910 --> 06:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
really not qualified to understand its
 
06:22:44.990 --> 06:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
full history but I'm this looking at the
 
06:22:47.350 --> 06:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
language here and I'm this wondering if
 
06:22:48.708 --> 06:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
it could be re worded to make it a
 
06:22:51.468 --> 06:22:51.478 align:start position:0%
little stronger about who the designated
 
06:22:54.030 --> 06:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives would be that's all and
 
06:22:55.990 --> 06:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for the time you sp
 
06:22:56.000 --> 06:22:56.750 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for the time you sp
on

06:22:56.750 --> 06:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:22:59.948 --> 06:22:59.958 align:start position:0%
it thank you uh representative mner is
 
06:23:03.670 --> 06:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
Rec recognized for a question oh I was a
 
06:23:06.910 --> 06:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
fake hand wave it was okay uh
 
06:23:09.670 --> 06:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative crean is recognized for a
 
06:23:12.430 --> 06:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
new point that we haven't heard before
 
06:23:15.788 --> 06:23:15.798 align:start position:0%
yeah um just a question really following
 
06:23:17.670 --> 06:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
up on that last
 
06:23:20.190 --> 06:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
one representative paral brought up the
 
06:23:22.990 --> 06:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
point what is preventing Dees from
 
06:23:26.070 --> 06:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
interpreting themselves as a design of
 
06:23:26.080 --> 06:23:27.590 align:start position:0%
interpreting themselves as a design of
the

06:23:27.590 --> 06:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:23:29.868 --> 06:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
governor is that what you were asking
 
06:23:33.350 --> 06:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative partiel I don't
 
06:23:35.628 --> 06:23:35.638 align:start position:0%
okay because I'm also confused on this
 
06:23:37.628 --> 06:23:37.638 align:start position:0%
point would you like representative
 
06:23:39.150 --> 06:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
Thomas to
 
06:23:41.510 --> 06:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
respond please if he
 
06:23:43.948 --> 06:23:43.958 align:start position:0%
could representative
 
06:23:48.670 --> 06:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
Thomas could you restate that
 
06:23:54.030 --> 06:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
restated sure sorry um so what prevents
 
06:23:57.110 --> 06:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
Dees from deciding that they are
 
06:23:59.310 --> 06:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
designes of the governor and making
 
06:24:02.670 --> 06:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
their own decisions and thus
 
06:24:05.708 --> 06:24:05.718 align:start position:0%
making this entire Amendment
 
06:24:10.830 --> 06:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
move well my opinion and time spent in
 
06:24:10.840 --> 06:24:11.830 align:start position:0%
move well my opinion and time spent in
government

06:24:11.830 --> 06:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:24:14.990 --> 06:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
service both in the military and in
 
06:24:20.468 --> 06:24:20.478 align:start position:0%
actual d d SL service you one normally
 
06:24:24.990 --> 06:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
does not assume that they are the design
 
06:24:28.030 --> 06:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
for or their higher level boss unless
 
06:24:30.510 --> 06:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
they get either something in writing or
 
06:24:32.628 --> 06:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's understood in their Charter that
 
06:24:34.948 --> 06:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
they are the design need for that
 
06:24:37.830 --> 06:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
particular item so I don't believe there
 
06:24:39.750 --> 06:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
could be any misinterpretation unless
 
06:24:41.110 --> 06:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted
 
06:24:43.468 --> 06:24:43.478 align:start position:0%
to um
 
06:24:47.150 --> 06:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
either on purpose or mistakenly
 
06:24:50.468 --> 06:24:50.478 align:start position:0%
supersede that particular director so I
 
06:24:52.548 --> 06:24:52.558 align:start position:0%
I believe that that unless they were
 
06:24:52.558 --> 06:24:54.270 align:start position:0%
I believe that that unless they were
given

06:24:54.270 --> 06:24:54.280 align:start position:0%
given
 
06:24:57.750 --> 06:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
specific direction that they word does
 
06:24:59.190 --> 06:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
that they would not be assuming that
 
06:25:02.350 --> 06:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
point in this particular
 
06:25:05.070 --> 06:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
here thank you representative man do you
 
06:25:07.830 --> 06:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
have a new point to make I think it's
 
06:25:10.468 --> 06:25:10.478 align:start position:0%
new but maybe it isn't I think if the
 
06:25:13.150 --> 06:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
governor wants to exclude Dees from
 
06:25:15.548 --> 06:25:15.558 align:start position:0%
understanding or or giving opinions
 
06:25:19.670 --> 06:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
about um air pollution and so on that he
 
06:25:22.990 --> 06:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
should do it on his own and um take
 
06:25:24.948 --> 06:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
responsibility for it I don't think we
 
06:25:25.788 --> 06:25:25.798 align:start position:0%
as a
 
06:25:28.030 --> 06:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
legislature should be providing him
 
06:25:31.030 --> 06:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
cover by forcing the issue with a with a
 
06:25:33.628 --> 06:25:33.638 align:start position:0%
bit of legislation I don't see any
 
06:25:35.628 --> 06:25:35.638 align:start position:0%
reason for this legislation that makes
 
06:25:39.070 --> 06:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
any sense thank you okay thank you
 
06:25:40.868 --> 06:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
representative samit you have a new
 
06:25:40.878 --> 06:25:43.590 align:start position:0%
representative samit you have a new
point

06:25:43.590 --> 06:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:47.708 --> 06:25:47.718 align:start position:0%
tonight uh yes I do Mr chairman so a
 
06:25:50.310 --> 06:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
couple of new points in fact so number
 
06:25:53.270 --> 06:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
one this bill is not about any kind of
 
06:25:56.230 --> 06:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation initiative
 
06:25:58.750 --> 06:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
it could be in the future but it's not
 
06:26:00.270 --> 06:26:00.280 align:start position:0%
about that that's not what we're
 
06:26:01.750 --> 06:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
discussing here we're discussing
 
06:26:05.110 --> 06:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
something very different number two I
 
06:26:08.628 --> 06:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
think this bill Fosters a a strong
 
06:26:10.868 --> 06:26:10.878 align:start position:0%
partisanship that we should not be
 
06:26:13.468 --> 06:26:13.478 align:start position:0%
encouraging if the if the next Governor
 
06:26:16.110 --> 06:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
is a Democratic governor and then he's
 
06:26:18.830 --> 06:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to designate what the dees does
 
06:26:21.430 --> 06:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
and doesn't do I don't think some people
 
06:26:23.190 --> 06:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
on this committee would be too happy
 
06:26:27.590 --> 06:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
about that and and because that Dees is
 
06:26:30.150 --> 06:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
not just a resource for the governor he
 
06:26:32.590 --> 06:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
they're also a resource for us when we
 
06:26:35.590 --> 06:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
go to them with a question and ask how
 
06:26:38.430 --> 06:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
can you help us with a certain issue we
 
06:26:41.270 --> 06:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
get pretty good and pretty an unbiased
 
06:26:44.030 --> 06:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
information which is very valuable to us
 
06:26:47.628 --> 06:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
as legislators and finally uh I would
 
06:26:50.110 --> 06:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
not be surprised if we go down this path
 
06:26:51.628 --> 06:26:51.638 align:start position:0%
that the next thing will happen is we're
 
06:26:53.230 --> 06:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
going to tell Dees that they're not
 
06:26:55.750 --> 06:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate in anything
 
06:27:03.708 --> 06:27:03.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:06.390 --> 06:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
much thank you representative
 
06:27:08.628 --> 06:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has recognized for
 
06:27:08.638 --> 06:27:10.310 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has recognized for
the

06:27:10.310 --> 06:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:27:14.708 --> 06:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
comment Mr chair I
 
06:27:19.230 --> 06:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
just point of order com did he look at
 
06:27:22.708 --> 06:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
the but I uh I I I have not heard
 
06:27:25.310 --> 06:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
anything different the last 10 minutes
 
06:27:28.350 --> 06:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
really I would like suggest that we call
 
06:27:30.948 --> 06:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
the vote I don't think
 
06:27:33.750 --> 06:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
so I have something to say
 
06:27:36.468 --> 06:27:36.478 align:start position:0%
representative C pittz you're the last
 
06:27:38.548 --> 06:27:38.558 align:start position:0%
speaker on this and and I wish
 
06:27:40.150 --> 06:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas would speak into
 
06:27:44.830 --> 06:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
the microphone I um I never got the
 
06:27:46.750 --> 06:27:46.760 align:start position:0%

it out but I didn't get it so I want to
 
06:28:08.190 --> 06:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
ask representative Thomas if he in that
 
06:28:13.510 --> 06:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:16.190 --> 06:28:16.200 align:start position:0%

06:28:46.150 --> 06:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
06:28:49.430 --> 06:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
shall not participate in discussions or
 
06:28:52.070 --> 06:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
planning of such programs unless
 
06:28:54.510 --> 06:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
specifically directed by the governor or
 
06:28:59.150 --> 06:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:03.310 --> 06:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
basis thank you and my my I I don't get
 
06:29:05.190 --> 06:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
passionate about much I don't have much
 
06:29:08.510 --> 06:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
passion left in me but anybody who says
 
06:29:10.990 --> 06:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
do not
 
06:29:13.868 --> 06:29:13.878 align:start position:0%
discuss that means internally or with
 
06:29:17.430 --> 06:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
somebody else that to me is a slippery
 
06:29:20.190 --> 06:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
slope and something this legislature
 
06:29:21.590 --> 06:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
should not get
 
06:29:24.350 --> 06:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
into there is a freedom of speech
 
06:29:26.910 --> 06:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
whether you bought likes it or not I can
 
06:29:29.510 --> 06:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
turn around and discuss whatever I
 
06:29:32.230 --> 06:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
want as long as it doesn't impinge with
 
06:29:34.910 --> 06:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
the business as long as I'm not charging
 
06:29:37.548 --> 06:29:37.558 align:start position:0%
him or on the clock so that means in the
 
06:29:39.750 --> 06:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
cafeteria or at lunch or whatever they
 
06:29:43.110 --> 06:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
can't discuss any program how do we know
 
06:29:45.868 --> 06:29:45.878 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas whether something
 
06:29:49.990 --> 06:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
is going on if we don't discuss it now
 
06:29:52.190 --> 06:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
you want to put a cap on money spent you
 
06:29:53.510 --> 06:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
want to say if you're going to spend
 
06:29:56.230 --> 06:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
over you know $0000 you have to get
 
06:29:58.548 --> 06:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
permission to do it I would be okay with
 
06:30:01.990 --> 06:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
that if it's valid you could get it but
 
06:30:04.270 --> 06:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
right now most things are this way it
 
06:30:08.350 --> 06:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost me a quarter to sit here so
 
06:30:10.548 --> 06:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
06:30:14.548 --> 06:30:14.558 align:start position:0%
wondering why anybody would come up with
 
06:30:17.548 --> 06:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
the idea to muzzle
 
06:30:20.948 --> 06:30:20.958 align:start position:0%
speech and and I I did say dag order
 
06:30:23.190 --> 06:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
because I think that is a very slippery
 
06:30:25.708 --> 06:30:25.718 align:start position:0%
thing what if I decide that Finance
 
06:30:28.750 --> 06:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
can't discuss school vouchers what if I
 
06:30:32.430 --> 06:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
decide you know this is opening a can of
 
06:30:35.430 --> 06:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
worms and I think that can should be
 
06:30:37.990 --> 06:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
shut thank
 
06:30:40.468 --> 06:30:40.478 align:start position:0%

06:30:42.388 --> 06:30:42.398 align:start position:0%

this uh put this in the garbage where it
 
06:31:01.230 --> 06:31:01.240 align:start position:0%

itl um this is not a good bill uh it
 
06:35:02.430 --> 06:35:02.440 align:start position:0%

06:35:04.070 --> 06:35:04.080 align:start position:0%

oxam thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:35:35.590 --> 06:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
taking my comment um I I really do think
 
06:35:37.868 --> 06:35:37.878 align:start position:0%
that we should not be proceeding with
 
06:35:40.430 --> 06:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
this the the fact that it singles out
 
06:35:42.468 --> 06:35:42.478 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
06:35:45.510 --> 06:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
in this way does a real disservice to
 
06:35:48.388 --> 06:35:48.398 align:start position:0%
some fine public servants who have done
 
06:35:50.430 --> 06:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
extraordinary work on behalf of the
 
06:35:52.788 --> 06:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
residents and citizens of New Hampshire
 
06:36:00.788 --> 06:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:05.430 --> 06:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:08.350 --> 06:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
pittz I've been brought to tears
 
06:36:12.388 --> 06:36:12.398 align:start position:0%
twice January over government January 6
 
06:36:16.388 --> 06:36:16.398 align:start position:0%
and today and just the statement from
 
06:36:19.590 --> 06:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
Francis Bon I may not agree with what
 
06:36:22.548 --> 06:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
you have to say but I will fight to the
 
06:36:25.190 --> 06:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
death for your right to say it
 
06:36:28.670 --> 06:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
and nobody should interfere with that
 
06:36:32.910 --> 06:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
right of the people voice I do not
 
06:36:35.830 --> 06:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
believe that if our Dees is doing a
 
06:36:39.670 --> 06:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
crummy job get rid of them but we have a
 
06:36:41.388 --> 06:36:41.398 align:start position:0%
right to know what's going on New
 
06:36:46.150 --> 06:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:48.590 --> 06:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
bubble okay I would just say that I
 
06:36:50.868 --> 06:36:50.878 align:start position:0%
would just remind everybody that this
 
06:36:53.708 --> 06:36:53.718 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't muzzle the department of
 
06:36:56.910 --> 06:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
environment services from talking about
 
06:36:59.708 --> 06:36:59.718 align:start position:0%
things in general it's it applies
 
06:37:01.670 --> 06:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
specifically to low carbon fuel
 
06:37:04.388 --> 06:37:04.398 align:start position:0%
standards programs there can't be many
 
06:37:07.388 --> 06:37:07.398 align:start position:0%
of those and it doesn't really muzzle
 
06:37:09.708 --> 06:37:09.718 align:start position:0%
them even regard to
 
06:37:13.110 --> 06:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
that so I think maybe some of these
 
06:37:15.788 --> 06:37:15.798 align:start position:0%
arguments that I've heard are a little
 
06:37:18.868 --> 06:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
overflowing uh seeing no more hands up
 
06:37:20.670 --> 06:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
for further discussion I'm going to call
 
06:37:23.548 --> 06:37:23.558 align:start position:0%
the question and ask the clerk ask the
 
06:37:24.708 --> 06:37:24.718 align:start position:0%

that's where people get their mail but
 
06:42:01.788 --> 06:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
it was sent to all science and energy
 
06:42:06.270 --> 06:42:06.280 align:start position:0%

us a little overview what does it do uh

all thermal projects uh that were up to
 
06:42:21.270 --> 06:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
any anything that has received any

wrecks up until uh the beginning of next

year so existing uh projects that were

06:45:51.150 --> 06:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
information for folks on the committee
 
06:45:54.750 --> 06:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
for both sides of both caucuses is so uh
 
06:45:56.430 --> 06:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
would it be okay if I just sent that out
 
06:45:58.868 --> 06:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
to people I'm not going to send people's
 
06:46:00.590 --> 06:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
personal contact information if they
 
06:46:02.670 --> 06:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
don't want it like phone numbers and
 
06:46:03.750 --> 06:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
whatever if they don't want their
 
06:46:06.190 --> 06:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
personal phone numbers but you can just
 
06:46:09.150 --> 06:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
email me and by five o'clock today I'll
 
06:46:11.670 --> 06:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
send uh the sheet that I have so that
 
06:46:13.230 --> 06:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
people can get in touch with each other
 
06:46:15.430 --> 06:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
if they want to Mr chairman can I say
 
06:46:17.910 --> 06:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
something yes thank you for making that
 
06:46:22.388 --> 06:46:22.398 align:start position:0%
offer representative n thank you um
 
06:46:24.868 --> 06:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
representative your name is Skate mgee
 
06:46:27.230 --> 06:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh could you take my Comcast email
 
06:46:30.310 --> 06:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
address off that list I I like to get
 
06:46:32.788 --> 06:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
keep it separate and I've been getting
 
06:46:36.230 --> 06:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
emails in both boxes and I'd rather just
 
06:46:38.750 --> 06:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
have them all in one place absolutely
 
06:46:40.310 --> 06:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking because I think it
 
06:46:42.468 --> 06:46:42.478 align:start position:0%
makes sense that we have a contact list

06:50:17.750 --> 06:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
calendar by a vote of 21 to zero motion
 
06:50:21.388 --> 06:50:21.398 align:start position:0%
of itl on h225 is
 
06:50:25.310 --> 06:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
adopted and representative flet will
 
06:50:29.670 --> 06:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
write a brief what majority
 
06:50:32.590 --> 06:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
report is it concept yeah but it still
 
06:50:35.070 --> 06:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
has to have to report okay it could be
 
06:50:38.750 --> 06:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
two lines I mean okay nothing doesn't
 
06:50:41.230 --> 06:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
have to be anything sign but we don't
 
06:50:41.240 --> 06:50:42.070 align:start position:0%
have to be anything sign but we don't
like

06:50:42.070 --> 06:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:50:42.080 --> 06:50:44.110 align:start position:0%
like
it

06:50:44.110 --> 06:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:50:47.388 --> 06:50:47.398 align:start position:0%
so it is now seven minutes before four
 
06:50:50.030 --> 06:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
o'clock and we have the room for another
 
06:50:54.030 --> 06:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
hour and seven minutes and being
 
06:50:56.628 --> 06:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
opportunistic I think we should continue
 
06:51:00.670 --> 06:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
to uh conduct exact sessions on a few
 
06:51:04.910 --> 06:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
more bills I know that um could we have
 
06:51:06.708 --> 06:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
a break
 
06:51:09.270 --> 06:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
first we could take a break minut would
 
06:51:11.910 --> 06:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
you take aak biak but at four o'clock I
 
06:51:13.510 --> 06:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
would ask everybody to come back and we
 
06:51:20.388 --> 06:51:20.398 align:start position:0%
will exec HB 308 HB 309 and HB 168 time
 
06:51:23.628 --> 06:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
fored so thank you and take a break
 
06:51:24.750 --> 06:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
until four
 
06:51:29.230 --> 06:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
o'clock thank you Mr chair could we also
 
06:51:31.150 --> 06:51:31.160 align:start position:0%
could we also ask Jen to get us the
 
06:51:34.030 --> 06:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
sheets for the other three hearings
 
06:51:38.948 --> 06:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
today 225 148 and 167 I don't think we
 
06:51:40.868 --> 06:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
we had call outs on the numbers for four
 
06:51:43.350 --> 06:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
and against if we could just get them
 
06:51:44.628 --> 06:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
that' be
 
06:51:47.070 --> 06:51:47.080 align:start position:0%
great you're asking about today's bills
 
06:51:49.708 --> 06:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
is that correct correct or the exec
 
06:51:53.110 --> 06:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
bills no not the exec bills we okay most
 
06:51:53.120 --> 06:51:54.990 align:start position:0%
bills no not the exec bills we okay most
of

06:51:54.990 --> 06:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:51:57.548 --> 06:51:57.558 align:start position:0%
those yeah
 
06:52:01.070 --> 06:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
iug I'm just trying to keep up
 
06:52:01.080 --> 06:52:05.948 align:start position:0%
iug I'm just trying to keep up
as

06:52:05.948 --> 06:52:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:21.830 --> 06:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:21.840 --> 06:53:18.430 align:start position:0%
 
died

06:53:18.430 --> 06:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:20.468 --> 06:53:20.478 align:start position:0%
so I did send out that information on
 
06:53:22.510 --> 06:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
Advanced reactors and the funding to
 
06:53:24.510 --> 06:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
every everybody's mailbox so you should
 
06:53:25.990 --> 06:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
have it as
 
06:53:26.000 --> 06:53:29.788 align:start position:0%
have it as
well

06:53:29.788 --> 06:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:32.910 --> 06:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
great thank you and Jackie to follow up
 
06:53:35.310 --> 06:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
on your concern it was a normal reactor
 
06:53:37.708 --> 06:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
trip down in Texas what happened is the
 
06:53:41.388 --> 06:53:41.398 align:start position:0%
sensing line to the feedwater pump froze
 
06:53:43.030 --> 06:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
so the feedwater pump didn't know it was
 
06:53:45.590 --> 06:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
going on so it shuts itself down which
 
06:53:47.590 --> 06:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
means less water is going into the steam
 
06:53:49.750 --> 06:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
generator so the reactor says uh-uh
 
06:53:51.948 --> 06:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
can't deal with that and they shuts down
 
06:53:53.830 --> 06:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
the reactor so so it was due to the
 
06:53:56.430 --> 06:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
freeze and U you know it's just a
 
06:53:58.230 --> 06:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
different world down there how they do
 
06:54:00.190 --> 06:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
things up here that wor of while that
 
06:54:02.030 --> 06:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
pipe would have probably been indoors
 
06:54:04.468 --> 06:54:04.478 align:start position:0%
and it would have had U electric
 
06:54:06.708 --> 06:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
resistance heating taped all around it
 
06:54:08.510 --> 06:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
so it couldn't freeze no matter how cold
 
06:54:11.670 --> 06:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
it got so but in defense down there it
 
06:54:14.030 --> 06:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
was 10 below zero in parts of Texas
 
06:54:16.150 --> 06:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
which would be like it would be like in
 
06:54:19.628 --> 06:54:19.638 align:start position:0%
Portsmith going to 35
 
06:54:22.948 --> 06:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
below so and you most places probably in
 
06:54:24.388 --> 06:54:24.398 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth you'd probably have freezing
 
06:54:27.070 --> 06:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
pipes and freezing things there um when
 
06:54:28.708 --> 06:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
the temperature got that low it just it
 
06:54:31.030 --> 06:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
was just so abnormal that it was
 
06:54:35.430 --> 06:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:37.990 --> 06:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
everybody I feel sorry for those people
 
06:54:39.990 --> 06:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
but we went through what did we go three
 
06:54:41.868 --> 06:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
weeks without power in some places when
 
06:54:51.590 --> 06:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:51.600 --> 06:55:30.910 align:start position:0%
 
storm

06:55:30.910 --> 06:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:32.150 --> 06:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you caught me there I
 
06:55:35.190 --> 06:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
was saying with the the ice storm we we
 
06:55:37.388 --> 06:55:37.398 align:start position:0%
had that Jackie was speaking of people
 
06:55:39.750 --> 06:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
lost of 11 days we lost it for seven
 
06:55:43.628 --> 06:55:43.638 align:start position:0%
here some people lost it for more and um
 
06:55:45.150 --> 06:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
I think the uh power companies have
 
06:55:46.948 --> 06:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
responded quite a bit with a lot of kick
 
06:55:48.750 --> 06:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
in the butts let admit but they've
 
06:55:50.468 --> 06:55:50.478 align:start position:0%
really gotten much better at responding
 
06:55:53.070 --> 06:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
to these outages so I would have thought
 
06:55:54.948 --> 06:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
uh if it was 10 years ago the outage we
 
06:55:56.868 --> 06:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
had last weekend which was it lasted two
 
06:55:58.788 --> 06:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
hours probably would have been two days
 
06:56:01.150 --> 06:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
so yeah the problem at that time was
 
06:56:03.190 --> 06:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
they didn't have enough stay
 
06:56:05.430 --> 06:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
aparts well there was all sorts of
 
06:56:07.030 --> 06:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
problems when I was that was one of the
 
06:56:10.230 --> 06:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
big ones no inventory when I was at the
 
06:56:13.388 --> 06:56:13.398 align:start position:0%
commission they were sending people out
 
06:56:16.468 --> 06:56:16.478 align:start position:0%
in vehicles to write down written
 
06:56:19.590 --> 06:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
reports at uh outages and then they
 
06:56:21.190 --> 06:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
would drive around and collect these and
 
06:56:22.628 --> 06:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
then eventually four or five hours hour
 
06:56:25.070 --> 06:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
later they'd go back to the uh office
 
06:56:26.788 --> 06:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
and hand them over to the engineers to
 
06:56:29.310 --> 06:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
start working on Solutions and I was
 
06:56:31.110 --> 06:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
shocked because I said me you don't know
 
06:56:33.030 --> 06:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
what an Apple phone is take a picture
 
06:56:34.110 --> 06:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
and send it
 
06:56:36.270 --> 06:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
instantaneously so it's come they've
 
06:56:38.868 --> 06:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
come a long ways from where they were
 
06:56:40.910 --> 06:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
years ago a long ways we all learned
 
06:56:51.388 --> 06:56:51.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:51.398 --> 06:57:06.350 align:start position:0%
 
yep

06:57:06.350 --> 06:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:08.150 --> 06:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
and the snow is supposed to go away here
 
06:57:09.468 --> 06:57:09.478 align:start position:0%
but it's snowing harder now this is
 
06:57:11.110 --> 06:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
probably the hottest it's snowed all day
 
06:57:13.070 --> 06:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's snowing hard here too but
 
06:57:16.830 --> 06:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:19.388 --> 06:57:19.398 align:start position:0%
driveway clear I don't know probably a
 
06:57:20.948 --> 06:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
little warmer down there than we're here
 
06:57:23.230 --> 06:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
about 25 here so
 
06:57:25.910 --> 06:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's pre-treated here I think you know
 
06:57:28.788 --> 06:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
because they put so much salt on it and
 
06:57:30.628 --> 06:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
sand from before but this is supposed to
 
06:57:34.750 --> 06:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
go on all night right well they said two
 
06:57:36.830 --> 06:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
to four inches in most of the state back
 
06:57:39.628 --> 06:57:39.638 align:start position:0%
in your yard you're lucky uh Jackie
 
06:57:41.270 --> 06:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to get up to six because
 
06:57:42.590 --> 06:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
right by the coast is supposed to get
 
06:57:45.948 --> 06:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
the most uh snow but don't tell me
 
06:57:48.788 --> 06:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
because I have to shovel the car out
 
06:57:51.190 --> 06:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
of bet you just and yell at the snow it
 
06:57:53.948 --> 06:57:53.958 align:start position:0%
would go away
 
06:57:56.150 --> 06:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
well yes I do breathe
 
06:58:00.310 --> 06:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:03.430 --> 06:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
assumed no we out my front door right
 
06:58:07.150 --> 06:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:10.350 --> 06:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
day a lot of snow yeah that's it that's
 
06:58:10.360 --> 06:58:12.310 align:start position:0%
day a lot of snow yeah that's it that's
the

06:58:12.310 --> 06:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:58:15.070 --> 06:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
picture a lot of snow yeah it's been
 
06:58:16.510 --> 06:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
snowing all day here but we probably
 
06:58:19.910 --> 06:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
only gotten two or three inches so yeah
 
06:58:23.070 --> 06:58:23.080 align:start position:0%
we Chie Brown snow it's his big fluffy
 
06:58:25.788 --> 06:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
things floating down you know it feels
 
06:58:27.388 --> 06:58:27.398 align:start position:0%
like I should go for a
 
06:58:27.398 --> 06:58:30.910 align:start position:0%
like I should go for a
walk

06:58:30.910 --> 06:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:33.110 --> 06:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
outside better to listen to the rest of
 
06:58:37.190 --> 06:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:45.830 --> 06:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:49.708 --> 06:58:49.718 align:start position:0%
funny a little distance couldn't hide no
 
06:58:49.718 --> 06:58:51.230 align:start position:0%
funny a little distance couldn't hide no
it

06:58:51.230 --> 06:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:58:51.240 --> 06:58:54.030 align:start position:0%
it
couldn't

06:58:54.030 --> 06:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
06:58:58.830 --> 06:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:02.788 --> 06:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
so well we need to look at 308 and 309
 
06:59:07.070 --> 06:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the other one okay uh we will
 
06:59:14.590 --> 06:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
exec HB 308 HB 309 HB 68 time
 
06:59:17.948 --> 06:59:17.958 align:start position:0%
permitting so I'm going to open the
 
06:59:20.510 --> 06:59:20.520 align:start position:0%

308 and I'm going to recognize
 
06:59:26.830 --> 06:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
representative murder for a motion oh I

HB
 
06:59:40.468 --> 06:59:40.478 align:start position:0%
308 and uh I'll recognize representative
 
06:59:44.070 --> 06:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
bery second it's been moved and seconded
 
06:59:47.430 --> 06:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
that we retain HB
 
06:59:51.150 --> 06:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:53.868 --> 06:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
discussion for Jackie C pittz this is
 
06:59:59.388 --> 06:59:59.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:03.990 --> 07:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
attachments thank you that's really for
 
07:00:06.388 --> 07:00:06.398 align:start position:0%
everybody really
 
07:00:08.910 --> 07:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
is it is for everyone representative
 
07:00:15.948 --> 07:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:18.030 --> 07:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
comment don't forget to unmute
 
07:00:18.040 --> 07:00:20.750 align:start position:0%
comment don't forget to unmute
representative

07:00:20.750 --> 07:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:22.910 --> 07:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
Harrington there you go go sorry about
 
07:00:25.548 --> 07:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
that that's very rarely that people tell
 
07:00:27.190 --> 07:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
me to unmute usually it's the other way
 
07:00:27.200 --> 07:00:29.230 align:start position:0%
me to unmute usually it's the other way
around

07:00:29.230 --> 07:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
around
 
07:00:31.670 --> 07:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
but they uh this is a really important
 
07:00:33.830 --> 07:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
issue it's not only the the issue that
 
07:00:35.990 --> 07:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
presents itself in this case but it goes
 
07:00:38.388 --> 07:00:38.398 align:start position:0%
beyond that I think anybody who lives in
 
07:00:40.830 --> 07:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
a rural area represents rural districts
 
07:00:44.230 --> 07:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
knows that Broadband
 
07:00:47.230 --> 07:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh is is the is the issue I mean that's
 
07:00:48.670 --> 07:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
what everyone's worried about and there
 
07:00:50.628 --> 07:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
there are like I there are federal
 
07:00:52.868 --> 07:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
fundings out there I've talking to to uh
 
07:00:54.750 --> 07:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
people at the governor's office there's
 
07:00:56.468 --> 07:00:56.478 align:start position:0%
there's millions of dollars of federal
 
07:00:58.388 --> 07:00:58.398 align:start position:0%
funds but they haven't quite figured out
 
07:00:59.990 --> 07:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
what the rules and regulations are going
 
07:01:02.070 --> 07:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
to how to spend it we want to use this
 
07:01:05.310 --> 07:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
stuff wisely I mean it's it's become
 
07:01:07.388 --> 07:01:07.398 align:start position:0%
essential for people in rural areas now
 
07:01:09.590 --> 07:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
to have Broadband so if we can get the
 
07:01:11.190 --> 07:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
federal money we want to figure out how
 
07:01:12.910 --> 07:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
to spend it so we we need to do justice
 
07:01:14.510 --> 07:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
to this and I certainly hope we retain
 
07:01:16.948 --> 07:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
the bill and bring in everybody together
 
07:01:18.590 --> 07:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
on this and get together and come up
 
07:01:20.628 --> 07:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
with a good
 
07:01:23.150 --> 07:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
plan thank you representative Harrington
 
07:01:25.910 --> 07:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
another reason to retain this bill is a
 
07:01:28.708 --> 07:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
petition was just filed with the
 
07:01:31.030 --> 07:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
puc by
 
07:01:34.310 --> 07:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Communications and
 
07:01:38.468 --> 07:01:38.478 align:start position:0%
eversource they currently own 338,000
 
07:01:42.830 --> 07:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
polls in the eversource service area
 
07:01:45.590 --> 07:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
jointly they own those polls
 
07:01:47.910 --> 07:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
5050 and the petition that was just
 
07:01:50.948 --> 07:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
filed with the PO seeks to transfer
 
07:01:56.350 --> 07:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
ownership of those polls from the 50%
 
07:01:58.948 --> 07:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
ownership of Consolidated Communications
 
07:02:01.030 --> 07:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
to eversource so that eversource would
 
07:02:02.548 --> 07:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
be the sole
 
07:02:07.350 --> 07:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
owner 338,000 polls so that might have
 
07:02:09.788 --> 07:02:09.798 align:start position:0%
some significant impact on this bill I
 
07:02:12.548 --> 07:02:12.558 align:start position:0%
think that's another argument for
 
07:02:15.350 --> 07:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill recognizes
 
07:02:19.830 --> 07:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:22.670 --> 07:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chairman and this
 
07:02:25.910 --> 07:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
is another bill where uh I am full
 
07:02:29.830 --> 07:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
agreement with representative Harrington
 
07:02:32.628 --> 07:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
I think that uh something has to be done
 
07:02:35.830 --> 07:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
here and right now the bill as written
 
07:02:39.070 --> 07:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
is basically taking the issue of who's
 
07:02:40.670 --> 07:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
paying the
 
07:02:45.270 --> 07:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
bills away from the uh broadband and
 
07:02:48.270 --> 07:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
giving it to the utilities and that's
 
07:02:52.830 --> 07:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
just as bad and we need to get the uh
 
07:02:55.468 --> 07:02:55.478 align:start position:0%
these people in the same room together
 
07:02:58.030 --> 07:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
and work out something that's a little
 
07:02:59.350 --> 07:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
fair to
 
07:03:04.510 --> 07:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:07.670 --> 07:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
retain thank you representative oxam is
 
07:03:10.708 --> 07:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:12.868 --> 07:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
comment can you hear
 
07:03:16.110 --> 07:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
me yes D thank you very much and thank
 
07:03:20.548 --> 07:03:20.558 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um yeah I we
 
07:03:22.708 --> 07:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
we have several bills that deal with
 
07:03:26.070 --> 07:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
Broadband um 153 is the the broader bill
 
07:03:27.948 --> 07:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
that SS to set up a
 
07:03:30.628 --> 07:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
commission but I I just wanted to
 
07:03:33.030 --> 07:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
highlight the point that we we
 
07:03:35.788 --> 07:03:35.798 align:start position:0%
continually talk about rural access but
 
07:03:38.830 --> 07:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
there are underserved communities also
 
07:03:41.350 --> 07:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
in urban areas in New Hampshire that
 
07:03:44.030 --> 07:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
also need to uh and their needs need to
 
07:03:47.788 --> 07:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:50.548 --> 07:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you uh is there any
 
07:03:53.110 --> 07:03:53.120 align:start position:0%

Last Call on representative uh
 
07:05:26.110 --> 07:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah excuse me I had a phone
 
07:05:29.270 --> 07:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
call that I had to take so I I vote Yes
 
07:05:32.468 --> 07:05:32.478 align:start position:0%
okay it's so face 21 to nothing that's
 
07:05:33.548 --> 07:05:33.558 align:start position:0%
what they all
 
07:05:36.670 --> 07:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
say 21 to
 
07:05:40.030 --> 07:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
nothing the motion to retain HB
 
07:05:44.708 --> 07:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
308 passes 21 to nothing there will be
 
07:05:48.270 --> 07:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
no majority or Minority Report required
 
07:05:51.750 --> 07:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
since we have retained the bill so I
 
07:05:54.750 --> 07:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
will close the exec session on HB
 
07:05:58.910 --> 07:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
308 and before we start another exec
 
07:06:01.270 --> 07:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
session I would like to have a general
 
07:06:04.430 --> 07:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
discussion about retained bills we have
 
07:06:07.548 --> 07:06:07.558 align:start position:0%
retained now I'd say at least a half a
 
07:06:11.670 --> 07:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
dozen maybe eight bills maybe even
 
07:06:11.680 --> 07:06:13.270 align:start position:0%
dozen maybe eight bills maybe even
10

07:06:13.270 --> 07:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
10
 
07:06:16.230 --> 07:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh what it is the committee's preference
 
07:06:18.110 --> 07:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
going to be with regard to how to deal
 
07:06:20.270 --> 07:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
with these retained bills we have a
 
07:06:23.190 --> 07:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
couple of choices one is we can start
 
07:06:26.110 --> 07:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
working on retain bills in the spring
 
07:06:29.628 --> 07:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
once we finish our normal legislative
 
07:06:33.350 --> 07:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
activity up until the around the 1 of
 
07:06:36.868 --> 07:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
July and the second choice would be to
 
07:06:40.670 --> 07:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
come back after the 1 of September and
 
07:06:44.948 --> 07:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
start working on retain bills in the
 
07:06:47.548 --> 07:06:47.558 align:start position:0%
fall I personally think we should get as
 
07:06:49.190 --> 07:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
many of them out of the way in the
 
07:06:52.910 --> 07:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
springtime as possible uh to reduce our
 
07:06:54.788 --> 07:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
workload in the fall but I'd like to
 
07:06:56.628 --> 07:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
hear what other people have to
 
07:07:00.510 --> 07:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
say anybody I would agree with that me
 
07:07:02.510 --> 07:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
too spring would be good I would agree
 
07:07:03.708 --> 07:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
with that if we're going to be we're
 
07:07:05.510 --> 07:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
gonna have be tied up anyways because
 
07:07:06.910 --> 07:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to be house sessions so it's
 
07:07:09.548 --> 07:07:09.558 align:start position:0%
not like uh Jackie's running off to
 
07:07:11.388 --> 07:07:11.398 align:start position:0%
Venezuela or whever she always goes for
 
07:07:13.590 --> 07:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of months on vacation she's
 
07:07:17.110 --> 07:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
gonna go down with Bruce Cancun so but I
 
07:07:18.830 --> 07:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
mean yeah let's let's do it while we can
 
07:07:20.030 --> 07:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
because we're still going to be have to
 
07:07:21.830 --> 07:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
be around for the budget hearing and
 
07:07:24.990 --> 07:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
everything else for in in May and June
 
07:07:28.030 --> 07:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
so the budget vote so I will plan to
 
07:07:31.510 --> 07:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
start scheduling uh I would like to have
 
07:07:33.708 --> 07:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
school vacation off in
 
07:07:36.990 --> 07:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
April if you look at that ditto here
 
07:07:38.548 --> 07:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
because I've already got plans for that
 
07:07:40.070 --> 07:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
vacation in April we may not be done
 
07:07:42.388 --> 07:07:42.398 align:start position:0%
with Senate
 
07:07:45.270 --> 07:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
bills in in April
 
07:07:48.190 --> 07:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm I'm looking at maybe may
 
07:07:50.628 --> 07:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
miday we could May POS possibly start
 
07:07:53.388 --> 07:07:53.398 align:start position:0%
some of these retain Bill work sessions
 
07:07:56.110 --> 07:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
so maybe miday through the end of June
 
07:07:58.868 --> 07:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
we'll see how that goes yeah Mr chairman
 
07:08:00.350 --> 07:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
I would think that during that time
 
07:08:03.590 --> 07:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
frame our normal load would go down but
 
07:08:05.910 --> 07:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
we're still going to have normal H
 
07:08:07.310 --> 07:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
regular house sessions that we have to
 
07:08:08.628 --> 07:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
hang around for that's probably a good
 
07:08:10.388 --> 07:08:10.398 align:start position:0%
time to plug it in and get as many of
 
07:08:12.110 --> 07:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
these out of the way as we
 
07:08:14.670 --> 07:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
can of course the wild card here is
 
07:08:17.990 --> 07:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to be the AV availability of space
 
07:08:23.070 --> 07:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
to hold well maybe
 
07:08:27.468 --> 07:08:27.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:30.150 --> 07:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
over I don't think C is going to be like
 
07:08:32.868 --> 07:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
a light bulb you know that gets shut on
 
07:08:35.430 --> 07:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
and off I think it's gonna linger it's
 
07:08:37.708 --> 07:08:37.718 align:start position:0%
gonna linger but we'll
 
07:08:40.670 --> 07:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
see all right thank you for that input
 
07:08:44.110 --> 07:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
now we'll open the exec session on House
 
07:08:44.120 --> 07:08:45.590 align:start position:0%
now we'll open the exec session on House
Bill

07:08:45.590 --> 07:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
07:08:48.830 --> 07:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
309 Mr chairman I think uh uh
 
07:08:52.150 --> 07:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative parsel had a question
 
07:08:54.190 --> 07:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't see that
 
07:08:57.510 --> 07:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative I'll make my comment um
 
07:08:59.548 --> 07:08:59.558 align:start position:0%
as far as availability of rooms go I
 
07:09:01.468 --> 07:09:01.478 align:start position:0%
know that there are people I would
 
07:09:03.230 --> 07:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
prefer to meeting in person I truly
 
07:09:07.388 --> 07:09:07.398 align:start position:0%
would be but I'm finding this Zoom to be
 
07:09:09.948 --> 07:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
you know when you make it's it's a I can
 
07:09:11.750 --> 07:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
see a lot of good coming out of this as
 
07:09:13.270 --> 07:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
well it would have been my first choice
 
07:09:15.548 --> 07:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
to being in a zoom conference but I mean
 
07:09:18.270 --> 07:09:18.280 align:start position:0%
if it it gets our bills out of the way
 
07:09:19.948 --> 07:09:19.958 align:start position:0%
and I would be more than happy to go
 
07:09:21.628 --> 07:09:21.638 align:start position:0%
through some of these retained bills
 
07:09:23.788 --> 07:09:23.798 align:start position:0%
through Zoom conferencing as well that's
 
07:09:26.230 --> 07:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
all okay I appreciate that comment I
 
07:09:29.430 --> 07:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
will say in reaction to that comment
 
07:09:33.230 --> 07:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
that in-person meetings work better I
 
07:09:35.310 --> 07:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
think for work sessions than Zoom
 
07:09:39.788 --> 07:09:39.798 align:start position:0%
meetings because people tend to kind of
 
07:09:42.270 --> 07:09:42.280 align:start position:0%
stomp on each other in a zoom meeting
 
07:09:44.430 --> 07:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
whereas in a in a in-person meeting I
 
07:09:46.868 --> 07:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
think that happens less often so I would
 
07:09:48.510 --> 07:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
I would gravitate toward an in-person
 
07:09:51.468 --> 07:09:51.478 align:start position:0%
meeting if we can do them but if we took
 
07:09:53.750 --> 07:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
my boots
 
07:09:58.150 --> 07:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
off thank you representative
 
07:10:01.430 --> 07:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
Kelly I have a question then the the
 
07:10:03.948 --> 07:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
clarification sure so these are going to
 
07:10:06.750 --> 07:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
be work sessions not more not hearings
 
07:10:09.388 --> 07:10:09.398 align:start position:0%
we're going to actually uh look at these
 
07:10:11.510 --> 07:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
bills individually
 
07:10:15.270 --> 07:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
and on that is correct uh the way you
 
07:10:18.430 --> 07:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
handle contained bill is you hold work
 
07:10:21.110 --> 07:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
sessions to decide what to do with it
 
07:10:24.230 --> 07:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay great thank you typically a
 
07:10:27.070 --> 07:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
retained bill would get modified some in
 
07:10:29.910 --> 07:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
some fashion before you made a decision
 
07:10:32.548 --> 07:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
one way or the other
 
07:10:35.388 --> 07:10:35.398 align:start position:0%
excellent okay so now let's open the uh
 
07:10:38.670 --> 07:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
the exec session on HB
 
07:10:41.750 --> 07:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
309 which is relative to the computation
 
07:10:44.628 --> 07:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy credits and I will
 
07:10:47.430 --> 07:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
call on representative Harrington for a
 
07:10:50.310 --> 07:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
motion I would uh make a motion ought to
 
07:10:53.270 --> 07:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:55.310 --> 07:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington moves ought to
 
07:10:57.510 --> 07:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
pass on HP
 
07:11:00.430 --> 07:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
309 representative
 
07:11:05.190 --> 07:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
PL uh Mr chair I'll second HB 309
 
07:11:08.190 --> 07:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
representative PL seconds the motion on
 
07:11:13.910 --> 07:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
o to pass motion on HB 309 is there
 
07:11:19.590 --> 07:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:22.830 --> 07:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
ssuch yes thank you Mr Mr chairman uh I
 
07:11:24.708 --> 07:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
want to thank uh representative
 
07:11:27.230 --> 07:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
Harrington for bringing this bill up uh
 
07:11:29.590 --> 07:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
I think he was very correct in assuming
 
07:11:33.230 --> 07:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
that the 20% capacity Factor was not a
 
07:11:36.548 --> 07:11:36.558 align:start position:0%
realistic number uh as one who has
 
07:11:38.468 --> 07:11:38.478 align:start position:0%
Sellar collectors on my roof I've
 
07:11:41.030 --> 07:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
measured this a couple years now I'm
 
07:11:42.190 --> 07:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
only at
 
07:11:46.708 --> 07:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
13.7% so much less than 20% so I support
 
07:11:46.718 --> 07:11:48.430 align:start position:0%
13.7% so much less than 20% so I support
this

07:11:48.430 --> 07:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:11:51.150 --> 07:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative Harrington
 
07:11:54.310 --> 07:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for com oh Peter thank
 
07:11:57.310 --> 07:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
you for the for the kind words uh but
 
07:11:59.070 --> 07:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
it's exactly what you said I mean this
 
07:12:01.388 --> 07:12:01.398 align:start position:0%
was a kind of a false uh figure it came
 
07:12:03.310 --> 07:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
up with 20% I think there was some kind
 
07:12:05.468 --> 07:12:05.478 align:start position:0%
of a legislative compromise back some
 
07:12:08.830 --> 07:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
time ago but we know that uh it's
 
07:12:10.548 --> 07:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
depending on exactly where you live I
 
07:12:12.030 --> 07:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
think you must be pretty much on the
 
07:12:16.310 --> 07:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
average at 13.7 it's 13.5 to somewhere
 
07:12:18.910 --> 07:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire close to the 14 but let's
 
07:12:20.990 --> 07:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
use the iso numbers and let's use actual
 
07:12:22.310 --> 07:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
MERS that's what we should be dealing
 
07:12:28.948 --> 07:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:32.150 --> 07:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
numbers okay thank you representative
 
07:12:37.110 --> 07:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:40.510 --> 07:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none seeing none I
 
07:12:43.948 --> 07:12:43.958 align:start position:0%

nothing so
 
07:14:12.868 --> 07:14:12.878 align:start position:0%
the motion of ought to pass on HB
 
07:14:16.788 --> 07:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
309 carries with a 21 to nothing vote
 
07:14:19.868 --> 07:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington will Author
 
07:14:22.788 --> 07:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
07:14:26.830 --> 07:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
report and without objection the bill
 
07:14:28.750 --> 07:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
will go on the consent
 
07:14:31.948 --> 07:14:31.958 align:start position:0%
calendar is that acceptable to everyone
 
07:14:34.590 --> 07:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
yeah apparently so
 
07:14:38.070 --> 07:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
okay so I will close the exec session
 
07:14:42.548 --> 07:14:42.558 align:start position:0%
now on HB 309 and open an exec session
 
07:14:45.190 --> 07:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
07:14:49.948 --> 07:14:49.958 align:start position:0%
168 and I will I will read the uh the
 
07:14:52.150 --> 07:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
name of the vill it's requiring the
 
07:14:54.070 --> 07:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
adoption of innovative vehicle emission
 
07:14:56.628 --> 07:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
standards pursuant to section 177 of the
 
07:15:00.910 --> 07:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
federal human Air Act and I recognize
 
07:15:04.350 --> 07:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
representative n for a motion this is HB
 
07:15:07.270 --> 07:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
what HB
 
07:15:12.310 --> 07:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
168 Das FN Mr chairman I move
 
07:15:16.070 --> 07:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
itl representative n moves itl
 
07:15:16.080 --> 07:15:17.868 align:start position:0%
itl representative n moves itl
representative

07:15:17.868 --> 07:15:17.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:15:21.430 --> 07:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
FL uh second representative FL seconds
 
07:15:25.070 --> 07:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
the motion of itl on HB
 
07:15:28.430 --> 07:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
168 do we have any
 
07:15:32.468 --> 07:15:32.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:36.230 --> 07:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
ssuch U thank you Mr chairman uh well I
 
07:15:38.150 --> 07:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
think it's very unfortunate that we're
 
07:15:40.750 --> 07:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
not able to see the big benefits of
 
07:15:44.388 --> 07:15:44.398 align:start position:0%
becoming part of a nationwide network of
 
07:15:47.190 --> 07:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
of of uh states that are trying to
 
07:15:49.830 --> 07:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
encourage low emission vehicles and at
 
07:15:51.948 --> 07:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
the same time give uh New Hampshire
 
07:15:55.628 --> 07:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
customers access to these vehicles uh in
 
07:15:58.150 --> 07:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
in the pursuit of trying to reduce our
 
07:16:01.030 --> 07:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
our pollution and our fuel consumption
 
07:16:04.628 --> 07:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
so uh I I won't be voting for itl
 
07:16:08.350 --> 07:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:13.430 --> 07:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:17.388 --> 07:16:17.398 align:start position:0%
cran thank you Mr chair um I agree I
 
07:16:19.190 --> 07:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
think that we heard in the testimony for
 
07:16:21.788 --> 07:16:21.798 align:start position:0%
this bill a number of consumers um
 
07:16:23.670 --> 07:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
talking about how difficult it was for
 
07:16:27.628 --> 07:16:27.638 align:start position:0%
them to um be able to test drive of this
 
07:16:29.628 --> 07:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
new technology and how important that
 
07:16:33.750 --> 07:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
that was for them um we heard testimony
 
07:16:37.750 --> 07:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
from uh car or car dealers saying that
 
07:16:39.548 --> 07:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
uh they want to be able to sell the cars
 
07:16:41.590 --> 07:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
that that people want um but that is
 
07:16:43.750 --> 07:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to do when they they don't
 
07:16:45.910 --> 07:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
have them in stock um so we're putting
 
07:16:48.548 --> 07:16:48.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at a disadvantage relative
 
07:16:51.070 --> 07:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
to our neighboring states and um I would
 
07:16:53.670 --> 07:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
like to be able to vote for for this to
 
07:16:56.670 --> 07:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:59.868 --> 07:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
retained okay thank you
 
07:17:02.868 --> 07:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
representative I'm going to uh read
 
07:17:05.388 --> 07:17:05.398 align:start position:0%
something here that I
 
07:17:09.070 --> 07:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
uh discovered the other day that I found
 
07:17:09.080 --> 07:17:11.230 align:start position:0%
uh discovered the other day that I found
absolutely

07:17:11.230 --> 07:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
07:17:15.388 --> 07:17:15.398 align:start position:0%
fascinating a Tesla lithium EV battery
 
07:17:18.590 --> 07:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
weighs more than 1,000
 
07:17:20.548 --> 07:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
pounds and it typically contains
 
07:17:24.230 --> 07:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
contains about 25 pounds of lithium 30
 
07:17:25.468 --> 07:17:25.478 align:start position:0%
pound of
 
07:17:30.190 --> 07:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
Cobalt 60 pounds of nickel 110 pounds of
 
07:17:34.548 --> 07:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
graphite and 90 pounds of
 
07:17:37.270 --> 07:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
copper in order to
 
07:17:42.590 --> 07:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
obtain those components of a typical EV
 
07:17:45.388 --> 07:17:45.398 align:start position:0%
battery you have to M something like
 
07:17:49.070 --> 07:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
25,000 pounds of brine in order to get
 
07:17:51.270 --> 07:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
25 pounds of pure
 
07:17:55.230 --> 07:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
lithium you have to mine about 30,000
 
07:17:56.548 --> 07:17:56.558 align:start position:0%
pounds of
 
07:17:59.948 --> 07:17:59.958 align:start position:0%
ore Cobalt Ore in order to get 30 pounds
 
07:17:59.958 --> 07:18:01.030 align:start position:0%
ore Cobalt Ore in order to get 30 pounds
of

07:18:01.030 --> 07:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:18:03.990 --> 07:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
cobalt you have to mine about 6,000
 
07:18:07.270 --> 07:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
pounds of nickel ore to get 60 pounds of
 
07:18:10.750 --> 07:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
nickel you have to mine about a th000
 
07:18:13.948 --> 07:18:13.958 align:start position:0%
pounds per battery of graphite ore to
 
07:18:17.510 --> 07:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
get 100 lbs of graphite and you have to
 
07:18:22.628 --> 07:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
mine 25,000 lbs of oil or copper ore in
 
07:18:25.990 --> 07:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
order to get 90 pounds of
 
07:18:28.548 --> 07:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
copper so just to produce these five
 
07:18:31.110 --> 07:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
elements to produce a 1,000 pound EV
 
07:18:33.990 --> 07:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
battery requires mining about 90,000
 
07:18:36.948 --> 07:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
pounds of
 
07:18:42.030 --> 07:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
ore and it takes a lot of fossil fuel to
 
07:18:46.990 --> 07:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
mine all that or to put together one of
 
07:18:47.000 --> 07:18:47.868 align:start position:0%
mine all that or to put together one of
these

07:18:47.868 --> 07:18:47.878 align:start position:0%
these
 
07:18:49.750 --> 07:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
batteries according to Cambridge
 
07:18:51.548 --> 07:18:51.558 align:start position:0%
University of Meritus professor of
 
07:18:54.510 --> 07:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
Technology Michael Kelly replacing all
 
07:18:56.830 --> 07:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
of the United Kingdom's 32 million light
 
07:19:00.150 --> 07:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
duty vehicles with Next Generation EVS
 
07:19:02.270 --> 07:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
would require huge quantities of
 
07:19:05.110 --> 07:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
materials more than 50% of the world's
 
07:19:06.830 --> 07:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
annual production of
 
07:19:10.150 --> 07:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
copper 200% of its annual Cobalt
 
07:19:13.548 --> 07:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
production 75% of yearly lithium
 
07:19:17.310 --> 07:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
carbonate output and nearly 100% of its
 
07:19:22.190 --> 07:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
entire annual production of Neo dim di
 
07:19:22.200 --> 07:19:23.830 align:start position:0%
entire annual production of Neo dim di
Diamond

07:19:23.830 --> 07:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
Diamond
 
07:19:23.840 --> 07:19:26.948 align:start position:0%
Diamond
Neo

07:19:26.948 --> 07:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:31.310 --> 07:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
dii three times in a r so the point I'm
 
07:19:33.788 --> 07:19:33.798 align:start position:0%
trying to make here is that it may be
 
07:19:36.708 --> 07:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
premature I think
 
07:19:40.388 --> 07:19:40.398 align:start position:0%
to assume that electric vehicles are
 
07:19:44.150 --> 07:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
going to um be ubiquitous in the in the
 
07:19:45.868 --> 07:19:45.878 align:start position:0%
near future
 
07:19:49.708 --> 07:19:49.718 align:start position:0%
because China just a few days ago
 
07:19:53.788 --> 07:19:53.798 align:start position:0%
debated whether or not to stop sending
 
07:19:56.830 --> 07:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
Rare Earth minerals to the United States
 
07:19:59.230 --> 07:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
80% of the world's Rare Earth Minal
 
07:20:00.990 --> 07:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
minerals are in
 
07:20:03.430 --> 07:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
China they want to cut off the United
 
07:20:04.910 --> 07:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
States because a lot of those minerals
 
07:20:09.468 --> 07:20:09.478 align:start position:0%
are used in the manufacturer of F35
 
07:20:15.430 --> 07:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:19.310 --> 07:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:19.320 --> 07:20:21.150 align:start position:0%
 
not

07:20:21.150 --> 07:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:20:21.160 --> 07:20:24.510 align:start position:0%
not
[Music]

07:20:24.510 --> 07:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:27.548 --> 07:20:27.558 align:start position:0%
bombing yeah so anyway the point I'm
 
07:20:30.750 --> 07:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make is uh this may not be the
 
07:20:32.670 --> 07:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
best way to go and I don't think we
 
07:20:32.680 --> 07:20:33.628 align:start position:0%
best way to go and I don't think we
should

07:20:33.628 --> 07:20:33.638 align:start position:0%
should
 
07:20:36.868 --> 07:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
be subjecting our state to a dependence
 
07:20:40.430 --> 07:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
on electric vehicles or even
 
07:20:42.708 --> 07:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
Courage the adoption of electric
 
07:20:46.708 --> 07:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
vehicles if uh if they're going to be so
 
07:20:46.718 --> 07:20:48.070 align:start position:0%
vehicles if uh if they're going to be so
resource

07:20:48.070 --> 07:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
resource
 
07:20:50.670 --> 07:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
intensive that we may not even be able
 
07:20:52.708 --> 07:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
to to go down this
 
07:20:56.590 --> 07:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
road much longer so that's why I would
 
07:20:59.350 --> 07:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
not be in favor of this particular bill
 
07:21:01.230 --> 07:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
so next up I would
 
07:21:05.830 --> 07:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:09.750 --> 07:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
Williams thank you chair Bose um I just
 
07:21:12.830 --> 07:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that um it is an honor to
 
07:21:14.948 --> 07:21:14.958 align:start position:0%
serve on science technology and energy
 
07:21:17.230 --> 07:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
with everyone here in this
 
07:21:19.708 --> 07:21:19.718 align:start position:0%
discussion and that one of the wonderful
 
07:21:21.708 --> 07:21:21.718 align:start position:0%
things about being elected officials is
 
07:21:24.510 --> 07:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
that we are able to set policy and we
 
07:21:27.510 --> 07:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
can decide how to incentivize and
 
07:21:29.788 --> 07:21:29.798 align:start position:0%
disincentivize the way that things work
 
07:21:32.830 --> 07:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
on a large scale and isn't that exciting
 
07:21:35.350 --> 07:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
so in response to your concern regarding
 
07:21:37.388 --> 07:21:37.398 align:start position:0%
U batteries and the rare earth minerals
 
07:21:39.830 --> 07:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
and components that make up batteries um
 
07:21:42.270 --> 07:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
the good news is that uh there's a whole
 
07:21:44.430 --> 07:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
group of NOS that are currently working
 
07:21:48.468 --> 07:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
on um requiring transparency in what
 
07:21:50.510 --> 07:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
goes into each of these manufacturers
 
07:21:53.708 --> 07:21:53.718 align:start position:0%
batteries and also setting Global policy
 
07:21:56.430 --> 07:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
on recycling for these manufacturers as
 
07:21:58.830 --> 07:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
well so here we are in New Hampshire
 
07:22:01.590 --> 07:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
elected officials able to set policy and
 
07:22:02.990 --> 07:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
certainly I would say that battery
 
07:22:04.830 --> 07:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
recycling is something that we have
 
07:22:06.948 --> 07:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
within our purview if we wanted to set
 
07:22:10.708 --> 07:22:10.718 align:start position:0%
that as a agenda item for the future uh
 
07:22:12.350 --> 07:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
but for right now we still haven't even
 
07:22:14.590 --> 07:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
incentivized EVS in New Hampshire
 
07:22:17.030 --> 07:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
although the rest of New England has and
 
07:22:18.430 --> 07:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
so we are certainly Suffering The
 
07:22:20.468 --> 07:22:20.478 align:start position:0%
Economic Consequences of people from New
 
07:22:21.868 --> 07:22:21.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire going to other states to
 
07:22:24.868 --> 07:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
purchase EVS because we just don't have
 
07:22:26.590 --> 07:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
them on the lots and there's not a lot
 
07:22:28.788 --> 07:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
of reason for um a manufacturer right
 
07:22:31.230 --> 07:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
now to send them uh but there are some
 
07:22:33.190 --> 07:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
Lots who are owned by dealers who choose
 
07:22:35.708 --> 07:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit more um open to new
 
07:22:37.830 --> 07:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
technology and certainly to Greener less
 
07:22:40.430 --> 07:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
air emissions technology so that being
 
07:22:42.310 --> 07:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
said um I'm not going to rehash
 
07:22:44.548 --> 07:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
everything I said in my introduction to
 
07:22:46.708 --> 07:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
this bill uh but just the future's
 
07:22:49.230 --> 07:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
watching New Hampshire's watching and
 
07:22:51.628 --> 07:22:51.638 align:start position:0%
what we do today matters for setting
 
07:22:53.830 --> 07:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
policy so thank you all for being my
 
07:22:56.430 --> 07:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues on setting policy and um I
 
07:22:58.788 --> 07:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
look forward to continuing to push for
 
07:22:58.798 --> 07:23:01.910 align:start position:0%
look forward to continuing to push for
the

07:23:01.910 --> 07:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:04.110 --> 07:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
future thank you representative MC
 
07:23:09.110 --> 07:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:12.030 --> 07:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
parshall yes thank you chair vas uh
 
07:23:14.548 --> 07:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
that's interesting about transparency uh
 
07:23:15.868 --> 07:23:15.878 align:start position:0%
interesting comment because I'm thinking
 
07:23:18.388 --> 07:23:18.398 align:start position:0%
that that's kind of transparency we need
 
07:23:20.670 --> 07:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
in technology that's not what we're
 
07:23:22.110 --> 07:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
really getting from such things as the
 
07:23:24.788 --> 07:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
fracking industry as we well know when
 
07:23:27.830 --> 07:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
they when they PL it's on a broad scale
 
07:23:28.868 --> 07:23:28.878 align:start position:0%
we don't know what they're putting in
 
07:23:31.388 --> 07:23:31.398 align:start position:0%
the pipes so this is kind of exactly the
 
07:23:32.750 --> 07:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
kind of green energy that I can see not
 
07:23:34.868 --> 07:23:34.878 align:start position:0%
only being more transparent but also
 
07:23:37.190 --> 07:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
being a boom industry for uh all these
 
07:23:40.270 --> 07:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
mining concerns and uh I'd like to see
 
07:23:43.350 --> 07:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
more industry uh if it helps us all the
 
07:23:46.308 --> 07:23:46.318 align:start position:0%
better both Ford and GM are moving to
 
07:23:49.628 --> 07:23:49.638 align:start position:0%
EVS rapidly and I assume that they're
 
07:23:51.548 --> 07:23:51.558 align:start position:0%
doing that knowing what their resources
 
07:23:54.388 --> 07:23:54.398 align:start position:0%
are I personally drive a leaf and here's
 
07:23:58.110 --> 07:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
a personal story behind that um when I
 
07:24:01.150 --> 07:24:01.160 align:start position:0%
want to pick up my leaf I was uh I asked
 
07:24:03.030 --> 07:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
the salesperson there well how many do
 
07:24:04.150 --> 07:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
you have in your lot how many can I
 
07:24:06.350 --> 07:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
choose from he says well if you want one
 
07:24:08.150 --> 07:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
we got one for you and that was the
 
07:24:10.110 --> 07:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
extent of it I either had to take what
 
07:24:13.190 --> 07:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
they had on the lot or uh continue
 
07:24:16.430 --> 07:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
driving my gas powered vehicle now I
 
07:24:20.708 --> 07:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
love my uh Nissan Leaf uh and I it's
 
07:24:21.948 --> 07:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
it's a wonderful purchase but I would
 
07:24:23.948 --> 07:24:23.958 align:start position:0%
have liken more choice and I would have
 
07:24:26.830 --> 07:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
had that kind of choice if we were um in
 
07:24:29.468 --> 07:24:29.478 align:start position:0%
competition with the rest New England to
 
07:24:31.708 --> 07:24:31.718 align:start position:0%
bring these uh bring these cars into New
 
07:24:35.190 --> 07:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for your
 
07:24:37.788 --> 07:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
time thank you next is representative
 
07:24:37.798 --> 07:24:42.468 align:start position:0%
time thank you next is representative
pem

07:24:42.468 --> 07:24:42.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:46.030 --> 07:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
Andel just muted myself uh thank you Mr
 
07:24:50.070 --> 07:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah on basically I'm probably
 
07:24:53.270 --> 07:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
iterating a little bit here but um these
 
07:24:56.430 --> 07:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
batteries are extremely recyclable it's
 
07:24:59.788 --> 07:24:59.798 align:start position:0%
almost uh maybe not 100% recyclable but
 
07:25:02.590 --> 07:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
pretty close to it so yes we are going
 
07:25:05.548 --> 07:25:05.558 align:start position:0%
to have to do a lot of mining uh the
 
07:25:10.308 --> 07:25:10.318 align:start position:0%
other thing is we really need to work at
 
07:25:14.708 --> 07:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
giving New Hampshire choices to move
 
07:25:20.670 --> 07:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
towards a low carbon source of uh of
 
07:25:24.990 --> 07:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh it's not just EVS it's
 
07:25:27.910 --> 07:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
probably hydrogen powered vehicles as
 
07:25:31.430 --> 07:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
well that uh we would like to see in the
 
07:25:33.750 --> 07:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
lots that there's not as many of those
 
07:25:37.948 --> 07:25:37.958 align:start position:0%
out there but the technology is uh is
 
07:25:40.990 --> 07:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
starting to come around and uh we
 
07:25:44.308 --> 07:25:44.318 align:start position:0%
certainly would like to expand choices
 
07:25:47.830 --> 07:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
without choices it's hard to uh to raise
 
07:25:50.350 --> 07:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
demand and I think we need to allow the
 
07:25:53.830 --> 07:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
choices so that we can raise the demand
 
07:25:57.548 --> 07:25:57.558 align:start position:0%
and get away from high carbon vehicles
 
07:25:57.558 --> 07:25:59.510 align:start position:0%
and get away from high carbon vehicles
thank

07:25:59.510 --> 07:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:26:03.468 --> 07:26:03.478 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh representative Cali
 
07:26:07.948 --> 07:26:07.958 align:start position:0%
pittz I I just wanted to say that I
 
07:26:11.590 --> 07:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
respect my colleague Rebecca but I have
 
07:26:14.350 --> 07:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
problems with some of
 
07:26:17.788 --> 07:26:17.798 align:start position:0%
the some of the premise in the bill I do
 
07:26:20.830 --> 07:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
believe that New Hampshire has a choice
 
07:26:22.670 --> 07:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
I couple of years ago I drove an
 
07:26:24.670 --> 07:26:24.680 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle and I was quite
 
07:26:27.830 --> 07:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
impressed with it and I know that if I
 
07:26:29.548 --> 07:26:29.558 align:start position:0%
go into a dealership and say no I don't
 
07:26:31.070 --> 07:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
want the blue one I want the black one
 
07:26:32.548 --> 07:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
he says I don't have a black one he'll
 
07:26:35.190 --> 07:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
go get it because dealerships work
 
07:26:37.308 --> 07:26:37.318 align:start position:0%
together they want to move
 
07:26:40.670 --> 07:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles um I think that we should be
 
07:26:42.830 --> 07:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
moving toward vehicles but I agree with
 
07:26:45.230 --> 07:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose that it's premature I
 
07:26:47.628 --> 07:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
think infrastructure in New Hampshire is
 
07:26:50.270 --> 07:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
part of our problem in a couple of years
 
07:26:53.030 --> 07:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
I think we'll be there well I hope we'll
 
07:26:55.468 --> 07:26:55.478 align:start position:0%
be there but I think that's the problem
 
07:26:58.590 --> 07:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
now is infrastructure in New Hampshire
 
07:27:01.990 --> 07:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
so I think that we should and that we
 
07:27:03.308 --> 07:27:03.318 align:start position:0%
understand from the dees that they've
 
07:27:04.788 --> 07:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
got money and things are happening with
 
07:27:08.270 --> 07:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
the Volkswagen money so I think that uh
 
07:27:10.868 --> 07:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
right now this bill is a little
 
07:27:13.150 --> 07:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
premature sorry
 
07:27:15.830 --> 07:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
Becca thank you representative uh
 
07:27:15.840 --> 07:27:18.708 align:start position:0%
Becca thank you representative uh
representative

07:27:18.708 --> 07:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:18.718 --> 07:27:20.948 align:start position:0%
 
ssuch

07:27:20.948 --> 07:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
ssuch
 
07:27:23.948 --> 07:27:23.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um well I was
 
07:27:27.190 --> 07:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
interested to hear your comments um
 
07:27:29.750 --> 07:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
however as a physicist I read these
 
07:27:31.830 --> 07:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
articles constantly and there's always
 
07:27:34.308 --> 07:27:34.318 align:start position:0%
new technologies coming out and there's
 
07:27:36.948 --> 07:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
many people who have different opinions
 
07:27:39.388 --> 07:27:39.398 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is uh the world's
 
07:27:42.308 --> 07:27:42.318 align:start position:0%
car makers have already decided what the
 
07:27:44.788 --> 07:27:44.798 align:start position:0%
business Market is going to look like
 
07:27:46.990 --> 07:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the world is also moving
 
07:27:50.308 --> 07:27:50.318 align:start position:0%
ahead in this direction so that's
 
07:27:53.270 --> 07:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
undisputable uh also we have other
 
07:27:55.590 --> 07:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
Technologies like was mentioned before
 
07:27:58.070 --> 07:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are already
 
07:28:01.388 --> 07:28:01.398 align:start position:0%
available in California and that is is
 
07:28:03.948 --> 07:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
something much more easier to handle
 
07:28:06.948 --> 07:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
than even the lithium ion batteries so
 
07:28:09.510 --> 07:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh and and in addition Battery
 
07:28:11.388 --> 07:28:11.398 align:start position:0%
Technology is getting better all the
 
07:28:14.030 --> 07:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
time uh they're going away from rare
 
07:28:17.070 --> 07:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
earth materials uh now the newest thing
 
07:28:20.350 --> 07:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
is zinc oxide Nano bubbles as being a
 
07:28:22.628 --> 07:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
replacement and these materials are
 
07:28:25.388 --> 07:28:25.398 align:start position:0%
available to us readily everywhere so
 
07:28:27.910 --> 07:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to change dramatically uh
 
07:28:32.230 --> 07:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
so um and if we look at the fact that
 
07:28:34.948 --> 07:28:34.958 align:start position:0%
our offshore wind generation might
 
07:28:38.030 --> 07:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
produce not just uh electricity but also
 
07:28:40.030 --> 07:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
hydrogen uh there's all kinds of
 
07:28:42.190 --> 07:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities so I think there's no
 
07:28:44.308 --> 07:28:44.318 align:start position:0%
reason to be pessimistic about this
 
07:28:44.318 --> 07:28:45.590 align:start position:0%
reason to be pessimistic about this
thank

07:28:45.590 --> 07:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:28:48.510 --> 07:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative
 
07:28:52.708 --> 07:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh thank you Mr chair um I'm glad
 
07:28:55.030 --> 07:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
represent s has brought up the hydrogen
 
07:28:58.430 --> 07:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
I recently attended via Zoom a uh
 
07:29:00.868 --> 07:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
seminar on the
 
07:29:05.150 --> 07:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
northeast um I guess opening if you will
 
07:29:06.750 --> 07:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh of
 
07:29:09.430 --> 07:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
um I forget the the association but it
 
07:29:12.350 --> 07:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
was about hydrogen producers and and how
 
07:29:16.150 --> 07:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
they were uh citing that they were
 
07:29:18.110 --> 07:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
opening up the Northeast to hydrogen
 
07:29:20.230 --> 07:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
development for the purpose
 
07:29:22.590 --> 07:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
in many ways uh for vehicles but more
 
07:29:26.070 --> 07:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
importantly for industrial equipment and
 
07:29:29.750 --> 07:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh I can say now that at least 25 years
 
07:29:31.990 --> 07:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
ago I always said I'm going to wait for
 
07:29:33.868 --> 07:29:33.878 align:start position:0%
the hydrogen car to come along because I
 
07:29:36.510 --> 07:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
thought that was a good deal and so I'm
 
07:29:39.868 --> 07:29:39.878 align:start position:0%
I'm optimistic about hydrogen and uh and
 
07:29:40.948 --> 07:29:40.958 align:start position:0%
the use
 
07:29:44.468 --> 07:29:44.478 align:start position:0%
in vehicles so again I do believe this
 
07:29:47.468 --> 07:29:47.478 align:start position:0%
is premature which is why voting for
 
07:29:49.948 --> 07:29:49.958 align:start position:0%
ideal but I think hydrogen is
 
07:29:55.910 --> 07:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:59.948 --> 07:29:59.958 align:start position:0%
what uh representative McGee is next
 
07:30:04.030 --> 07:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so I I just
 
07:30:06.788 --> 07:30:06.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to say the bill is actually for
 
07:30:09.948 --> 07:30:09.958 align:start position:0%
Lev ANZ so low emission Vehicles as well
 
07:30:13.628 --> 07:30:13.638 align:start position:0%
as zero emission vehicles um in talking
 
07:30:15.670 --> 07:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
with just my colleagues on the
 
07:30:18.868 --> 07:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
Democratic caucus of STNA I I don't know
 
07:30:20.548 --> 07:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
how many folks FKS have either a low
 
07:30:22.788 --> 07:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
emission vehicle or a zero emission
 
07:30:25.708 --> 07:30:25.718 align:start position:0%
vehicle but can you raise your hands
 
07:30:27.948 --> 07:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
because there's quite a few of us I
 
07:30:32.110 --> 07:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
think everybody right look even Nick so
 
07:30:35.030 --> 07:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
so my point is you may have the
 
07:30:37.670 --> 07:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
perception that it's premature I have an
 
07:30:39.868 --> 07:30:39.878 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle there are supercharging
 
07:30:42.110 --> 07:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
stations on the way to conquered on both
 
07:30:44.910 --> 07:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
sides and hooks it uh and there's a you
 
07:30:46.548 --> 07:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
know bunch of places where you can plug
 
07:30:49.468 --> 07:30:49.478 align:start position:0%
in I went to the coast not too long ago
 
07:30:51.030 --> 07:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a break be you know
 
07:30:53.788 --> 07:30:53.798 align:start position:0%
after the elections and the place that I
 
07:30:56.270 --> 07:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
stayed had a charging station for my
 
07:30:58.868 --> 07:30:58.878 align:start position:0%
vehicle I have a charging station in
 
07:31:00.868 --> 07:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
it's really not a problem the car
 
07:31:02.628 --> 07:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't run out it's not like it's a
 
07:31:04.548 --> 07:31:04.558 align:start position:0%
Tonka toy you know I mean they're very
 
07:31:06.868 --> 07:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
welld designed they've come a long way
 
07:31:09.830 --> 07:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
so the idea that we as a science
 
07:31:11.230 --> 07:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
committee are talking about the
 
07:31:13.070 --> 07:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
technology and saying well wait a minute
 
07:31:15.510 --> 07:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
we need to be cautious we are the dut
 
07:31:17.670 --> 07:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
hole in the region and that was covered
 
07:31:20.548 --> 07:31:20.558 align:start position:0%
in the testimony and car manufacturers
 
07:31:22.788 --> 07:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
are all coming out every day there's a
 
07:31:25.868 --> 07:31:25.878 align:start position:0%
new major car manufacturer saying the
 
07:31:27.830 --> 07:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
date by which all their cars will no
 
07:31:30.350 --> 07:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
longer be combustible engines so it
 
07:31:33.030 --> 07:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
isn't future it's it's now it's
 
07:31:34.910 --> 07:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
something that from a policy standpoint
 
07:31:36.468 --> 07:31:36.478 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be preparing for at
 
07:31:39.548 --> 07:31:39.558 align:start position:0%
this moment so I I disagree that it's
 
07:31:43.030 --> 07:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's premature to to just say that New
 
07:31:45.350 --> 07:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wants to open up its dealers
 
07:31:48.830 --> 07:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
to having Les and zevs available so more
 
07:31:51.150 --> 07:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
people can access them because as is
 
07:31:53.070 --> 07:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
Testament we didn't all consult each
 
07:31:55.788 --> 07:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
other when we bought our latest Vehicles
 
07:31:57.948 --> 07:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
it just happened because we want to be
 
07:32:00.388 --> 07:32:00.398 align:start position:0%
contributing to lowered emissions and
 
07:32:02.628 --> 07:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
we're not the only ones so that would be
 
07:32:04.990 --> 07:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
my argument against iing a bill that is
 
07:32:07.510 --> 07:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
clearly uh
 
07:32:10.430 --> 07:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
relevant thank you uh representative
 
07:32:14.868 --> 07:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:18.910 --> 07:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
recognized okay thank you very much um
 
07:32:22.388 --> 07:32:22.398 align:start position:0%
and in as each person speak something
 
07:32:23.990 --> 07:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to say get said and so I
 
07:32:25.830 --> 07:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
have to drop that out now I have to to
 
07:32:29.868 --> 07:32:29.878 align:start position:0%
revamp where I am as to the donnut hole
 
07:32:33.308 --> 07:32:33.318 align:start position:0%
not only is this an issue about selling
 
07:32:36.510 --> 07:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
Vehicles we have a thriving tourism
 
07:32:38.990 --> 07:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
business that is an essential part of
 
07:32:42.708 --> 07:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's economy there are t
 
07:32:46.150 --> 07:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
there great infrastructure for zevs in
 
07:32:50.270 --> 07:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont in Maine in Quebec in New York
 
07:32:53.308 --> 07:32:53.318 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts we are the dnut hole
 
07:32:55.430 --> 07:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
people planning their vacation say oh
 
07:32:58.750 --> 07:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
avoid New Hampshire let's not go to New
 
07:33:01.788 --> 07:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this this is this is not being
 
07:33:05.308 --> 07:33:05.318 align:start position:0%
forward-looking this is not being um the
 
07:33:07.830 --> 07:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
Science and Technology Energy committee
 
07:33:09.990 --> 07:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
policymaking instrument that I think we
 
07:33:12.868 --> 07:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
should be I certainly support this bill
 
07:33:15.468 --> 07:33:15.478 align:start position:0%
hope you will
 
07:33:18.110 --> 07:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
too thank you representative Harrington
 
07:33:21.670 --> 07:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:23.910 --> 07:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
comment just sort of a general comment
 
07:33:24.990 --> 07:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
on a lot of the things we've been
 
07:33:26.510 --> 07:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
talking about we've heard now we've been
 
07:33:28.510 --> 07:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
hearing for for many many hearings about
 
07:33:30.468 --> 07:33:30.478 align:start position:0%
how New Hampshire's the dut hole New
 
07:33:31.910 --> 07:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's behind all these other
 
07:33:33.510 --> 07:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
states are so much more Progressive and
 
07:33:36.070 --> 07:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
better than we are you I look around and
 
07:33:38.350 --> 07:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
you know this summer I was up in North
 
07:33:39.830 --> 07:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
Conway and they were telling me it was
 
07:33:42.190 --> 07:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
the busiest summer they ever had and all
 
07:33:43.750 --> 07:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
these people from Massachusetts were
 
07:33:45.548 --> 07:33:45.558 align:start position:0%
just pouring up there from New York and
 
07:33:47.750 --> 07:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and New Jersey and they were
 
07:33:49.750 --> 07:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
all coming to New Hampshire and you know
 
07:33:51.750 --> 07:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
we have the lowest unemployment rate and
 
07:33:54.190 --> 07:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
the best economy of all the New England
 
07:33:55.990 --> 07:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
states so I'm just kind of getting sick
 
07:33:58.030 --> 07:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
and tired of hearing that we're behind
 
07:34:00.468 --> 07:34:00.478 align:start position:0%
everybody else no we're the Envy of the
 
07:34:01.708 --> 07:34:01.718 align:start position:0%
rest of New
 
07:34:04.590 --> 07:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
England we had low covid rates was the
 
07:34:08.070 --> 07:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:12.548 --> 07:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
were okay representative recogniz
 
07:34:18.070 --> 07:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:18.080 --> 07:34:21.230 align:start position:0%
 
comment

07:34:21.230 --> 07:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:23.190 --> 07:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
call it but representative um Sherman
 
07:34:25.628 --> 07:34:25.638 align:start position:0%
vks but uh representative Herington I
 
07:34:27.548 --> 07:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody was disparaging New
 
07:34:29.430 --> 07:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire generally I think we're
 
07:34:32.190 --> 07:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
focusing on a specific uh individual
 
07:34:33.708 --> 07:34:33.718 align:start position:0%
Point here and I think this is a point
 
07:34:35.628 --> 07:34:35.638 align:start position:0%
that we'll make New Hampshire an even
 
07:34:37.510 --> 07:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
more attractive place to live I know it
 
07:34:40.388 --> 07:34:40.398 align:start position:0%
would be for me and I would also like to
 
07:34:41.948 --> 07:34:41.958 align:start position:0%
answer another comment that was made
 
07:34:44.430 --> 07:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
earlier about the availability of these
 
07:34:47.430 --> 07:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
cars yes I could have waited four to six
 
07:34:48.788 --> 07:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
months to get the kind of car that I
 
07:34:48.798 --> 07:34:50.750 align:start position:0%
months to get the kind of car that I
want

07:34:50.750 --> 07:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
want
 
07:34:54.350 --> 07:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
but why you know I live in a in an age
 
07:34:55.948 --> 07:34:55.958 align:start position:0%
of instant gratification was there in
 
07:34:58.070 --> 07:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
the lot or waight and I want to start
 
07:35:00.910 --> 07:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
driving it right away I would just like
 
07:35:02.628 --> 07:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
to have the same options that people
 
07:35:04.788 --> 07:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
have in all the other states around us
 
07:35:06.628 --> 07:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's the donut hole is we're
 
07:35:09.788 --> 07:35:09.798 align:start position:0%
not availing ourself of being on The
 
07:35:11.868 --> 07:35:11.878 align:start position:0%
Cutting Edge of Technology if we choose
 
07:35:13.590 --> 07:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
to be not everybody's going to choose to
 
07:35:15.948 --> 07:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
go there but this is about choice and I
 
07:35:17.910 --> 07:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
think it's about making a good choice
 
07:35:20.868 --> 07:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
07:35:23.430 --> 07:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
07:35:27.230 --> 07:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
Bernardi yes thank you Mr chairman
 
07:35:32.670 --> 07:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
uh I want to just uh uh payback off off
 
07:35:34.788 --> 07:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
of Representative Harrington's comments
 
07:35:37.670 --> 07:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
I do not think we're the donnut hole and
 
07:35:39.990 --> 07:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
you folks in the Democratic caucus
 
07:35:42.590 --> 07:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
validated that you all put your hands up
 
07:35:46.150 --> 07:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
and said I've got my electric vehicle
 
07:35:47.510 --> 07:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
flavor it
 
07:35:49.910 --> 07:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
07:35:52.190 --> 07:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative CIP pit said if you want
 
07:35:54.788 --> 07:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
to get one you go to the dealership and
 
07:35:57.510 --> 07:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
say I want this the dealership will go
 
07:36:00.388 --> 07:36:00.398 align:start position:0%
to main Mass if they don't have it bring
 
07:36:02.708 --> 07:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
it up you'll have it I know that's how
 
07:36:05.230 --> 07:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
dealerships work I don't believe we need
 
07:36:08.230 --> 07:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
to set punitive standards here against
 
07:36:10.750 --> 07:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
dealerships in order to make this happen
 
07:36:13.388 --> 07:36:13.398 align:start position:0%
the market will make it happen if people
 
07:36:15.628 --> 07:36:15.638 align:start position:0%
want it if they don't want it they won't
 
07:36:15.638 --> 07:36:17.868 align:start position:0%
want it if they don't want it they won't
be

07:36:17.868 --> 07:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:36:20.590 --> 07:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
there representative BR is recognized
 
07:36:22.750 --> 07:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
for her comment uh thank you Mr chairman
 
07:36:25.150 --> 07:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
my comment is very short this uh this
 
07:36:27.308 --> 07:36:27.318 align:start position:0%
bill grows government and I don't think
 
07:36:29.308 --> 07:36:29.318 align:start position:0%
we need to go grow government in order
 
07:36:32.070 --> 07:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
to sell EVS in neire thank
 
07:36:37.830 --> 07:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:40.230 --> 07:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
C just want to correct something not
 
07:36:42.708 --> 07:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
every Democrat raised their hand because
 
07:36:45.628 --> 07:36:45.638 align:start position:0%
I'm a poor Democrat and I couldn't
 
07:36:49.030 --> 07:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
afford I could not afford a car and I
 
07:36:52.750 --> 07:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
wonder about people in my class elderly
 
07:36:55.830 --> 07:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
people people living on on fixed incomes
 
07:36:59.150 --> 07:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
these cars are very expensive
 
07:37:03.628 --> 07:37:03.638 align:start position:0%
and there's not many of them around so I
 
07:37:06.590 --> 07:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
right now if you want one you can get it
 
07:37:09.110 --> 07:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
and the proof is that there were plenty
 
07:37:11.830 --> 07:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
of people who raised their hand so I I
 
07:37:13.948 --> 07:37:13.958 align:start position:0%
just make my
 
07:37:16.468 --> 07:37:16.478 align:start position:0%
point okay thank you representative C
 
07:37:18.110 --> 07:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
pitz representative Harrington you're
 
07:37:20.070 --> 07:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
07:37:23.350 --> 07:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
comment yeah I'm just you know these
 
07:37:25.510 --> 07:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
cars they're out there they're available
 
07:37:28.548 --> 07:37:28.558 align:start position:0%
and I've got uh thou I mean like all of
 
07:37:30.910 --> 07:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
us we get hundreds bab it's working on
 
07:37:33.350 --> 07:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
thousands of emails a week now on all
 
07:37:35.750 --> 07:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
sorts of different things I've never had
 
07:37:38.150 --> 07:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
a single email from not only my own
 
07:37:39.910 --> 07:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
constituents from anyone in New
 
07:37:41.590 --> 07:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from anyone any place that
 
07:37:44.030 --> 07:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
said we are having a hard time buying an
 
07:37:47.110 --> 07:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
electric car so I just don't I just
 
07:37:49.430 --> 07:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
don't buy that argument don't get there
 
07:37:51.628 --> 07:37:51.638 align:start position:0%
people right off that I was reading a a
 
07:37:53.590 --> 07:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
fascinating study just a couple of days
 
07:37:55.990 --> 07:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
ago came out of California I think it
 
07:38:00.110 --> 07:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
was Northern California they studied uh
 
07:38:03.868 --> 07:38:03.878 align:start position:0%
the number of kilowatt hours at homes
 
07:38:07.230 --> 07:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
that bought electric vehicles versus
 
07:38:08.910 --> 07:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
their usage before they bought the
 
07:38:14.150 --> 07:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle and they also studied
 
07:38:17.468 --> 07:38:17.478 align:start position:0%
uh driving patterns and they discovered
 
07:38:19.990 --> 07:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
that most Electric vehicles are
 
07:38:22.070 --> 07:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
considered by most families at least in
 
07:38:26.070 --> 07:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
California as a second car uh it's not
 
07:38:27.670 --> 07:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
their primary vehicle they use their
 
07:38:29.308 --> 07:38:29.318 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle
 
07:38:32.430 --> 07:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
for I don't know maybe pleasure driving
 
07:38:36.468 --> 07:38:36.478 align:start position:0%
or short around town driving um so even
 
07:38:38.270 --> 07:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
in California apparently they don't rely
 
07:38:40.190 --> 07:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
on their cars they're their electric car
 
07:38:43.388 --> 07:38:43.398 align:start position:0%
is their primary vehicle uh
 
07:38:46.388 --> 07:38:46.398 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams no sorry
 
07:38:49.548 --> 07:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
representative cam brils yes I just like
 
07:38:52.548 --> 07:38:52.558 align:start position:0%
to point out that this bill assumes that
 
07:38:55.430 --> 07:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
availability is going to increase demand
 
07:38:58.230 --> 07:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
when in actuality it's demand that will
 
07:38:58.240 --> 07:38:59.628 align:start position:0%
when in actuality it's demand that will
increase

07:38:59.628 --> 07:38:59.638 align:start position:0%
increase
 
07:39:02.308 --> 07:39:02.318 align:start position:0%
availability the market
 
07:39:05.990 --> 07:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
work okay representative MC
 
07:39:08.070 --> 07:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
Williams I just want to address a couple
 
07:39:09.830 --> 07:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
of points that have been brought up um
 
07:39:11.388 --> 07:39:11.398 align:start position:0%
first there was the concern about this
 
07:39:14.270 --> 07:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
bill being punitive um yes there is
 
07:39:16.670 --> 07:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
language in this bill that threatens uh
 
07:39:20.830 --> 07:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
a fine if the requirements are not met
 
07:39:23.230 --> 07:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
however historically looking at all the
 
07:39:25.750 --> 07:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
states around us in New England and this
 
07:39:28.350 --> 07:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
potentially punitive requirement no
 
07:39:31.030 --> 07:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
other state has issued a fine in the
 
07:39:32.830 --> 07:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
time that they have been adopting have
 
07:39:34.788 --> 07:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
have had these regs and that's over 10
 
07:39:37.190 --> 07:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
years no one has been fined for that so
 
07:39:39.270 --> 07:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
while it's on the books it hasn't
 
07:39:41.670 --> 07:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
actually come to the point where uh
 
07:39:43.670 --> 07:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
there is a fine issued for for failing
 
07:39:45.150 --> 07:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
to meet that requirement so that's Point
 
07:39:47.308 --> 07:39:47.318 align:start position:0%
number one um Point number two we're
 
07:39:49.110 --> 07:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
talking about a chicken and egg problem
 
07:39:51.230 --> 07:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
here so saying that there isn't enough
 
07:39:52.750 --> 07:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the state of New
 
07:39:55.150 --> 07:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in order to push for Zev and
 
07:39:57.628 --> 07:39:57.638 align:start position:0%
LS and that includes both hydrogen and
 
07:40:00.590 --> 07:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
electric um that that kind of begs the
 
07:40:02.230 --> 07:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
question of well do we need to get more
 
07:40:04.270 --> 07:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
cars in New Hampshire before we focus on
 
07:40:06.190 --> 07:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
more infrastructure do we need to get
 
07:40:07.788 --> 07:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
more infrastructure before we focus on
 
07:40:09.548 --> 07:40:09.558 align:start position:0%
more cars the answer is we need both
 
07:40:11.990 --> 07:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's not just one or the other um and
 
07:40:14.990 --> 07:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
then finally I I just I have a a
 
07:40:16.948 --> 07:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
fundamental concern saying that this
 
07:40:19.468 --> 07:40:19.478 align:start position:0%
increases the size of government
 
07:40:21.910 --> 07:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about one more staffer
 
07:40:24.990 --> 07:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
at Dees to manage the program this is
 
07:40:26.948 --> 07:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
forward thinking this is something that
 
07:40:28.510 --> 07:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to have either way we're
 
07:40:30.350 --> 07:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
going to have someone who's in charge of
 
07:40:32.830 --> 07:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
tracking what happens with Zev and LS
 
07:40:34.548 --> 07:40:34.558 align:start position:0%
because let's be honest it is the wave
 
07:40:36.150 --> 07:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
of the future it's what manufacturers
 
07:40:38.270 --> 07:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
are creating and at some point this
 
07:40:40.590 --> 07:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
legislative body will pass some kind of
 
07:40:43.270 --> 07:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
a bill to address the road usage fees
 
07:40:44.948 --> 07:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
probably not within this committee but
 
07:40:47.468 --> 07:40:47.478 align:start position:0%
who knows uh so we will need to have
 
07:40:50.230 --> 07:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
someone Staffing to address new modern
 
07:40:52.670 --> 07:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles either way so it is a potential
 
07:40:55.030 --> 07:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
for double dipping and the staff time is
 
07:41:02.628 --> 07:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:05.110 --> 07:41:05.120 align:start position:0%

07:43:57.990 --> 07:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
for HB 168 so we'll close that exact
 
07:44:00.948 --> 07:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
session and I'll recognize uh
 
07:44:02.948 --> 07:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas who has some
 
07:44:04.308 --> 07:44:04.318 align:start position:0%
information about something that
 
07:44:07.350 --> 07:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
happened earlier today yes earlier this
 
07:44:09.708 --> 07:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
morning it was pointed out I hadn't seen
 
07:44:12.708 --> 07:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
the calendar yet but it was uh now I
 
07:44:14.868 --> 07:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
have it was pointed out that the vote
 
07:44:18.350 --> 07:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
totals for 614 and 624 were incorrect in
 
07:44:21.270 --> 07:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
the calendar I asked our research person
 
07:44:28.388 --> 07:44:28.398 align:start position:0%
to check into that and for um for
 
07:44:33.110 --> 07:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
624 uh the clerk that is Paul Smith came
 
07:44:37.150 --> 07:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
back and said yes it was AAL error the
 
07:44:43.230 --> 07:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
vot toal should be 11 to9 instead of
 
07:44:48.308 --> 07:44:48.318 align:start position:0%
191 so they're aware of that 614 I'm I'm
 
07:44:51.308 --> 07:44:51.318 align:start position:0%
not entirely they're still checking that
 
07:44:54.910 --> 07:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
I not show theol should be 11 to 10 but
 
07:44:56.430 --> 07:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
I I don't
 
07:44:59.468 --> 07:44:59.478 align:start position:0%
have I can't go back and verify that
 
07:45:03.190 --> 07:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
so represent VIN on a couple of those V
 
07:45:05.030 --> 07:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's possible yes we were they were take
 
07:45:07.830 --> 07:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
it on the same day I missed him on a
 
07:45:13.628 --> 07:45:13.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:16.190 --> 07:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
that yeah Mr chairman if you remember
 
07:45:18.948 --> 07:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
that was the bill that had a tend to tie
 
07:45:18.958 --> 07:45:20.150 align:start position:0%
that was the bill that had a tend to tie
tie

07:45:20.150 --> 07:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
tie
 
07:45:22.750 --> 07:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
initially and we came back in the next
 
07:45:25.110 --> 07:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
hearing and there was a reconsideration
 
07:45:31.708 --> 07:45:31.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:31.718 --> 07:45:37.948 align:start position:0%
 
10

07:45:37.948 --> 07:45:37.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:41.830 --> 07:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay that's what's in the calendar is
 
07:45:46.990 --> 07:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:49.350 --> 07:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
no two
 
07:45:52.350 --> 07:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
votes and and we had an
 
07:45:55.590 --> 07:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that was passed 12 to8 and
 
07:45:59.548 --> 07:45:59.558 align:start position:0%
after that was otpa 11
 
07:46:01.830 --> 07:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
to9 but that's what it says in the
 
07:46:05.590 --> 07:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
calendar 11 119 is correct was a
 
07:46:08.590 --> 07:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
question about both v no
 
07:46:08.600 --> 07:46:11.308 align:start position:0%
question about both v no
no

07:46:11.308 --> 07:46:11.318 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:46:14.388 --> 07:46:14.398 align:start position:0%
yes that's what the calendar says I know
 
07:46:16.990 --> 07:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
best way to do it is read off who voted
 
07:46:21.468 --> 07:46:21.478 align:start position:0%
what well I'm sure we have it okay well
 
07:46:24.910 --> 07:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
it appears now there was one uh typo in
 
07:46:28.230 --> 07:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
the calendar and one bill that is listed
 
07:46:30.708 --> 07:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
correctly yeah so that's that's what
 
07:46:32.510 --> 07:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas wanted to inform
 
07:46:34.990 --> 07:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
you all about would have been solved if
 
07:46:36.708 --> 07:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
we didn't reconsider when you told us
 
07:46:39.190 --> 07:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
you weren't going to reconsider
 
07:46:41.948 --> 07:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
it thank you for that uh representative
 
07:46:44.350 --> 07:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
