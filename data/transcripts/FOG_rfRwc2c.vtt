00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
with a delivery we ended up making new
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
food for that customer but we still got
 
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
a bad review
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
and when i reached out to ubereats they
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
said unless the customer contracted
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
contacted them they couldn't refund the
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
customer so
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
i had to do it we lost cost twice
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
plus we lost a potential customer
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh and one other
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
anecdote from that same article
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
was the owner of restoration cafe also
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
in manchester quoted as saying
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh in our case the
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
incorrect menu that was two years old
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
with incorrect pricing and items showing
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
on the menu were no longer carried plus
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
it was full of typos
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
it ends up making me look like an idiot
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh and just this past weekend i saw uh
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
on instagram
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh roots vegan cafe and juice bar in
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
dover they shared uh that it's come to
 
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
our attention that we've been added to
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
grubhub and or doordash
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
we didn't do this and we can't fulfill
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
these orders because we are only open on
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
select days for the time being our
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
apologies to everyone who has been
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
placing roots orders
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
through these third-party delivery
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
services we had no idea this was
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
happening until today
 
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.830 align:start position:0%
happening until today
so

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
this is an urgent issue it's facing
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
small business owners who are under
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
enormous pressure due to the pandemic
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
bad online reviews can lead
 
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
directly to a decrease in orders which
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
can lead to a restaurant's closure
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
especially in these challenging and
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
uncertain economic times
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
so i urge you my colleagues to send
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
house bill 593 to the full house with
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
the unanimous recommendation of ought to
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
pass so that we can stand up for small
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
business owners across new hampshire who
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
are being taken advantage of by
 
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.550 align:start position:0%
are being taken advantage of by
out-of-state

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
out-of-state
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
funded by venture capitalists in silicon
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
valley who will gladly turn a profit on
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
the backs of new hampshire's restaurant
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
owners even if it tarnishes their
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
reputation or puts a few out of business
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
in the process let's put power back in
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
the hands of small business owners to
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
would that interfere in any way with the
 
00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:06.949 align:start position:0%
would that interfere in any way with the
restaurant

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
having an employee make the deliveries
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
question uh this bill would not
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
interfere with
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
a restaurant having their own employees
 
00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:18.550 align:start position:0%
a restaurant having their own employees
make

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
deliveries for their restaurant it you
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
know if a pizza place had
 
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
had uh employees making deliveries
 
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.190 align:start position:0%
had uh employees making deliveries
uh

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's totally fine this is really just
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
question representative just a quick
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
question um my understanding is mostly
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
delivery services take on the on the
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
order of 30
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
of the of the bill
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
um so how does it work if they're you
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
know if they're taking these orders
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
unsolicited offline how does
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
how does the money get distributed in
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
that scenario are they so are they i
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
guess the question is are the
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants automatically forced to take
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
a 30 discount if they do it without a
 
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.269 align:start position:0%
a 30 discount if they do it without a
contract

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
 
00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:10.310 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
uh

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
my understandings is that each of these
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
delivery services
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh have different arrangements
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
which is why it's important that
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
restaurants get
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
things in writing they need to know
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
exactly what the financial arrangement
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
is so i think they all look a little bit
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
different so i can't speak to them kind
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
of in a blanket
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
setting but i
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
i do think it's important that that
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
restaurant owners
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
know what they're getting themselves
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
into when they're contracting with a
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
third-party delivery service
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%

00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely hounded them to stop putting
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
us on their website they were doing us
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
no favors even before the pandemic
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
i ended up having to sue them and you
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%

new hampshire restaurants and we won
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
they settled
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
because they knew they were wrong
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
these these national and even
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
international companies are coming into
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
our little state of new hampshire
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
robbing these mom-and-pop
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh locations
 
00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.470 align:start position:0%
uh locations
of

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
their profit
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
and believe me when i tell you
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're a big player and
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
we're fine
 
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.910 align:start position:0%
we're fine
but

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
these other these other organizations
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
they can't afford this 30 fee
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
so to answer
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh another representative's question
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
if you contract with them you have the
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
choice to contract with them they will
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
charge you a marketing fee
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
an administrative fee
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
of course the meals and rentals fee
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
and the delivery fee
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
and the tip
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
so i went i played a dummy customer
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday and i went to backyard brewery
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
which is in
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
manchester i ordered their 16
 
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.750 align:start position:0%
manchester i ordered their 16
cheeseburger

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
cheeseburger
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
when all said and done it was twenty
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
backyard brewery is not making a penny
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
restaurants make between three and five
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
cents of every dollar they take in
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
and during this pandemic
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
we're on the ropes
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
we're on the ropes and these people are
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
taking complete advantage
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
of these small restaurants
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
and it's it's disgusting to me to be
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
honest with you and i'm not i'm not
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
someone that wants to litigate i'm not
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
someone wants to create onerous
 
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.069 align:start position:0%
someone wants to create onerous
laws

00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
but we need a law to outlaw these these
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
companies from
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
literally stealing money from
 
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.269 align:start position:0%
literally stealing money from
restaurants

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
during this time and quite frankly
 
00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:56.150 align:start position:0%
during this time and quite frankly
forever

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
forever
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
um all we're asking for is a law so that
 
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.389 align:start position:0%
um all we're asking for is a law so that
other

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
small mom-and-pop
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
restaurants don't have to go through
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
what we went through we spent thousands
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
of dollars to litigate this we won
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
we didn't win a lot it barely covered
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
our our uh attorney fees
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
but you know what
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
we're off their sites and we're going to
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
be off their sites forever and if they
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
put us back on
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
they're they're in they're in for a
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
major lawsuit so
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
to end
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
by passing this law we're not asking
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
the state to enforce it what it does is
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
it creates
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
an avenue a very easy avenue for a
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant to say
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
stop putting me on your website
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's illegal here's the law here's the
 
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.350 align:start position:0%
it's illegal here's the law here's the
statute

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
and then if it continues
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
they'll have a class action lawsuit from
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
thousands of restaurants
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
and then they'll stop
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's not right it's not right they
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
cannot use my brand my name my
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
trademarks to profit off of i have no
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
control once that food leaves my
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
building i have no control are they
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
opening the bag and eating french fries
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i've read that online
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
are they
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
are they delivering it on time not a lot
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's just it's it's just terrible
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm not willing to risk our 36-year
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
reputation on this on these third-party
 
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.789 align:start position:0%

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for taking my
 
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.750 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for taking my
question

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
my question is do other states um like
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
in new england especially have similar
 
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.549 align:start position:0%
in new england especially have similar
laws

00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
are there
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
other precedents within the state and
 
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
other states
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
wording and stuff for this bill has come
 
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.350 align:start position:0%
wording and stuff for this bill has come
from

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
um well uh the answer is yes i'm not
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
sure about new england but i know
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
california recently passed it
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
and i i will tell you that
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i see some other restaurant tours on
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
here restaurants are struggling right
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
now i mean this is so hard this is a
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
heavy lift for them to get
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
get this up on the plate if they could
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'll bet
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of restaurant tours would be on
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
this call right now and i'm fortunate
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
enough that i can
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
stand here and represent our company and
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully hundreds of others
 
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.510 align:start position:0%
hopefully hundreds of others
it's

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's an impossible task for them to find
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
the time to bring it to all of you all
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
of your attention but the answer is yes
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
california recently passed the uh almost
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
the identical law
 
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh next up is representative
 
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.630 align:start position:0%
okay uh next up is representative
greeson

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
mr boucher for testifying this morning
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
had you received any demands for payment
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
for these uh marketing fees and such
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
like that from from any of these
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
companies you said that they were using
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
your logos and
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
uh trademarked materials and stuff menus
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
and such but had they actually sent you
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
any bills saying pay for these services
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
no but great question um
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
if you don't contract with them you're
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
not charged these fees however
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
they increase the prices
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
again i use the backyard
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
brewery as an example they have
 
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.549 align:start position:0%
brewery as an example they have
contractually

00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
contractually
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
agreed with them to pay these fees if
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
you don't so i went on tgi friday's
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
website did the same thing
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
their sixteen dollar cheeseburger came
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
to a fourteen dollars cheeseburger came
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
to twenty two dollars
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
so they charged the administrative fee
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
that the delivery fee the tip and the
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
which is passed on completely to the
 
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.270 align:start position:0%
which is passed on completely to the
customer

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
customer
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
so the customer thinks that tgi fridays
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
is charging 22 dollars they're not
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
it's doordash that's charging that
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
so it's complete it's it's it's so
 
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.750 align:start position:0%
so it's complete it's it's it's so
deceptive

00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
well said okay uh representative
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
abramson's next
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
question um same as before is it the the
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
source of the problem that the food
 
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
delivery platform
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
is is advertising uh your company and
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
using your brand name um i'm looking at
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
the bill and it says a food delivery
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
platform shall not arrange for the
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
delivery of an order from a food service
 
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.950 align:start position:0%
delivery of an order from a food service
establishment

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.390 align:start position:0%
establishment
um

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
is your your concern with the fact that
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
they're advertising and using your brand
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
name correct
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
without my permission
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative meckler uh
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh mr boucher
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
brewery and on your uh
 
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.430 align:start position:0%
brewery and on your uh
friday's

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
friday's
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
delivery in other words do you know how
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
much if you follow through that that the
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
brewery or uh thank goddess friday
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
actually got for their 14 and 16
 
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.430 align:start position:0%
actually got for their 14 and 16
hamburger

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
hamburger
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
well they got they got
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
exactly what they would normally charge
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
i did not actually order it i just went
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
to the final phase of checkout they did
 
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.750 align:start position:0%
to the final phase of checkout they did
not

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
they they would get exactly what they
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
would normally charge in the restaurant
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
so they would get you know backyard
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
brewery would get their 16
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
not the 29 that i would have been
 
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.430 align:start position:0%
not the 29 that i would have been
charged

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.549 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh this could be
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
for either tom or matt
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
oh in section three
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
it says uh
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
the violation should be fined a hundred
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
dollars for each delivery
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
do you think that
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
amount of uh fine is sufficient
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
i think there just should be a law
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
stating you can't engage in third-party
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
delivery without their permission that's
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the bottom line to
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
this if restaurants want to engage with
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
these companies and be charged 25 to 30
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
god bless them they're losing money
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
every single day of the week
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
and i wish i i so wish some of these
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
restaurant tours would just do the math
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
you're not you're losing money every
 
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
single time if you're contracted with
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
these third-party deliveries you are
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
losing money they are not the life saver
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
that the media puts out there saying
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
restaurants are surviving on takeout and
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
delivery absolutely not it's it's we are
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
not surviving on that casual dining
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
pizza places sure that's their that's
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
their bread and butter that's what
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
they've been doing for
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
decades right but a casual dining
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
restaurant like copper door
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
uh representative wilhelm did you want
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
to also respond
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you chairman i i just wanted
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
to say you know if if the committee
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately thinks that you know taking
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
out this
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
100 enforcement amending the bill uh
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
so that it it takes out that
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
language that's that works for me that's
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
totally fine i think tom is right i
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
think the
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
class action lawsuit is what ultimately
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
would bring
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh these third-party delivery services
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
to justice so uh you know having having
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
a specific dollar amount may not be you
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
know the teeth that we we actually
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh think that it might need it it might
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
be better to just strip it i think
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
that's what california didn't in there
 
00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:40.630 align:start position:0%
that's what california didn't in there
bill

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
just be careful
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative yeah follow up
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh matt
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
what my question was more in the line of
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
is a hundred dollars not enough of a
 
00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:56.390 align:start position:0%
is a hundred dollars not enough of a
fine

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
not too much but not enough i mean five
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know the hundred dollars is a
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
pittance to these companies 500 bucks a
 
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.789 align:start position:0%
pittance to these companies 500 bucks a
shot

00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
shot
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
you say they do say they do 10 a day
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
it's 5 000 a day that might actually uh
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
you know flick their ear
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh i thank the representative for his
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
question and i uh invite the committee
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
to do what you will with this uh piece
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
of legislation if you feel like it needs
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
a you know a larger penalty i think
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's fine i also think you can take it
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
out again and and that class action
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
lawsuit will ultimately be the the
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
pressure that these third-party delivery
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
services need to do the right thing
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh so i'll now invite uh
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
miss horton to testify
 
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.510 align:start position:0%
miss horton to testify
good

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you um so i'm alex
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
horton i own cafe loren it's a small
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
coffee shop in downtown manchester so if
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
i could just offer some insight into
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
what happens when you get one of these
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
deliveries that you didn't sign up for
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
so we were contracted with
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
we're contracted with a delivery service
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
through square the online
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
point of sale system that we use
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
and they actually have really good
 
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.470 align:start position:0%
and they actually have really good
delivery

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
fee prices it's like a dollar fifty in
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
order fine that's what we use
 
00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:18.630 align:start position:0%
order fine that's what we use
um

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.830 align:start position:0%
um
we

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
keep being listed on the grubhub website
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
we're not contracted with grubhub
 
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.190 align:start position:0%
we're not contracted with grubhub
but

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
people think we are so what happens is
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
someone a customer will go on
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
place an order on grubhub
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
and then as tom said a grubhub delivery
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
driver will show up at the cafe now
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
to work with one of these delivery
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
services you actually need a tablet from
 
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.310 align:start position:0%
services you actually need a tablet from
them

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
or a sign in online like they'll give
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
you an account
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
with your sign in to see your orders
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
coming in so we have no way of
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
seeing and capturing those orders
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
so someone might place an order online
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
it goes through grubhub grubhub shows up
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have the food ready obviously
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
because we can't see the order we have
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
no indication that there's an order that
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
has been placed
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
we can't refund the customer grubhub
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
refuses to refund the customer and
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
essentially it's it's like what do you
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
do in that situation as a small business
 
00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:21.110 align:start position:0%
do in that situation as a small business
because

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
like tom said you're going to get a bad
 
00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:24.549 align:start position:0%
like tom said you're going to get a bad
review

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
because the customer never got their
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
food we do our best to call them and
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
explain the situation and tell them you
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
know you have to go through grubhub to
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
try to get your money back but grubhub
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
usually won't give you your money back
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
so essentially they're stealing money
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
from us they're stealing money from our
 
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.950 align:start position:0%
from us they're stealing money from our
customers

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
customers
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
and if you choose to contract with them
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
it is true they make you sign a document
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
that says we're going to take 30 percent
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
of every order which is more than the
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
fees that they take they're cutting into
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
your profit and it's just not worth it
 
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.430 align:start position:0%
your profit and it's just not worth it
so

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
if anyone has anything
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
under them yeah they contract if you do
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
sign a contract you're going to sign a
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
contract you don't want it sounds like
 
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.549 align:start position:0%
contract you don't want it sounds like
right

00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
with ambulances
 
00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:09.350 align:start position:0%
with ambulances
so

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
so the question i have is uh because i
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh we read an article in union leader in
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
and kingston pizza i guess it was and it
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
turned out to be fraud and that so when
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
they show up when when uber shows up to
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
or wherever grubhub shows up
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
they're using their credit card to pay
 
00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.669 align:start position:0%
they're using their credit card to pay
for

00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:28.710 align:start position:0%
for
your

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
no no one um no one pays us
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
in other words so when they show up and
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
want to pick up an order
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
they just say that there's an online
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
order that's been placed
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
and you can say well too bad we don't
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
know anything about it don't worry
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
exactly because we can't see it there's
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
no way for us to know if they're a real
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
grub hug driver if they're oh right it
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
could be fragile right
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
well because well if if you don't have
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
the pad you don't have the order right
 
00:27:56.399 --> 00:27:57.510 align:start position:0%
the pad you don't have the order right
um

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
then but so i guess what happened in the
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
kingston was that they would turn around
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
and place the order
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
with a fraudulent credit card and that's
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
how those people got defrauded so i was
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
just wondering whether whether grubhub
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
or or these companies whether they're
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
paying you because i i never crossed my
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
mind that you actually would give them
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
the food without any money being
 
00:28:19.039 --> 00:28:20.389 align:start position:0%
the food without any money being
exchanged

00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
exchanged
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
right but some places do because they
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
don't want the bad review they think oh
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
we must have had a grubhub order or we
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
must have had a doordash order and to
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
kind of make things right with the
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
customer they might send out
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
food in which case you lose money on
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
that entire order
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative bartlett has a
 
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.110 align:start position:0%

rhetorical

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
rhetorical
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
question than a true question but it
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
just seems to me that this is a poor
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
business model for grubhub as well it
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
sounds as though they are taking a shot
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh in the public's eye as well as
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
probably a financial shot do you agree
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.070 align:start position:0%
with that
statement

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
i do but i think that they're big enough
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
that they don't care they're i mean
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're country-wide they don't
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter to them if one small
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
cafe in manchester new hampshire
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
is having an issue with them
 
00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:00.630 align:start position:0%

representative hamm has a question
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
yes um i'm i'm just curious um
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
whether there's two ways um that these
 
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.909 align:start position:0%
whether there's two ways um that these
delivery

00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh companies um
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
work i've i've certainly been present
 
00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:19.510 align:start position:0%
work i've i've certainly been present
and

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
and part of the group that ordered um
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
go on the restaurant's website and you
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
pick out what you want and
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
and and the restaurant adds on the tax
 
00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:30.710 align:start position:0%
and and the restaurant adds on the tax
and

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
and you add on a tip if you want
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
and then there's a delivery fee and you
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
get your food
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
now are there two ways that that these
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
delivery companies do business um
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know and this
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
observing this was in a larger a larger
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
area than you know the small towns in
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but but
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
isn't that one way you can use these
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
delivery services to enhance your
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understand the question
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
so are are you asking if i could
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
if i could delete it let me let me jump
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
in so represent him there's nothing
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
stopping any restaurant to have a known
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
food delivery system and you know
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
theoretically that's a good thing to do
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
but you know that takes resources and
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
and let's face it you know customers um
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
are lazy and
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
if they had a good experience with reits
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
or somebody in the past they've got that
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
app already on their phone so they're
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
gonna have to just go there first uh
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
rather than see gee i wonder whether
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
that restaurant actually has its own
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
delivery system or not and that's really
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
what the problem is is that people are
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's good marketing there and for
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
grubhub and everybody knows who they are
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
and so they have the app on their phone
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
so they're more apt to just default to
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
that without realizing that
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
the restaurant does not have an
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
arrangement nor does they want to have
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
an arrangement because they lose too
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
much to do to provide that service so so
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a quandary
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
i think that does that answer your
 
00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:07.110 align:start position:0%
i think that does that answer your
question

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
um yes but i you know i i was on the i
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
was under the impression some of these
 
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.750 align:start position:0%
was under the impression some of these
deliveries

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
deliveries
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
we got were
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
via a you know like um
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
uber or
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
or some other
 
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
some other delivery they they were not
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
employees of of the restaurant they were
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
a contracted
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh service exactly and that's what this
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislation is requiring
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
you're saying that that that if if uh if
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
grubhub wants to you know put that
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
restaurant on their web page they need
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
to have a contractual arrangement
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
and it's up to the two parties to figure
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
out how to make that work do i have that
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
right tom you got it
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
spot on
 
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.630 align:start position:0%
spot on
okay

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%

testimony last night so
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty much gonna read most of it
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
not all of it
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
but this is a bill to require food
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
service establishments to adopt food
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
allergy awareness procedures
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is identical to hb 1102 which
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
passed this committee last year and
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
passed the house
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
it was stalled in the senate due to
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
delays brought on by covid
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
the requirement for restaurants to have
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
a certified food safety manager on site
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
already became effective this past
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
january first as part of the new
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire food code
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
food safety training includes food
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
allergy awareness
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
however this rule only applies to new
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire restaurants licensed by the
 
00:35:19.359 --> 00:35:20.390 align:start position:0%
hampshire restaurants licensed by the
state

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
15 municipalities fall outside the state
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction but h.b 65 would extend
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
certification requirements to them as
 
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.150 align:start position:0%
certification requirements to them as
well

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
these municipalities are bedford berlin
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
claremont concord dairy dover exeter
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
keene manchester merrimack nashua
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
plaistow portsmouth rochester and salem
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
boot establishments exempt via
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire dhsh rules would
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
remain would remain exempt
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
and there's there's a whole list of
 
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.710 align:start position:0%
and there's there's a whole list of
exemptions

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
but some background i want to go over to
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
consider is this bill was inspired by
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
the death in 2019 of rachel hunger a 21
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
year old unh student who unknowingly
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
ingested an allergen at a new hampshire
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant the restaurant was unaware of
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
her allergy with this bill patrons would
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
be alerted to notify their food servers
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
of any food allergies and restaurant
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
workers would have the training to
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
respond appropriately
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
rachel was one of an estimated 32
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
million people affected by food
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
allergies in the u.s alone
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
and this is up to one in every 13
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
children and one in every 13 adults
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
the cost of food allergies is estimated
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
to be 24.8 billion dollars annually in
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
the us
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
six states already have passed
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
restaurant legislation and it it runs
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
the gamut
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
this bill is probably on the low end of
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
the regulatory responsibilities
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
but illinois maryland massachusetts
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
michigan rhode island virginia and a
 
00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.190 align:start position:0%
michigan rhode island virginia and a
couple

00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
couple
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
metropolitan areas have food
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
allergy awareness
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
i'm linking in my
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
written testimony i linked to a question
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
and answer sheet that dhhs put out to
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
answer questions about their regulation
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is a sensible approach to
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
address the growth and danger of food
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
allergens while balancing the interests
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
of restaurants
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
so i ask all of you to please recommend
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
and ought to pass
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
for this bill thank you and i'll be
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh i'm sorry i didn't have a
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
chance to read the bill i'm just reading
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
now did you you said that that the uh
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
the patron is required to notify the
 
00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.990 align:start position:0%
the patron is required to notify the
establishment

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes though um this bill includes a
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
requirement that
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
wording beyond menu and menu boards that
 
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
if you have a food allergy to notify
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
your server
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
that when
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
hb 1102 was first conceived
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
i met with mike summers from the new
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire restaurant lodging association
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
and this bill is a result of a
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
discussion with him to help cover
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
restaurants liability and
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
so that they have to be aware i mean the
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
the training doesn't matter if they
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
aren't aware of the allergy
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
right right
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
so but it implied that the the patron
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
has to notify
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
yes but i i didn't actually see that in
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
the statute all i see is that uh it
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
requires the establishment to have a
 
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.349 align:start position:0%
requires the establishment to have a
sign

00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
sign
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
which assumes the consumer the patron is
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
seeing that sign
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
but uh that that they're supposed to
 
00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:44.390 align:start position:0%
but uh that that they're supposed to
notify

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
notify
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it's similar to the regulation we
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
have now that on menus it states if
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
you're having um undercooked meat or
 
00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.150 align:start position:0%
you're having um undercooked meat or
seafood

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
seafood
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
you know there's some language on menus
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
i i was around i was around for writing
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
that sentence
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
and uh that was just a mandate that they
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
had to put that on the menus yes
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay but there was no
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
there was no mandate that the patron had
 
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.430 align:start position:0%
there was no mandate that the patron had
to

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh notify
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
the uh you know you know they're just
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be aware of it and but that
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
there was no but so okay
 
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.390 align:start position:0%
there was no but so okay
i

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
belabored this enough okay so we do have
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
lots of questions and so uh
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs is first
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking um my
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
question representative wrong um
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is i i was trying to
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
figure out how big these restaurants
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
would be who are regulated under rsa 143
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
and so my question is is it i assume
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
some of these establishments may be
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
really small so my concern is is it
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
practical for them to have
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
the food protection manager there at all
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
hours if it's a small establishment and
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you could speak to
 
00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.270 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you could speak to
that

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
well the food allergy risk is going to
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
happen depending on what food they serve
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
but this is really mirroring what's in
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire food code for
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
restaurants that are licensed by the
 
00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.750 align:start position:0%
restaurants that are licensed by the
state

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
so they don't make an exception for
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants depending on their size
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to mirror what they have
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
so it applies to all new hampshire
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants not just those that are
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
licensed by the state
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
i think when patrons go to a restaurant
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
saying oh well this restaurant's
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
licensed by the state and this one isn't
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
i think this provides some consistency
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
in what the rules
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
already are on the books
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
further question me inquire yeah so
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
again in um you know this this seems
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
like very reasonable to me so i just
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
want to make that clear but my question
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
is let's just say there's a small
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
sandwich shop in concord and um
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's open after seven where they don't
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
get as much business um the manager is
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
not there after this after seven o'clock
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
is it practical to ask this small shop
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
to have this food protection manager
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
there at those hours
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
well i believe it is so because anybody
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
coming in and i think if you speak to
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
some of the people who suffer from food
 
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.510 align:start position:0%
some of the people who suffer from food
allergies

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
allergies
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know it's
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
i think that they this this law would
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's some protection and
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
some awareness of the risk that they may
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
have consuming food there
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
so i i don't think it's unreasonable for
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
a restaurant to have this type of
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
training among their workers and at
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
least one of them would have to have it
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
for each shift
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so but uh would you clarify who
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
who's licensed by the state and who's
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
not and because you mentioned all those
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
cities so
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
those cities have their own regulatory
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
authority and so therefore do not
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
require the state license
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes well they have to license on their
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
own but they don't have to
 
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.790 align:start position:0%
own but they don't have to
mirror

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
mirror
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire food code most of them
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
do and they eventually will but
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
an established
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
in statute that they have to follow the
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire food code but typically
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
when a city updates their
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
their own local food code they mirror
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
what's in the state code and then the
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
state also mirrors what's in the federal
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
food code that's how this came to be it
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
came in through the u.s food code but if
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
i in my little podunka town range
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
which we don't have that regulation um
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
is every restaurant required to get the
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
state license
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes yeah they they've been in range
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
they've been required since january
 
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
they've been required since january
first

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
january first it just wanted the fact
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
that they were required to have have
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
this person on duty okay but i'm in
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
merrimack and there may be restaurants
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
in merrimack that have that don't have
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
to comply with the january
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
city the big city that decided that they
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
were going to handle the licensure
 
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.710 align:start position:0%
were going to handle the licensure
themselves

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay representative bartlett
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
you muted and um thank you very much um
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay so i was pulling last year's bill
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
on this representative wrong and um i my
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
one of my questions is
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
we amended it does this
 
00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.430 align:start position:0%
we amended it does this
bill

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
include the amendment
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
um which was
 
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.230 align:start position:0%
um which was
0437

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
0437
 
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.190 align:start position:0%
0437
yes

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
okay the bill in front of you is exactly
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
the bill that passed the house the
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that was made in committee was
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
to remove in fact actually i think the
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
i think i brought that amendment through
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
um it was after discussions with the
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
food protection
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
director of dhhs
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
part of that bill included a voluntary
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
program where restaurants could qualify
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
considered allergy friendly but the
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
dhhs did not feel they had the resources
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
to manage that voluntary program so we
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
just took it out
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
and then there was an amendment made on
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house to rename it
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
rachel's law
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
but both of those amendments um are
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
captured in h.b 65. that's right um i've
 
00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.630 align:start position:0%
captured in h.b 65. that's right um i've
got

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
the the amendment that passed i have
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
your other amendment i had an x through
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
it i thought i wasn't sure which was
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
first um
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
and it did come out of our committee
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
sixteen to four auto password amendment
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the work you've done on
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
this i know there are a lot of other
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
folks that want to want to speak to this
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
and we have a great deal of written
 
00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.630 align:start position:0%
and we have a great deal of written
testimony

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
um and many of the restaurants are are
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
very much in favor of this so thanks for
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward again
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay yeah representative mcaleer
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair um
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative wrong i i looking at this
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
there seems to be
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh a number of
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
exceptions and that sort of bothers me
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
like roman numerals free uh does not
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
apply to any food services
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
establishment exempt from licensure and
 
00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:09.829 align:start position:0%
establishment exempt from licensure and
then

00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
under four number three exemption for
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
food service it seems like there's an
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
awful lot of exemptions here how any
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
idea how many restaurants are not
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know not under the state or under
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
the under the uh
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
and and couldn't this be amended to
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
cover those as well
 
00:45:27.839 --> 00:45:29.589 align:start position:0%
cover those as well
well

00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know the number to be honest
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
with you the number of restaurants and
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
um i'm sure the food protection
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
director from the state would know that
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
um my goal with this is is twofold one
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
is to bring awareness of food allergies
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
not just of the the restaurant but also
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
of the patrons that they know that they
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to notify their
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
server because so that the restaurant
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
can be uh can respond appropriately make
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
sure they're not being served something
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to yield a reaction and
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
make that person sick
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
as far as the exemptions go i just
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to mirror
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
what's in the state rules already
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
and not to have a laborious bill that
 
00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
and not to have a laborious bill that
would

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
um where some restaurants would be uh in
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
compliance with the the bill but not be
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the state and vice
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
versa so i was really looking
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
prioritizing consistency
 
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.430 align:start position:0%
prioritizing consistency
between

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
this bill and then how it's how it would
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
be enforced at the state
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
i don't that answers your question or
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
not but yeah it does thank you thank you
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative weston
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative rung for bringing us this
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
legislation i'm wondering if you could
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
give us an idea of how onerous the
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
training is uh who gives it what it
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
costs and how long it takes
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
yeah um i actually printed it out there
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
are um
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
the training can vary i know that i
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
think with the new hampshire restaurant
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
lodging association they've done it in
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
bulk like you can buy like 16
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
programs and and there's a discount for
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
it um right now there's there's six
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
organizations that offer it um in fact
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
from the state's q a it says in order to
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
obtain certification of a food
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
protection manager a person must pass a
 
00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.030 align:start position:0%
protection manager a person must pass a
food

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
safety certification examination
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
and be issued a certificate from the
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
following accredited certification
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
organizations or by a program developed
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
by one of these organizations recognized
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
by the conference for food protection so
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's six organizations that
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
offer this i went online and just did a
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
cursory search of most of them and um it
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
ranges from the exam as being 35 because
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
you don't have to take the test
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
but you can just take the test if you
 
00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
pass that you get certification but the
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
the content's difficult they do
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
recommend you take the course
 
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
and most courses now i don't i couldn't
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
find any um
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
programs that are offered in classroom
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
those are the most expensive ones and
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
they're about 179 dollars a person but
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
most of them range anywhere from 50 to
 
00:48:11.839 --> 00:48:12.710 align:start position:0%
most of them range anywhere from 50 to
um

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
you know 150 dollars
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
and like i said some restaurant
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
associations or large restaurant chains
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
will offer it as a group they'll get a
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
group discount
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
and then it's a oh and then to answer
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
your question if it wasn't in line uh in
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:36.690 align:start position:0%
okay representative greason
 
00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:38.069 align:start position:0%
okay representative greason
[Music]

00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
now good morning uh representative and
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh taking our questions
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
this morning um
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
one potential issue that i can see here
 
00:48:47.359 --> 00:48:48.390 align:start position:0%
one potential issue that i can see here
is

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.349 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
which allergies is this manager
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
going to have to be prepared or these
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
managers going to be have to be prepared
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
to deal with and what happens if someone
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
has an allergy for which no one is
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
properly trained i mean it seems to me
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
like the peanut allergy uh if i
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
understand that this rachel uh
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
was allergic to peanuts and that may be
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
very common but what if there's
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
something else that just how do you
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
prepare for all the possible allergies
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
well we're not we're really this bill
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
just focuses in the training the
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
certification focuses i believe it's
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
like eight or nine major allergy groups
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
i knew them all last year it's like
 
00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.309 align:start position:0%
i knew them all last year it's like
wheat

00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
wheat
 
00:49:28.319 --> 00:49:29.349 align:start position:0%
wheat
milk

00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
milk
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
or dairy seafood nuts tree nuts hello
 
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.230 align:start position:0%
or dairy seafood nuts tree nuts hello
um

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
no it would only cover the major
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
allergens but those are actually um
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
most over 95 of food allergies fall into
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
those groups
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
someone having someone having a less
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
common allergy they would have to assume
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
the responsibility um solely for what
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
they would be ordering
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it's is it the
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
idea is that the restaurant knows what
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
are the ingredients of whatever they're
 
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.150 align:start position:0%
are the ingredients of whatever they're
serving

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
serving
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
so if the person mentions that
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
ingredient then then there's a problem
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative wrong for taking my
 
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.670 align:start position:0%
representative wrong for taking my
question

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
um i've been in the food business and my
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
family has for many many years and i'm
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
safe serve and
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
the cities that are licensed by the
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
towns and
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
um the ones that are just licensed by
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
the state but um if
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
if um a restaurant um can promote that
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
they've had this training and an
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
individual comes in
 
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.109 align:start position:0%
individual comes in
um

00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
they can't can they
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
feel safe
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
eating there if they have you know
 
00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.990 align:start position:0%
eating there if they have you know
allergies

00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
allergies
 
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:58.790 align:start position:0%
allergies
to

00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know nuts um
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
for instance there might be
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
you know there might be sourced foods um
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
from another venue that does have nuts
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
in it but it's not identified that
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
there's nuts in it so what kind of a
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
recourse does the restaurant have or the
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
patron have if
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
there's an issue
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
and they've been they have the
 
00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.549 align:start position:0%
and they've been they have the
certification

00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:25.430 align:start position:0%
certification
um

00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if i'm understanding your
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
question um but let me try to restate it
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
and let me and let me know if i've got
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
it so let's say if a restaurant is using
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
a product and they're not aware if it
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
contains an allergy but then they go on
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
and serve that to someone under right
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.030 align:start position:0%
oh okay
um

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding from federal law is
 
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.270 align:start position:0%
my understanding from federal law is
that

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
food coming in has to be labeled as
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
containing an allergy an allergen so the
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant would be aware of it because
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
if they're bringing it into their
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
restaurant it's got to be labeled that
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
it contains
 
00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:57.990 align:start position:0%
it contains
um

00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know an allergen
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
so for instance i'll give you an example
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
let's say um a restaurant is buying a
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
thickener or gravy
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
it would have to say that it contains
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
soy or or wheat
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
as they get it in
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the training would alert them also
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
what things have an allergy an allergen
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
in it and what doesn't
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
because there's soy and a lot of food um
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
you know we think it's only in soy sauce
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
but it may be in other food but the
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
training alerts them to what type of
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
food has that allergy in it
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
and just a just a follow-up
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um if an individual has
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
such serious you know allergies um isn't
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
it fire beware like just don't go out to
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
eat because there could be at any point
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
in time
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know so if someone does get
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh deathly ill
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
and the restaurant has gone through this
 
00:52:58.319 --> 00:52:59.750 align:start position:0%
and the restaurant has gone through this
training

00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
what happens then are there lawsuits
 
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.589 align:start position:0%
what happens then are there lawsuits
what's

00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's not this bill doesn't
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
that doesn't um
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
forbid them it's not in a legislation
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
that would assign liability
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
but it's really to reduce the risk i
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
mean most allergens
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
allergic reaction um people get really
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
sick for about a week or two um the the
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
the cases where someone dies from an ana
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
from anaphylaxis
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
is very uncommon i think it's only like
 
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.470 align:start position:0%
is very uncommon i think it's only like
150

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
150
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe up to 300 cases a year in
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
the us
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
but it's to reduce the incidence and
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's so prevalent i mean um it's like
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
one ever one out of let me see 32
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
million people in the u.s suffer for it
 
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.589 align:start position:0%
million people in the u.s suffer for it
so

00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
when you add up all those dollars of
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
lost productivity and people not being
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
able to work because they've been sick
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
this is really to reduce the risk of
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
sickness from an allergic reaction
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
no having no more questions i'll invite
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
john dunn to testify
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you everyone
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%

association uh mike summers was tied up
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
in another hearing so i'm here to
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
represent the
 
00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.150 align:start position:0%
represent the
industry

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
i'm also the
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
director of operations for the michael
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
timothy's dining group and i'm also a
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
certified serv-safe uh instructor
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
just give you a little bit of background
 
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
of where i'm coming from
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
a couple concerns that the industry has
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
regarding the the build it it seems to
 
00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
be a little duplicitive in the fact that
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
like you said the state is already
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
requiring the cert the food protection
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
manager certification
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh i would
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
like to know how many of the
 
00:55:00.319 --> 00:55:01.190 align:start position:0%
like to know how many of the
self

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
self
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
governing towns
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
don't require because a lot of them are
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
more have always been more restrictive
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
than the state
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
i know portsmouth nashua merrimack all
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
require uh the certification
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
for someone on the staff to be certified
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's typically the serv safe
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
certification that most people get uh
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
which does cover the allergens
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
so that that's definitely a concern
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
where there might be some crossover some
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
changes to the state law may not
 
00:55:29.839 --> 00:55:30.790 align:start position:0%
changes to the state law may not
impact

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know crossover with the law here
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
just concerned about some
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
some crossover
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
issues there
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
the biggest concern we have though is
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
well actually the biggest concern we
 
00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:45.549 align:start position:0%
well actually the biggest concern we
have

00:55:45.549 --> 00:55:45.559 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
getting someone sick
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
in the restaurant industry it's it's the
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
biggest fear that any restaurant
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
operator has
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
is that someone has an allergen and
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
you know something got missed along the
 
00:55:58.559 --> 00:55:59.510 align:start position:0%
you know something got missed along the
way

00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
and someone you know has an allergic
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
reaction to food that we serve them it's
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's definitely a fear for anyone that's
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
in the restaurant business it's
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
something we we all take very seriously
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh and obviously you know
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
the impetus for this whole case is a
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
very tragic case
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
that no one ever wants to experience so
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's something that
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
the good operators
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
are very concerned about uh
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
the other concern in the bill that we're
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
worried about is the
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
the word all uh including this message
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
on all menus there are so many
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
menus that go out in a restaurant and
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know just missing that this warning
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
label on one of the menus could cause
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
some some problems for the the
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant operators uh you know you've
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
got a
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
your main menu you've got a dinner menu
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
a cocktail menu a wine menu you might
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
have some specials you might have a
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
pop-up menu that comes up you know
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
remembering to add that onto each menu
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
can be owners to the operation uh
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
so there's definitely concern there and
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
there's also you know the concern that
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
it says uh you must inform your server
 
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh with the way things are changed now
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
that there's many different ways that
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
people get their orders into restaurants
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
there's digital menus
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
there are um
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
you went to the fast food restaurants
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
you could be ordering from a kiosk you
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
can't communicate that to your your your
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
server as it be
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
um and also with the third party the
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
hearing just before i was talking about
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
grubhub doordash they have menus online
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
are we responsible for making sure that
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
they're posting this on on their sites
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
now so i think there's there's
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
definitely some concerns in there uh
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
of some
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
areas that where
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
restaurants can end up with more
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
liability due to this legislation uh you
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
know it's being you know
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
the conversation last year with mike
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
summers was making sure that it was it's
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
upon the consumer
 
00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.230 align:start position:0%
upon the consumer
to

00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
notify the restaurant that they have an
 
00:57:57.839 --> 00:58:00.150 align:start position:0%
notify the restaurant that they have an
allergen

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
allergen
 
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.109 align:start position:0%
allergen
so

00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions on any of
 
00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:03.910 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions on any of
this

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
these statements but
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
those are the concerns from from the
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
industry if you could help address some
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
of those areas in this legislation would
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.349 align:start position:0%
restaurants already um use servsafe and
and

00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't serve safe i've i've
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
taken the servsafe
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh certification
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh before don't they have a whole
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
section on uh allergens
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
food allergens
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes they do they covered uh some mention
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
of the big eight peanuts tree nuts milk
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
eggs fish shellfish soy and wheat are
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
the big eight they're
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
encompassed of the allergens but i can
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
tell you from working in the business
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
there's there's thousands of other ones
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
out there uh you know cinnamon garlic i
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
had a lady once it's uh had an allergy
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
to perfume so no one else in the room
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
could have perfume it's like how do i
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
accommodate this guest
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
you know we ended up having them come in
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
early and we had them in a separate area
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
and able to accommodate that guest uh
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
but yes it is part of the surfsafe
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
training uh
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's it is just getting rolled
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
out and with covid there's a lot of been
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
challenges with getting people certified
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
so i think there's been a little bit of
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
grace period on getting people certified
 
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
um obviously there is an expense to it
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh the servsafe
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
just the exam alone is fifty dollars per
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
per employee
 
00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.870 align:start position:0%
per employee
uh

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know if you and if you just go take
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
if you think you can just go take the
 
00:59:38.319 --> 00:59:40.309 align:start position:0%
if you think you can just go take the
test

00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
it's not very likely they're gonna pass
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
the test it is a very encompassing uh
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
exam it's not just something you can
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
just walk in and just oh i've been
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
working the business for a long time and
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
i can take this and pass it
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's not that simple
 
00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.670 align:start position:0%
uh it's not that simple
follow-up

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
um so do you think that this uh this
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
bill would it would expand the uh
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
allergen training to additional
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
restaurants in the state
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
or is is is that already being done
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's already a part of the uh the
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
serve safe uh
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
i think that's a big step right now for
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is getting restaurants um
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
with a food protection manager on
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
on-site uh
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
someone else raised the question about
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
should it be someone on site at all
 
01:00:28.559 --> 01:00:29.829 align:start position:0%
should it be someone on site at all
times

01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a tough challenge
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
especially for the small operators
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times some of these places
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
have you know young younger staff that
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
are already going to school
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
they're receiving training in-house from
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
that certified manager
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
when they're the person in charge that
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know that's part of their their
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
training is they're getting the training
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
from the food protection manager it's
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
part of the responsibility of the food
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
protection manager for the business to
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that the people in charge
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
understand and know
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
how important uh you know obviously food
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
safety and also the the allergen piece
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
of it is
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%

correct so this is not um
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
this does not change the state
 
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.710 align:start position:0%
this does not change the state
requirements

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.910 align:start position:0%
requirements
um

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
mr dunn so
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
if it mirrors the state requirements
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
and you're not likely to change the
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
state requirements
 
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.670 align:start position:0%
state requirements
what

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
why is there a problem with this bill
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
well the two concerns are
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
one being
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
you've got a separate
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
you're setting separate policy for the
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
self-governing towns so that i believe
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
there's led
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
through right now for the state
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh food code
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
where it's not gonna require
 
01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.349 align:start position:0%
where it's not gonna require
a

01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
to be on site at all times it's that
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
there's a food protection manager
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
conflict between the the two where this
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
would be more restrictive than the
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
estate one would be should that
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill pass
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
other concern is including it on all
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
menus as i said there's there's numerous
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
is ordered uh
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
trying to cover all menus or it could be
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
a statement listed
 
01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:51.510 align:start position:0%
a statement listed
or

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
at the entrance to the facility
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
the signage
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
the door you know no shirt
 
01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:02.710 align:start position:0%
the door you know no shirt
analogy

01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you right so i guess john
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
just sort of what she's asking is is
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
these two issues that you're bringing up
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
the all on all menus and full-time
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
person on duty is that not in the state
 
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.589 align:start position:0%
person on duty is that not in the state
statute

01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
well the allergen is not in the state
 
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:26.390 align:start position:0%
well the allergen is not in the state
step

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
i really missed that one the allergen
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
this food allergy where is not in the
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
state statute just the
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
the maybe we'll hear from dhhs yeah okay
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
so what i'm going to ask you john is you
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
know if you want to just i would turn
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
everything off reboot you know hopefully
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
maybe that'll solve the problem and then
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
i'll invite someone else up to speak so
 
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
person i have
 
01:05:51.839 --> 01:05:53.109 align:start position:0%
person i have
um

01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%

thank you to the committee my name is
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
heather gass i'm a resident of merrimack
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire lifelong
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire resident and i am
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
testifying today in favor of hb65
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
um please refer to my mitten written
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that i emailed to the
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
committee for additional facts and some
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
data sources and in light of the time
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
today i'm going to try to keep this to
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
under three minutes for you
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i have a severe allergy allergy to
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
tree nuts my two-year-old son also has
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
multiple life-threatening food allergies
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
so this bill is really important to my
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
family and i because of a near fatal
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
reaction that i experienced at a nashua
 
01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.710 align:start position:0%
reaction that i experienced at a nashua
restaurant

01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
i ordered a meal that i had eaten at
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
least a dozen times before at the same
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
restaurant and this time it contained my
 
01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:03.430 align:start position:0%
restaurant and this time it contained my
allergen

01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
allergen
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
i soon went into anaphylaxis and we
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
found out that the kitchen had made a
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
substitution that was not um anywhere
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
that we knew about and
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
the dish now had contained my allergen
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
my throat started to close um i
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
struggled to breathe
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
my fingers turned blue my lips turned
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
blue and my oxygen levels were quickly
 
01:07:23.359 --> 01:07:24.390 align:start position:0%
blue and my oxygen levels were quickly
dropping

01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
dropping
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
um i was rushed to the er where they
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
gave me epinephrine and steroids
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
and thankfully i recovered but i tell
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
you this anecdote because i want to be
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
i almost lost my life because of what i
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
was served at this restaurant
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
and this isn't just a small problem and
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
i think there's many shades of gray in
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
between here between experiencing
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
anaphylaxis and just having an itchy
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
mouth or a key throat i just want the
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
committee to understand that there are
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
very varying degrees of allergic
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
reactions that can happen
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
um and so according to research
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
conducted by mckinsey and company last
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
year more than 32 million americans do
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
suffer from life-threatening food
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
allergies for new hampshire that means
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
that's more than 131 000 of us
 
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
just like my son and i
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
um supporting this bill doesn't only
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
make sense from a health standpoint but
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
from an economic one research conducted
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
by the national restaurant association
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
in 2012 found that during normal times
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
restaurants lose approximately 45
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars per week and potential
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
sales to food allergy families who don't
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
feel safe dining out at places that
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
don't accommodate them
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
this means that critical revenue goes
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
elsewhere like to neighboring
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
massachusetts where there's already a
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
law that's very similar to hb65
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
those dollars could have potentially
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
been spent here in new hampshire if we
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
had a better policy of informing
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
customers about potential allergens and
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that staff are trained on
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
how to keep customers safe
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
now new hampshire does have a small
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
number of allergy friendly
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
establishments such as 110 grill
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
sub-zero ice cream and burton's grill
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
who have all implemented training and
 
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
safety protocols to accommodate
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
customers with food allergies
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
and these establishments benefit from
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
their allergy pilots policies and
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
training by preventing harm to their
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
clientele and gaining the loyal
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
patronage of families like mine in the
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
food allergy community
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
so with other states like our neighbors
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts and rhode island and i
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
think there's about four others that
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
have already enacted similar laws there
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
are already ample resources that are
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
available for implementing the
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
requirements of this bill
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you again for hearing my testimony
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
today i will hope that you will
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
expeditiously expeditiously recommend
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
and not to pass on hb65 to help keep
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
families like mine safe when dining out
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and i'm happy to answer
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committees
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
ms gas a quick question
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
is there a sort of a universal antidote
 
01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.229 align:start position:0%
is there a sort of a universal antidote
for

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
these type of
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
reactions at all
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
and is that something that you would
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
carry with yourself or a restaurant
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
might have that's a great question so
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
currently in the state of new hampshire
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
law requiring that restaurants have to
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
stock epinephrine which is the go-to
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
medication for an allergic reaction
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
people that have a diagnosed allergy
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
typically will have a prescription for
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
an epipen and are recommended to carry
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
that with them at all times
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that mistakes happen
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they get left at home
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know depending on the the patient
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
they have different recommendations for
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
medications to take but epinephrine is
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
the gold standard i'd also like to
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
mention that um food food allergy
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
reactions do happen to people that don't
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
have a history of an allergic reaction
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
so that's an instance where they
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have epinephrine available and
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
but they they wouldn't be able to form
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
the restaurant they have it if they
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
didn't know they had that allergy yes
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
that is a possibility yes
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
if you go to massachusetts and you go to
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
a restaurant that you have you know
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
frequented and you do have a reaction
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
what happens then
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
i mean how do you
 
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.149 align:start position:0%
i mean how do you
yeah

01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
sorry that is a great question i think
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
i'll speak on my personal experience
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
when i go to a place that um has that
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
training and when i when i tell them
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
about my allergy and i know that they
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
note it down they go and check with the
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
kitchen to make sure that everything's
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
still safe for me them doing those steps
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
gives me confidence that my meal is
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
going to be safe
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
and i do realize that mistakes do happen
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
and if you know as a result of something
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
like that if i did have a reaction
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
personally i would not hold that
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
restaurant responsible if they had taken
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
those steps
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
um on the other hand i've been at plenty
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
of restaurants where um i mentioned that
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
i have an allergy and um i've even been
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
served for example a salad with pecans
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
on it which could have sent me into
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
straight amphloxis even um having told
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
them about that but that's for a
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant that doesn't have some sort
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
of allergy policy in place so i think
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
just in short to answer your question i
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
feel more confident when they have those
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
policies in place and when i can see
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
that they've they're actively following
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
them when i go and make my order and i
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
see how the process is going so that i
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
can trust that my food is safe
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%

here to support this bill strongly i
 
01:12:59.669 --> 01:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
know that's terribly important
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
at one time heather gass was a
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine and it was very
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
important that we bring
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
bills like this forward to protect her
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
and her family
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%

01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
will give my time up and say thank you
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
very much for your consideration of this
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
great bill bye bye everybody

thank you very much
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay john done sorry we'll try try again
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
you're assuming you're on with your cell
 
01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.510 align:start position:0%
you're assuming you're on with your cell
phone

01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
phone
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes i am hopefully this is a better
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
connection for you
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay so do you remember where you left
 
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:37.510 align:start position:0%
okay so do you remember where you left
off

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay so i guess the question was is to
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
be sure that uh
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
the committee would want to have comfort
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
that that we're not doing anything
 
01:13:47.679 --> 01:13:48.709 align:start position:0%
that that we're not doing anything
different

01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
than what is already in the state statue
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
which i guess is called the food safe
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
statute uh rule i guess it's a rule it
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
was done by rural brother statute and
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
we're just worried that the two things
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
you brought up which was the menus and
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
the full-time personnel on duty
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
is that in the uh the food safe
 
01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.750 align:start position:0%
is that in the uh the food safe
rules

01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
it it it is in the fruit safety rules uh
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
that there is a certified food
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
protection manager on duty
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
it is not a regulation under the food
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
code to post on the menu that the
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
customer must inform you of an allergy
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay so you still have this requirement
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
that somebody has to be on duty at all
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
times who knows what to do when someone
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
says they have an allergy
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
what your concern is then would be is
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
that the menu
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
that might be the one that got put under
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
my car window at the at the supermarket
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
that supported yeah or
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
you've got a chalkboard special and you
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
write a special up on a chalkboard and
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
now you're gonna add this disclaimer at
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
the bottom of that menu as well it's
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
like when you say all menus
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
all is a very encompassing word you know
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
on the main menu on the or post signage
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
posted within the facility on a table
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
tent on a brochure uh i mean
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
warning that's out there regarding
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
consuming raw undercooked foods may
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
increase the the possibility of a
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
foodborne illness
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
that requirement doesn't say it needs to
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
be on all menus
 
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.030 align:start position:0%
be on all menus
that

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
the language on that can be posted on a
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
sign in the restaurant it can be on a
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
table tent um you know when it's on them
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
when you
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
have a menu you put an asterisk next to
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
the item that
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
such as raw oysters you would asterisk
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
it as that is an item that is you know
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
served raw
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
whereas the allergens you can't really
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
do that because every single menu item
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
could could potentially have an allergen
 
01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.070 align:start position:0%
could could potentially have an allergen
so

01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
um you know having
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know having the communication that
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
the the guest must please inform us of
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
it of any allergens uh on your main menu
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
signage within the restaurant but but
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
requiring on on every single menu that
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
you produce uh
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
opens up some doors for some liability
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
to restaurants right so if i understand
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
you correctly so for instance if you
 
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
were to take out an ad in a newspaper
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
and it happened to lift your menu
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
then you would that that small print if
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
you shrunk the menu down to fit on that
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
ad now that small print could be so
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
small that you could barely see it if at
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
all and that could be problematic
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
and so you you don't happen to know what
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
the language is in the state rule is or
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
how do they how do they say that do they
 
01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.149 align:start position:0%
how do they how do they say that do they
say

01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
i mean because i remember when we wrote
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
it about the seafood that it had to be
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
on the it had to be on the menu
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
but i don't remember if we used the word
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm i'm referring back to the food
 
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
code on that
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
yeah because the food code requires it
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
to be you know noted on on the menu if
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
you have items that are
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
served raw or undercooked
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
right that that can also be posted
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
in the facility
 
01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.149 align:start position:0%
in the facility
okay

01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative abel has a question
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead rich yes thank you um i'm not
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
sure if this is for you mr dunn or
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps or uh representative wrong
 
01:17:09.199 --> 01:17:09.990 align:start position:0%
perhaps or uh representative wrong
but

01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.030 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
i did not see any penalty
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.550 align:start position:0%
on the bill
if

01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
you if a restaurant had
 
01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:21.910 align:start position:0%
you if a restaurant had
uh

01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
a menu that didn't didn't include this
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
and i don't recall there being one from
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.189 align:start position:0%
last year
so

01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
i would think that um
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
well would it be would it be correct
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
then that
 
01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.470 align:start position:0%
then that
that

01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.390 align:start position:0%
that
uh

01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
you would be excused if you happen if if
 
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
if it happened not to be on all menus or
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
something i mean it just this seems like
 
01:17:48.719 --> 01:17:49.910 align:start position:0%
something i mean it just this seems like
a

01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
i just want to ask that question
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's more about liability
 
01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.470 align:start position:0%
it's more about liability
when

01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
a case occurs
 
01:17:58.640 --> 01:17:59.510 align:start position:0%
a case occurs
uh

01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know that the person who's who's
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
affected by it will come back and say
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
well the state law says it's supposed to
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
be on all menus you didn't put on that
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
that menu and to tell me that i should
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
have told you so it
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's more of a liability concern it's
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
not a you know i'm not concerned about
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
fines or anything of that nature it's
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
do you want to attempt to answer that
 
01:18:22.719 --> 01:18:24.830 align:start position:0%
do you want to attempt to answer that
question

01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
rosary yes thank you um in the uh state
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
rules there is a 250 dollar fine for
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
non-compliance that says it's possible
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
so it's at the direction of the
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
department but i do want to tell the
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
committee that the language regarding
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
that would be required to be on menus
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
actually was a suggestion by mike
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
summers when i met with him on this over
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
a year ago
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
he felt that restaurants needed to cover
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
their liability because they couldn't be
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
expected to protect someone from
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
allergic reaction if they didn't know
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
they had the allergy so there were so
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
when we had a meeting
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
he suggested having information on the
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
menu so that the restaurant could be
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
aware and then and then make any
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
is there uh anyone else who has a
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%

according to the journal of allergy and
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
clinical immunology anaphylaxis is a
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
life-threatening allergic reaction is
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
common in the us more than one in 13
 
01:20:14.159 --> 01:20:15.189 align:start position:0%
common in the us more than one in 13
people

01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
in america have experienced
 
01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.630 align:start position:0%
in america have experienced
anaphylactics

01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
anaphylactics
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
my daughter hope tauwani is a freshman
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
at plymouth state and she is one of
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
those one in 13 americans
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
she is allergic to tree nuts
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
cashews almonds hazelnuts
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
walnuts and bee can't pecans or just to
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
name a few
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
um you'd think it just you know if she
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
just didn't eat
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
nuts in general she'd be fine but the
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
problem is that they can be found in
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
breads pizza crusts french fries a fria
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
later on a food prep area and even food
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
prep equipment and more
 
01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:49.590 align:start position:0%
prep equipment and more
um

01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
and not only can um
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
they be found in those items but
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
they're also make could be processed in
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
a facility that did have tree nuts an
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
allergic reaction could happen so going
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
to eat at a restaurant
 
01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
is like playing russian roulette um
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's such inconsistency in knowledge
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
food safe uh food practices
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
menu items and what ingredients are in
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
each item in the restaurant industry
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
spans the gamut of having no idea to
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
truly understanding the severity of food
 
01:21:20.719 --> 01:21:21.910 align:start position:0%
truly understanding the severity of food
allergies

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
allergies
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
my daughter hope has had four instances
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
where she has told her server about the
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
allergy and
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
those three those four places have
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
served items with nuts in them hope is
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
fastidious when it comes to sharing her
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
food allergy every single time she
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
places an order
 
01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
two instances occurred at popular coffee
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
establishments uh she was served a
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
hazelnut coffee even though she asked
 
01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
for a regular coffee and because she is
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
fastidious about her allergy she read
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
the label on her cup before she drank it
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
same thing happened at another um
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
ordering coffee at a different place um
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
it was served with almond milk and again
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
she didn't drink it um she read the the
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
marking on the outside of the cup prior
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
to say taking a sip thank god um
 
01:22:11.199 --> 01:22:12.149 align:start position:0%
to say taking a sip thank god um
so

01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
it's not just about whether or not the
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
person shares their allergy which
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely that is definitely a critical
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
component to all of this but it's also
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
about the knowledge on the other end
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
when someone is actually sharing their
 
01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.510 align:start position:0%
when someone is actually sharing their
allergy

01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
allergy
 
01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.310 align:start position:0%
allergy
um

01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
and she's actually even had to inform
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
you know when she orders coffee please
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
don't use the same spoon that you use
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
when you serve coffees with um
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
with almond milk in it um because she
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
knows the person on the other end
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
receiving the order has not been trained
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
or don't doesn't quite understand
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
because they say you're ordering coffee
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
there's no nuts and coffee
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
um another restaurant she had gone to
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
she informed her server um
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
and they have a practice where the
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
manager actually delivers the food to
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
the person with the allergy um and he
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
actually brought the salad
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
from the kitchen put it in front of her
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
had a special flag on it identifying
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
that it was allergen free and it was
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
covered in pecans
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
he literally walked it from the kitchen
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
to right in front of her and didn't even
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
notice there were pecans all over it
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
and the last most scary instance
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
happened at dairy queen she knows she
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
can't typically go to a traditional ice
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
cream location because they share scoops
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
in between each ice cream container
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
um but she always felt safe going to
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
dairy queen because the ice cream comes
 
01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
out of machine and she was assured it
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
was clean so after having a few bites of
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
her ice cream even though she informed
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
the server she actually had a tree nut
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
allergy that person actually wrote it
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
down and actually gave it to the person
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
preparing it
 
01:23:42.239 --> 01:23:43.270 align:start position:0%
preparing it
um

01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
she felt like something was wrong with
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
her throat it was closing i actually
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
ended up having to give her an her
 
01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.629 align:start position:0%
ended up having to give her an her
epipen

01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
epipen
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
and it kept getting worse and so i
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
called 9-1-1 i gave her a second
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
injection of epipen
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
and drove to concord hospital
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
and i knew i could get there faster than
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
when an ambulance could arrive um and
 
01:24:08.229 --> 01:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
because i was on the phone with 9-1-1
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
they alerted the hospital that we were
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
on our way and literally when we walked
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the the lobby was filled with people
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
waiting to be uh taken in but they took
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
her first because they knew the severity
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
of anaphylactics
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
so those are just a few instances of
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
cross-contamination um and the last
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
being the worst and truly not necessary
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
if their staff were trained
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
but i can share with you also dozens of
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
times that we've actually either left a
 
01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:37.350 align:start position:0%
times that we've actually either left a
restaurant

01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
because the server was flippant and not
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about food allergies
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
hearing statements like you should be
 
01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.270 align:start position:0%
hearing statements like you should be
fine

01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
yes i don't think that has nuts in it
 
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
you should it's okay
 
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
this is life or death we can't have
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
shoulds and you you know you could be
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
fine um and so literally we just get up
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
and leave and someone had mentioned like
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
what about when you order online
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
and this is just our family we never
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
order online we always call because we
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
never know who's going to be reading the
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
order on the other end of um the
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
computer even if we identify there are
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
food allergies and this is what it is so
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
we call we talk to a human we hear the
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
voice um
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
and place our order
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
um there's such inconsistency across the
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
platform of restaurants and food allergy
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
awareness let's get these restaurants
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
informed of the severity of food
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
allergies to make it safer for all to
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
dine out i recommend
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
and opt this to pass this is life or
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
death for approximately one in thirteen
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
okay any uh questions for
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
mr tulane none thank you very much for
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%

kasinowski is the last thing yeah
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
having us here today i am speaking in
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
support of house bill 65
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
rachel's law
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
when we first introduced the version of
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
this bill in 2020
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
i was full of
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
emotion and mourning
 
01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
for our babysitter and friend rachel
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
hunger we miss her every day
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
and we will continue to spread her light
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
in any way that we possibly can
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
what i've learned
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
over the last year
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
is that the emotions that we continue to
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
feel grief anger sadness with the loss
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
of rachel will not bring her back
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
it's time for us to take a stance on
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
this real issue and that's why i sit
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
here before you all today to ask the
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
members of this committee to pass
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 65 requiring food

establishments to have allergy awareness
procedures

01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
i feel it's important to share that i do
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
not have a food allergy
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
no one in my family has a food allergy
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
growing up i cannot remember remember
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
anyone specifically suffering from a
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
food allergy
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
i can imagine that many people would
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
share in these same statements
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
and therefore may think that food
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
allergies are not a
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
big deal
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
i can absolutely admit that i was naive
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
to how big of an issue this really was
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
i could share numerous numerous facts
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
today that i found from credible online
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
sources with you regarding food
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
allergies the number of people it
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
affects how many trips the emergency
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
room each day each minute are due to an
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
allergic reaction from a food allergy
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
the percentage of children who admit to
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
being bullied because of their food
 
01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.910 align:start position:0%
being bullied because of their food
allergy

01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
allergy
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
and how it makes them different from
 
01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
other people in their class but i assume
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
and you all have heard today numerous
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
facts already so instead i'd like to
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
paint you a picture
 
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
you are a mother
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
or father of a child with a severe food
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
allergy you've kept them safe their
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
whole life
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
you check labels on everything you held
 
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
them out of summer camps because you
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
can't control the environment once
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're there
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're a master chef at home because
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
dining out with your family is simply
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
too risky
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
and you trained them to disclose their
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
allergies whenever they are out and to
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
avoid certain establishments
 
01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
you've put in the work
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
now they're headed off to college
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
but they're ready you've done everything
 
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
that you can do to prepare them to
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
handle life in the real world with a
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
food allergy
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
and i imagine this story is similar to
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
that of the hunger family
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
but it only takes one exposure
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
it only takes one instance where
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
something was not prepared properly or
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
without an educated staff
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
for all of that work that you've done to
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
be wiped away
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
one in 13 adults and children suffer
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
from food allergies as you've heard
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
from other people this morning
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
but imagine if that one in 13 was your
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
son your daughter your sister your
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
brother or your friend
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
rachel was that one person
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
and though we can't get her back my hope
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
is that this committee will see the need
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
to pass house bill 65
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
and require food service establishments
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
to do their part in preventing another
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
life from being taken too soon
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
we hope that you the committee members
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
will stand with us today
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
so those suffering from food allergies
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
no longer have to dine in fear that
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
their next bite could be their last
 
01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:46.790 align:start position:0%
their next bite could be their last
breath

01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
breath
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
very elegant description of the problem
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.709 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson has a
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
question if you're willing to entertain
 
01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:04.310 align:start position:0%
question if you're willing to entertain
one

01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
yes all right
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm having some
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
technical problems with uh raising my
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
hand for the last witness um but
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:30:14.239 --> 01:30:15.189 align:start position:0%
my question is
um

01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
would this bill as written have
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
prevented uh rachel's death
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
if it had been in place or would it at
 
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
least reduce the uh the chance of her
 
01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.870 align:start position:0%
least reduce the uh the chance of her
loss

01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
loss
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that it would have reduced the
 
01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.229 align:start position:0%
i believe that it would have reduced the
chances

01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
chances
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
of her loss um
 
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
obviously rachel was
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
very aware of her allergy and
 
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
disclosed that in many cases um
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
i can't say whether or not it would have
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
prevented it and i don't think that is
 
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.229 align:start position:0%
prevented it and i don't think that is
the

01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal of this
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
but in order
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
i believe the
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
the idea behind it is to give people
 
01:30:53.679 --> 01:30:54.709 align:start position:0%
the idea behind it is to give people
more

01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:30:54.719 --> 01:30:57.030 align:start position:0%
more
um

01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
more of a sense of
 
01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.629 align:start position:0%
more of a sense of
safety

01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
when dining out in food establishments
 
01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.669 align:start position:0%
when dining out in food establishments
follow-up

01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
further question and inquiry
 
01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh would you be amenable to an amendment
 
01:31:10.159 --> 01:31:11.510 align:start position:0%
uh would you be amenable to an amendment
that

01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
that attempted to accomplish the same
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
thing make sure that all of our
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
food preparers and food handlers
 
01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
um have additional uh
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
allergy training food allergy training
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
i would be in support of that
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
hey

01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
hey
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so um as usual happens when i
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
say there's only one left there's a
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
bunch more people signed up now these
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
people most of these people did sign up
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
ahead of time so i do feel somewhat uh
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
required to put them up but i can ask
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
all of you who are coming in is that
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
please not repeat what's already been
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
said um you are cutting into palestine
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
tableware so maybe you might hear about
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
that issue um so and i have a lot of
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
people signed up for that bill uh which
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'll tell them the same thing which is
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
please do not repeat yourself if you can
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
offer up something new that'd be great
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
so we'll start with nicole caruso
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i will promote you nicole
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
hi thank you so much for having me
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm here
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
to speak on a personal note um so this
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
will be a little different than i think
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
what you guys have heard
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
um i was a transfer student with rachel
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'm currently a senior at unh and i had
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
the honor of being her roommate
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
um for that first year we had together
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.870 align:start position:0%
and
we

01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
shared a very small square of a room
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
together and
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
that became very difficult once she was
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
in her coma
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
i moved my mattress and all of my things
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
into the living room of our apartment
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
because it was just too hard to
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
be in that room with her pictures
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
everywhere and um
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
i you know i got really used to hearing
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
her toes and her ankles crack as she'd
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
walk through our apartment
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
and she always claimed it was because of
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
she did leave behind her cat scurry as
 
01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:21.510 align:start position:0%
she did leave behind her cat scurry as
well

01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
with us and
 
01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:24.870 align:start position:0%
with us and
rachel

01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
rachel
 
01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:26.790 align:start position:0%
had always talked about
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:27.910 align:start position:0%
had always talked about
[Music]

01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
her future
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
and how she really wanted children and
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
she couldn't wait to help the world when
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
she graduated
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
and she always spoke about wanting to
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
reach a large demographic of people
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
rather than making an impact on a
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
smaller scale she wanted to work on a
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
larger scale
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
and that's a huge reason that i'm
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
supporting this law rachel's law is i
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
think that she would obviously
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely love it but i think it's a
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
great way to honor her in a way
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
that she would have loved because it was
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
something that she had always wanted to
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
gain in the life that she
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
had and unfortunately lost too soon
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
because of something that i feel could
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
i am also a person who has allergies
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
like rachel and i have been very shaken
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
by this tragedy not only losing somebody
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
but realizing how life-threatening
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
allergies can be on a more personal
 
01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:23.990 align:start position:0%
allergies can be on a more personal
level

01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.030 align:start position:0%
level
um

01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think this bill is so important not
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
only to me but to the unh community and
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
the medical community that never got to
 
01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
see rachel's braid ideas that she would
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
have brought to the world
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
and of course for the hungers who lost
 
01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
their daughter in a way that no one
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
would ever wish
 
01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:39.669 align:start position:0%
would ever wish
and

01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
rachel just deserved more than the time
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
she was given
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
and i think this law is a great step in
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
the right direction to make sure that no
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
family has to go through what the
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
hungers have gone through
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
that that's kind of shown
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
as people have spoken about you know the
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
1 in 13 people that do have allergies
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
it does need to be taken more seriously
 
01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:03.350 align:start position:0%
it does need to be taken more seriously
especially

01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
you know after
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
losing someone who meant a lot to you
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
and someone i considered one of my first
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
friends when i transferred to the
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire
 
01:35:12.159 --> 01:35:13.510 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire
um

01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.950 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.470 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's all i have to say
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
i apologize for my stuttering i was just
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%

and i'm here just to let you know that
 
01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.189 align:start position:0%
and i'm here just to let you know that
i'm

01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
available to answer any questions that
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
you may have with regard to current food
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
safety regulations in new hampshire
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
well the big question we're having right
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
now is is this this totally mere the one
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
that is the state regulation yes um and
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
and i guess the question was one was did
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
the state regulations say all menus
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
and boards
 
01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:27.910 align:start position:0%
and boards
and

01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
um and then the idea that there's a
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
full-time person on duty
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
so um i'll answer the first question
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to the menu board so with
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
the menu advisory that is required for
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
our undercooked foods that
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
their the statement is
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
brochures deli case or menu advisories
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
label statements table tens plate
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
placards or other effective written
 
01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:57.030 align:start position:0%
placards or other effective written
means

01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
that sounds like all
 
01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.350 align:start position:0%
that sounds like all
okay

01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so i i certainly um are uh i'm
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
aware that this that this bill proposes
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
rulemaking requirements so it is
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
possible that we could um
 
01:37:14.719 --> 01:37:16.149 align:start position:0%
possible that we could um
clarify

01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
the menu board aspect in rule or if
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
there was additional language
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
in this the statute
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
that would that would work as well to
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
further define out menu or menu boards
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay great and then the full-time person
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
on duty there's somebody on duty at all
 
01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:34.790 align:start position:0%
on duty there's somebody on duty at all
times

01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:35.590 align:start position:0%
times
so

01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
so currently uh the
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire rules for the sanitary
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
production and distribution of food has
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
incorporated the fda food code the 2017
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
version into its regulation and so that
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
requires the person in charge to be a
 
01:37:55.590 --> 01:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
certified food protection manager and as
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
was mentioned in previous testimony that
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
certified food protection manager
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
training does include allergy
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
food allergy recognition awareness of
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
symptoms and the expectation is is that
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
that person in charge transfers that
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
knowledge to food other food employees
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
under his or her supervision during that
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
their shift as their duties relate to
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
food allergen awareness so there are a
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
few types of establishments that are
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
currently exempt from the requirement
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
and those are those that
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
don't have food proper minimal or
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
or no food preparation so examples would
 
01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.189 align:start position:0%
or no food preparation so examples would
be

01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
like a dollar store that might be have a
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
food license because they sell milk and
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
eggs but they don't have food

although i am not a
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire resident i'm here today
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
in support of passing the house bill 65
 
01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
rachel's law
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
in october of 2019
 
01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
shortly after rachel had passed away i
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
was at breakfast with my family members
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
and my seven-year-old nephew has tree
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
nut allergies the first thing i stated
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
to the waitress was that we have a tree
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
nut allergy pointing to my nephew she
 
01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.590 align:start position:0%
nut allergy pointing to my nephew she
replied

01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
replied
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
no problem the only thing we have are
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
pecans and they are separated from the
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
other foods
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
not even five minutes later she brings
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
three containers of syrup for the
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
pancakes my nephew ordered
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
we are all talking and kale is reading
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
the container labels and i hear him say
 
01:41:08.159 --> 01:41:12.149 align:start position:0%
the container labels and i hear him say
pecan

01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
i picked up the syrup containers and
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
approached the waitress pointing out the
 
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
pecan syrup and explaining
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
cross-contamination with food allergies
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
can be fatal to people i know she did
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
not do this intentionally and it seems
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
like an innocent mistake to some to some
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
people but not to a person living with a
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
food allergy
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
having a designated restaurant employee
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
trained regarding food allergies can
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
prevent things like this
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
happening in restaurants it will save
 
01:41:39.199 --> 01:41:41.270 align:start position:0%
happening in restaurants it will save
lives

01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
lives
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
we can't put a dollar amount on
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
someone's life
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
and they deserve the right to enjoy a
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
meal out
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
it's too late to help rachel but this
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
bill could make a difference so other
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
friends and family members do not have
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
to suffer the loss of a loved one
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
make a difference be the miracle and
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
pass house bill 65 and i'm open for any
 
01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.229 align:start position:0%
pass house bill 65 and i'm open for any
questions

01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much for
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay kendra try again i promise i won't
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
throw you off
 
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
um i hope everyone has a warm mug of
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
something and some warm socks on in the
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
heater this morning because it is quite
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
chilly here in new hampshire my name is
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
kendra middleton and i am in favor of
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 65
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
rachel hunger was my best friend um
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
and on march 19th we went out to eat at
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
a restaurant that we frequented
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
all the time on campus in durham she
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
consistently had the same order and one
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
time we go out to eat and there was
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
cross-contamination and after two
 
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
epipens as you guys know the reaction
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
wound up being fatal the scariest part
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
about allergies is that everyone's can
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
change every few years
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
with more and more food becoming
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
processed on different equipment due to
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
keep up with demand of the population
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
allergies are becoming more and more
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
prominent and more and more severe
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
with more allergies coming up the amount
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
of people affected is going to continue
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
to grow especially here in new hampshire
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
this past october after 24 years of life
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
i found out that i have a deadly food
 
01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:18.629 align:start position:0%
i found out that i have a deadly food
allergy

01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
allergy
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
too artificial dye 24 years of life i
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
had survived without having a reaction
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
and one night at home with my roommates
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
had i arrived to the hospital five
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
minutes later i would have been rachel
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
and i promise you that after my
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
experience i know what anaphylaxis looks
 
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
like and thank god that i did because it
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
quite literally saved my life even
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
though i couldn't save hers
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
food allergy stats from the american
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
academy of allergy and asthma and
 
01:43:46.239 --> 01:43:47.750 align:start position:0%
academy of allergy and asthma and
immunology

01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
immunology
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
food allergies affect eight percent of
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
adults six percent of children zero to
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
two nine percent three to five eight
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
percent six to thirteen and eight and a
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
half percent between 14 and 18 and 38.7
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
of reactions are severe even if never
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
having one before and 30.4 percent of
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
people have multiple food allergies and
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
numbers are getting worse like i said
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
due to population and demands of food
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
why are restaurants important in this
 
01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:16.310 align:start position:0%
why are restaurants important in this
equation

01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
equation
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
one it's unrealistic for people to never
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
go out to eat i travel for a living and
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that if i didn't have the
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
option to go to restaurants i wouldn't
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
be able to do my job and keep a roof
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
over my head
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
two with an allergy to dies alone i
 
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
never know if i can even have pasta
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
sauce or edamame out at a restaurant and
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's outrageous to ask
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
people to understand what they are
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
putting on the table in front of people
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
three sometimes not always but you have
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
a waitress who doesn't seem to care
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't know or doesn't really want to
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
find out what they are putting in front
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
of you and that is fatal
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
fourth this is a minimal cost to
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
restaurants and like my mother said you
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
can't really put a dollar sign on
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
people's lives
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
and lastly this is life or death
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
and it's not something that is
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
likely to grow out of you know when
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
you're a kid you think people are going
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
to grow out of peanut allergies but it's
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
more likely that someone is going to
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
grow into an allergy
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
and this could prevent not an another 21
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
year old from
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
dying literally anyone so today you have
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to be on the right side
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
of history to save lives and to change
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of your population that is
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
affected by this and children that are
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
affected by this you are put in these
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
seats to positively positively impact
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
your community and today i hope you
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
choose to positively impact your
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
we do have a question if you're willing
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
to entertain one
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative abramson has a question
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question um do you happen to
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
know of durham is one of the towns
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's uh exempt from state requirements
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
because they use a their own process
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
um i am not sure i would assume not
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
because this was a restaurant that
 
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
before we had informed her of her
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
allergy and she continued to order the
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
same menu items which is why on this
 
01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
particular occasion she did not inform
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
them because they were things that she
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
had ordered on menus before
 
01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:10.870 align:start position:0%
had ordered on menus before
follow-up

01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
for the question main choir
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
and uh would you also be open to
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the bill
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
that attempts to accomplish the same
 
01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:20.870 align:start position:0%
that attempts to accomplish the same
thing

01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
um yes i would as someone who suffers
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
with food allergies i i think it's
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
important to pass this because it
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
affects not only adults but children and
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
not only new hampshire but everywhere
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.080 align:start position:0%

hampshire i personally never knew rachel
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
but her experiences deeply resonated
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
with me
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
after hearing rachel's story i knew i
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
had to share my two in the effort to
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
help i have both a raw egg allergy and
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
nut allergy and these are both
 
01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:10.629 align:start position:0%
nut allergy and these are both
anaphylactic

01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
anaphylactic
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
my first weekend as a freshman at unh i
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
went to
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
get dinner at one of the dining halls
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
after one
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
bite into a piece of shrimp cooked at
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
the stir-fry bar i knew i instantly was
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
in trouble
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
thankfully due to quick action i was
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
able to get help
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
from an emt before going into
 
01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:30.709 align:start position:0%
from an emt before going into
anaphylaxis

01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
anaphylaxis
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
i went to the dining hall knowing my
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
allergies knowing how anaphylaxis works
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
knowing how to assess food for risk but
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
due to improper cleaning and knowledge
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
of cross-contamination by a staff member
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
i left the dining hall on my first
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
weekend of college headed into an
 
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.750 align:start position:0%

01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%

girlfriend
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
after back and forth of me explaining my
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
allergies to the server the restaurant
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
decided that they could not serve me
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
they let me let me say that again i was
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
explaining my allergy to the server i
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
was leaving my anaphylactic allergy to
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
the server who did not understand my
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
common egg allergy
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
all i asked was that my food be cooked
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
on a separate and clean surface which is
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
common food allergy protocol
 
01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
on a different day i headed to
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
portsmouth to get food with a group of
 
01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:19.430 align:start position:0%
portsmouth to get food with a group of
friends

01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
friends
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
i did my part in telling the server my
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
allergies like i do every single time
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
after them coming back to my table to
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
ask exactly what my allergy was three
 
01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:28.870 align:start position:0%
ask exactly what my allergy was three
times

01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
they brought our table's food out but
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
mine did not come they had the manager
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
come over and explain that he did not
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
know enough about the allergy to cook my
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
meal safely i asked myself as i watched
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
my friends enjoy their meal in front of
 
01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:42.390 align:start position:0%
my friends enjoy their meal in front of
me

01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
how does the manager of a large
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant know not know enough about a
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
major allergy which was egg to refuse to
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
serve a customer
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
therefore staff members need to be
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
educated and trained
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
simple education can lead to
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
improvements for customers experiences
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
this common feeling this is a common
 
01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:03.510 align:start position:0%
this common feeling this is a common

feeling
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
for people with allergies
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
and if this continues this will there
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
will be another story of someone losing
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
their life
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
simple training of staff to understand
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
common allergies will help prevent out
 
01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:15.990 align:start position:0%
common allergies will help prevent out
reactions

01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
reactions

01:50:34.159 --> 01:50:35.270 align:start position:0%
death for young people is important to
me

01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to speak to you today as
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
as somebody who understands to some
 
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
extent the political process of making
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
change i'm on a school board in concord
 
01:50:45.590 --> 01:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
so any any of you know the last couple
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
years in the concord school district
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
have been horrifying um we've had
 
01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
horrible things happen in our district
 
01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
that affect young people sitting on a
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
board an elected board being challenged
 
01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
with the task of keeping children safe
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
is is a huge responsibility so i'm going
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
to ask all of you as legislators here
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
to take out the details of what food
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
allergies do on tuesday versus friday
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
and how different is an egg allergy to a
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
peanut allergy
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
um those things aren't the issue in this
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
bill here
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
anytime we have a tragedy um society
 
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
does the right thing and looks at what
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
can we do to change the outcome for
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
future families
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
what killed my molly shouldn't have to
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
kill other people what killed rachel
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to kill other people
 
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm old i'm 57 so in the early 80s i
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
was a cocktail waitress and that was a
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
time when everybody drank lots of
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
alcohol everywhere
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
my dad put it in his car driving to the
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
golf course it was a very very different
 
01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:41.189 align:start position:0%
golf course it was a very very different
time

01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
and then we had mothers against drunk
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
driving and we had
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
a nationwide drinking age of 21 and if
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
you all will recall that that change was
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
met with a lot of pushback people didn't
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
want to change change isn't easy change
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
can be difficult and uncomfortable
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
but to those moms and dads who lost
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
children to drunk driving it was
 
01:52:02.229 --> 01:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
imperative that we as a culture make a
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
change and we did and now we don't think
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
twice about things
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
local bars don't overserve patrons
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
anymore because they realize there's a
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
liability to them
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
the next thing that comes to mind for me
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
is when we were redoing main street on
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
downtown all the hubbub and the talk
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
about how to make all of our stores
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
handicapped accessible sure i have two
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
legs that work so what do i care if
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
there's a ramp or not well how lucky am
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
i that my legs work but to someone who's
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
confined to a chair and wants to have a
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
donut or a bagel or buy a book getting
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
into the store is incredibly important
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
so as a school board member looking at
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
policies around hiring educators around
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
holding educators accountable for
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate behavior around making sure
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
they're teaching in a way that services
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
all students and not just those that are
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to learn in a normal way
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
we i spend hours and hours pondering the
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
children that are different
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
so all of all of the details of this
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
bill we could go round and round for
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
hours it's too specific it's not
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
specific enough can we put stickers on
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
every menu what about if you call online
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely these are things to consider
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
but they have nothing to do with passing
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
this bill knowledge is power we take a
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
step for rachel
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
and and somebody else's rachel is going
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
to benefit from that
 
01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:16.950 align:start position:0%
to benefit from that
um

01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm in huge support of this
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
bill i i relate as the mother of a child
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
in heaven i relate as a board member who
 
01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
works really hard to protect children um
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
and i represent someone that
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
if i had a lobster it would be very very
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
ugly um so so i have it all i'll end
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
with an experience that my daughter
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
gracie had um on christmas eve she had a
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
muffin and according to the ingredients
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
of the muffins she's not allergic to any
 
01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
of them but she ended up epipendant at
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
the er the owner of the bakery small
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
concord establishment said to me
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
i never lose a sale on an item without
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
nuts i can't tell you the number of
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
muffins i haven't sold have nuts in them
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
so i do feel this type of education and
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
legislation will improve service at
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants and improve revenue
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
because again we don't we don't lose
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
money um on on allergy free foods and
 
01:54:08.159 --> 01:54:09.430 align:start position:0%
money um on on allergy free foods and
products

01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
so i would encourage you to pass this
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
bill um take take that
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
checking off every little detail hat and
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
put on the common sense hat
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
and know that educating and training our
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant staff will only be a good
 
01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:23.510 align:start position:0%
restaurant staff will only be a good
thing

01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
seeing your questions we thank you very
 
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
much thank you um i see jennifer hunger
 
01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:51.669 align:start position:0%
 
hi

01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
welcome back to the car i'm on my
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
daughter's computer so bear with me for
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
a second okay
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to operate this one um
 
01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:01.510 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to operate this one um
hi

01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
honestly i just really want to address a
 
01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
couple of things i want to say that
 
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
i have six days between finding out that
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
this committee was meeting over this
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill and and this morning
 
01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
and you can see the amount of people
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
that i was able to connect with who feel
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
so strongly about this that they wanted
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:25.750 align:start position:0%
to speak
um

01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
the amount of people i could get if i
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
had more than six days would be daunting
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
there's there's
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
if this issue affects one in 13 people
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
then imagine the amount of people that
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
it touches that don't have the allergy
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
that just care about that one in 13
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
person if you don't have that person
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know i'm grateful for you
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know i no longer have that person so
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
this i can go to a restaurant and not
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily think about food allergies
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
like i used to
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
but the amount of people who've reached
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
out to me in the last six days in
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
support of this and told shared their
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
story with me
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
just made me remember
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
all of those other people's rachel's
 
01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:08.390 align:start position:0%
all of those other people's rachel's
that

01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
might be helped with this bill
 
01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:12.149 align:start position:0%
might be helped with this bill
um

01:56:12.149 --> 01:56:12.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
i don't want i i don't want this bill to
 
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
be seen as something that is putting a
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
burden on a restaurant
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
i think that the idea that the person
 
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
with the allergy is suddenly going to be
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
able to go out and dine and feel safe is
 
01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
we never feel safe all we would hope is
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
that there would be some sort of
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the staff at the
 
01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
restaurant and the person with the
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
allergy to do the best that they could
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
to prevent
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
um you know a tragedy from happening
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
does it eliminate risk of course not
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and the person who's taking the risk
 
01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
i can assure you knows that they're
 
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
taking a risk
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
but the expectation that maybe the rest
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the community could support them in
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
making an educated decision about what
 
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
they're eating and make them feel like
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the risk is a little bit smaller
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
is all that we're hoping for
 
01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
the only other thing i want to say is
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
that epipens
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
and epinephrine
 
01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
is touted as like the the thing that's
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to just just epi just eat it and
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
if there's if it had it then you just
 
01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
epipen my daughter had two epipens and
 
01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
the ambulance made it in three minutes
 
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
to unh
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
and that was not enough so epinephrine
 
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
is great and it has saved a lot of
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
people it didn't it doesn't always it
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily always save you so
 
01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:38.390 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily always save you so
um

01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
that just speaks to the seriousness of
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the food allergies and that it there
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
is no vaccine there is no cure there is
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
no anything and these people you know
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
this is their daily life every day that
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
they eat something
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
they're at risk so if this could just
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
lessen the risk that that's our hope
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
so glad you you got on thank you thank
 
01:58:01.679 --> 01:58:04.070 align:start position:0%
so glad you you got on thank you thank

01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions we thank you again
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh barbara

okay so uh now
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
i have two more left
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.159 --> 01:58:28.149 align:start position:0%
 
hi

01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
just thank you all for
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
being here listening to everybody's
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
different opinions i for one am
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely in favor of house bill uh 65
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
rachel's law i was a friend of rachel's
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to say that
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
um pretty much here today i just want to
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
say that to me this law
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
is just a way to ensure that people that
 
01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
want to go out and have a bite to eat at
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
a restaurant can do exactly that they
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
can just have the night be
 
01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
a nice
 
01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
outing eating what they want doing what
 
01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
they want because people with allergies
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
are gonna do what they need to do to
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
make themselves feel better
 
01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
but they shouldn't have to do
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
everything by themselves the burden
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just be on them people that
 
01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
are serving food should be aware of what
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
is put in that food and what is being
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
put on that table to someone that
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't just dislike something but it
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
can in fact change or even end their
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
lives someone like myself who's worked
 
01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
in a restaurant i've seen firsthand that
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
not everybody serving food running knows
 
01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
every item on the menu let alone every
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
single ingredient and
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
personally i believe that that needs to
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
change because it's not just about like
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
or dislike it's literally a matter of
 
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
life and death and like so many have
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
said before
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
it's not always realistic to say just
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
don't go out to eat because
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
some people like kendra travel for a
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
living or some people
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
just enjoy going out to eat and that
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be something that's completely
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
off the table
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
and i just gonna keep it short and sweet
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm in full full support of this and
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
much love to the hunger family always
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:14.070 --> 02:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
one person left
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:29.189 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:29.199 --> 02:00:32.310 align:start position:0%
and
jody

02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead go ahead johnny yeah oh you've
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
muted and unmuted yourself so
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're still muted judy i'm sorry about
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
that i had a little technical difficulty
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you for listening to me and i'm
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
in full support of hb65 i tried to edit
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
my um
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
my uh talking points as best i can um
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
try going to just read through it and
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully not repeat too many things
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
for sake of time
 
02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:11.679 align:start position:0%
i became aware of the danger of food
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
allergy the day i nearly killed my son
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
at the age of 22 months
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
i gave him a peanut butter cracker and
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
within seconds his body reacted
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
face and eyes swollen like a boxer who
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
is on the losing end of 11 rounds
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
vomiting and lethargy and his little
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
voice saying help me mama
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
that was the day i understood how lethal
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
food can be my son's allergies told me
 
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's likely a next reaction would be
 
02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:40.870 align:start position:0%
it's likely a next reaction would be
worse

02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
worse
 
02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
we eat out at establishments and trust
 
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
that employees and management of these
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
establishments understand what food
 
02:01:50.709 --> 02:01:50.719 align:start position:0%
allergies are to minimize our risk
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes we hit the jackpot with
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
restaurants like t-bones
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
the servers kitchen staff and management
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
are all very educated on food allergy
 
02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
and take it very seriously we are
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
confident that these people are using
 
02:02:06.070 --> 02:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
the same care and making themselves
 
02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
aware of the ingredients in their food
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
how it was pre-prepared in an outside
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
facility prior to reaching their
 
02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:14.709 align:start position:0%
facility prior to reaching their
establishment

02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
how they prepare the food in their
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
kitchen and how it is served to prevent
 
02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:21.109 align:start position:0%
kitchen and how it is served to prevent
cross-contamination

02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
cross-contamination
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
just like i do every single time before
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
a food item goes into my son's mouth
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
we have also stopped at food
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
establishments and when made aware of my
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
son's peanut and trina allergies
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
we are made acutely aware we are a
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
nuisance and told well that food doesn't
 
02:02:41.109 --> 02:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
have nuts and we have walked out without
 
02:02:41.119 --> 02:02:42.070 align:start position:0%
have nuts and we have walked out without
eating

02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
eating
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
we cannot trust our son's life to an
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
establishment like that generally i
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
think it's not so much a lack of care
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
but rather a lack of understanding
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
many people think that as long as we
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
have the epipen we are fine if he starts
 
02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
to swell up just jab him
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
the reality of the epipen is
 
02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
that it's just buying your time to get
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
to the hospital
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
and just like rachel it's not a cure and
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a guarantee that it will save
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
my child's life
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
this legislation is crucial to implement
 
02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
along with other food handling education
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
a food protection manager
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
would be an employee who would be the

allergy expert on duty
 
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
crucial to understanding and
 
02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:30.390 align:start position:0%
crucial to understanding and
communicating

02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%

foodallergy.org childhood
 
02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations for food allergies
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
tripled between the late 1990s and mid
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
2000s and unfortunately allergies aren't
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
going away
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
due to our diligence and the responsible
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
actions of the restaurants we frequent
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
and by the grace of god our son has
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
never had another anaphylactic reaction
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
but the reality is that my son could be
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
just one french toast sirloin steak
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%

02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
let rachel's life mean something great
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
and protect other anaphylactic food
 
02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:13.990 align:start position:0%
and protect other anaphylactic food

02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
um seeing no more questions i guess
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
we're all set thank you very much uh
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
i have no more hands up so i will close
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh we had
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
252 people and sent a response in
 
02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:35.430 align:start position:0%
252 people and sent a response in
support

02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh seven opposed and two are neutral and
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
with that we'll close the public hearing
 
02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:43.930 align:start position:0%
and move on to our last bill
 
02:04:43.930 --> 02:04:45.510 align:start position:0%
and move on to our last bill

so i would ask those who are going to
 
02:04:56.550 --> 02:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill to please raise your
 
02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:58.149 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill to please raise your
hand

02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
hand

hand
and

02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
go get my
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:08.719 --> 02:05:11.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
all right dude i'm gonna
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.599 --> 02:05:20.950 align:start position:0%

welcome back to the commerce committee
 
02:05:25.119 --> 02:05:28.310 align:start position:0%
welcome back to the commerce committee
ready

02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
have i
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
i don't see myself representative hunt
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh well that's true we can't see you
 
02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
either you have to turn your video on
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%
there it is
 
02:05:39.679 --> 02:05:41.270 align:start position:0%
there it is
yes

02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
no you turned it off
 
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
oh no you're no you just moved oh yeah
 
02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
these screens moving around on me okay
 
02:05:50.149 --> 02:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
okay well as they say in the interest of
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
time out of an abundance of caution
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
i will try to keep this brief i also we
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
also have a lot of people who have a lot
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
more information than i think is
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
that you need to hear from me so i will
 
02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
try to introduce this bill
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
as briefly as possible i sent the
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
testimony to
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
to the committee i thought last night
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
but commerce apparently has two m's in
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
it so i had to try again this morning
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
so you should have my testimony
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
you've probably heard by the way
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
a duplication of house bill 1564
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
which was passed by this committee last
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
last session and passed by the house and
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
it suffered the
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
tabling by the uh by the senate as many
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
of our good bills have
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
you've probably heard that you should
 
02:06:48.390 --> 02:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
never heat up food or beverage in a
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
styrofoam cup because there are toxins
 
02:06:54.550 --> 02:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
that will be released in the food
 
02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
but we buy hot beverages and prepared
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
food and these containers routinely
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
after all that's the principal reason
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
why we use styrofoam is it retains heat
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
and cold
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
styrene is the toxin that styrofoam is
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
made from and it has been found to leach
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
into food
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
foam cups lose weight each time they're
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
used as we ingest the styrene
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
volatile styrene monomers are found in
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
the shells of eggs that are stored for
 
02:07:30.149 --> 02:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
two weeks in polystyrene containers and
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
dishes cooked with these eggs contain
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
seven times more ethyl benzene as
 
02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
styrene than those that are packed in
 
02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
other containers such as cardboard
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer of polystyrene is the
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
fifth largest creator of hazardous waste
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
both liquid and solid
 
02:07:50.079 --> 02:07:51.189 align:start position:0%
both liquid and solid
now

02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things that got me very
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
interested in this is that the fact that
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
styrofoam products comprise an offensive
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
amount of litter that we're seeing along
 
02:08:01.199 --> 02:08:02.550 align:start position:0%
amount of litter that we're seeing along
roadways

02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
roadways
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
and um i spend a lot of time on the sea
 
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
and on the beaches and floating in
 
02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.189 align:start position:0%
and on the beaches and floating in
masses

02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
masses
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
on the ocean
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
completely unnecessary
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
others who testify will tell you about
 
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
the widespread use
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
widespread styrofoam debris that happens
 
02:08:22.709 --> 02:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
when it breaks up into smaller pieces
 
02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
and gets either wind or water carried
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
and it causes cancer and digestive
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
problems for wildlife
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's no way to get rid of it
 
02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
it can't be readily composted it can't
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
be right recycled and if it burned it
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
releases 57 chemical byproducts this
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't surprise you
 
02:08:48.870 --> 02:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
in 2017 new york city released its
 
02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
determination on the recyclability
 
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
of food service foam
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
in summary it said for 30 years attempts
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
to recycle food service foam both
 
02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
subsidized and non-subsidized attempts
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
have failed at each step of the
 
02:09:08.069 --> 02:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
recycling process the municipalities and
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
programs at dsny research tell a very
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
clear story and i'm still quoting
 
02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
food service foam is not capable of
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
being recycled in an environmentally
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
effective or an economically feasible
 
02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:23.669 align:start position:0%
effective or an economically feasible
manner

02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
manner
 
02:09:26.550 --> 02:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
again to quote from this report the
 
02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities found that food service
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
foam compacts and collection trucks
 
02:09:34.229 --> 02:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
breaks into bits and becomes covered in
 
02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
food residue making it worthless when it
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
arrived at a recycling
 
02:09:39.119 --> 02:09:40.390 align:start position:0%
arrived at a recycling
facility

02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
and contaminating other other recycled
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
materials as well
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
it blows throughout the
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
material recovery facility missed by
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
manual sorters mistakenly moves with the
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
paper material and contaminates other
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
valuable recycling streams namely paper
 
02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
which can be our most valuable commodity
 
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
in a recycling program
 
02:10:10.069 --> 02:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
food service foam is too costly to clean
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
and process compared to the virgin
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
material and that comes from the 2017
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
stores and food service businesses are
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
already using paper products to replace
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
styrofoam thank goodness we can get
 
02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
coffee where the it actually tastes good
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's doable we need to pass this
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislation to take a first very
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
achievable step toward eliminating
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
polystyrene from new hampshire
 
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
and beyond i would be happy to answer
 
02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
questions about the mechanics of the
 
02:10:47.119 --> 02:10:51.270 align:start position:0%
questions about the mechanics of the
bill

02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
great we do have questions
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll start with uh representative
 
02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
and we'll start with uh representative
burrows

02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
burrows
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you for taking my question
 
02:11:04.149 --> 02:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
um you might have started to touch on
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
this when my phone started ringing so if
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
i missed it i apologize i'm wondering if
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
there are eco-friendly alternatives to
 
02:11:14.550 --> 02:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
the um to the styrofoam and how do they
 
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
compare price-wise
 
02:11:19.109 --> 02:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
there absolutely are i think that we've
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
already seen it when you buy uh coffee
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
now you're very unlikely to get it in
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
styrofoam you're more likely to get it
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
in paper products
 
02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
i actually contacted a
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
a country store that exports a good deal
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
of its material so i bought some cheese
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
from them and it was sent out
 
02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:42.470 align:start position:0%
from them and it was sent out
and

02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:45.189 --> 02:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
and it needed to be kept cold and i said
 
02:11:45.199 --> 02:11:46.550 align:start position:0%
and it needed to be kept cold and i said
surely

02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
surely
 
02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
you need to use styrofoam for this and
 
02:11:50.709 --> 02:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
they said we wouldn't think of it
 
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
we use
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
shredded cardboard products
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
so it's entirely doable
 
02:12:02.229 --> 02:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
styrofoam is like many things it's
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
it's very um it's very cheap
 
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
the hydrocarbon industry is anxious to
 
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
to make it because it is
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh it uses up uh
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
hydrocarbons that they are anxious to
 
02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
find new
 
02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:21.350 align:start position:0%
find new
new

02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
but the
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
the impact and i think other people will
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
talk to you about
 
02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
about what happens when it gets into our
 
02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:35.510 align:start position:0%
about what happens when it gets into our
environment

02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:12:38.069 --> 02:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
and how much it costs to clean it up
 
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
shows that there is
 
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
a bigger financial issue issue than just
 
02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
the cost of that cup
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
to the manufacturer
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question thank
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative uh fargo is next
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um and thank
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
you representative spang could you speak
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
to the exemptions in the bill
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and and explain why these exemptions
 
02:13:12.390 --> 02:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
are here
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
yes the exemptions
 
02:13:17.109 --> 02:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
which you'll notice is the factory
 
02:13:17.119 --> 02:13:18.550 align:start position:0%
which you'll notice is the factory
sealed

02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
sealed
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
packaged shelf stable foods
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
and uncooked meat fish and poultry and
 
02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.149 align:start position:0%
and uncooked meat fish and poultry and
seafood

02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
seafood
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
are our health issues we want to make
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
sure that we're able to particularly
 
02:13:35.189 --> 02:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
with the uncooked
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
meat fish and poultry it is a good way
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that what is leaving the
 
02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
the factory is indeed getting to the
 
02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:44.870 align:start position:0%
the factory is indeed getting to the
stores

02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
stores
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
in a sanitary way
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
so it was felt that that needed to be an
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
exemption for the time being until we
 
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
can find some other way to do that
 
02:13:57.040 --> 02:13:58.950 align:start position:0%
can find some other way to do that
also

02:13:58.950 --> 02:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:14:00.149 --> 02:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
a little
 
02:14:02.229 --> 02:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
the little country store that i was
 
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
talking to said well sometimes we get
 
02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
things that are come to us packaged in
 
02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:08.390 align:start position:0%
things that are come to us packaged in
styrene

02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
styrene
 
02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
um and what are we supposed to do about
 
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
that and is it okay for us to uh to
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
accept these
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
and it seemed that if it's we we can do
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
what we want to control what's happening
 
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
to styrene within our own borders to
 
02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.030 align:start position:0%
to styrene within our own borders to
start

02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
start
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
that will be spreading and i know it is
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
spreading um there are probably five
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
states that have already been
 
02:14:35.589 --> 02:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
polystyrene food containers and
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
more than just food containers
 
02:14:41.109 --> 02:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
02:14:41.119 --> 02:14:45.350 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
abramson

02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:46.709 --> 02:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
um so apparently polystyrene is uh if
 
02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
you heat it up too much
 
02:14:56.550 --> 02:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
it can release chemicals into the food
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
is one of the problems i've noticed um
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
is it a problem for for cold foods i
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
know when i go to my uh
 
02:15:06.790 --> 02:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
volunteered at the local uh
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
community table
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
that uh they used polystyrene containers
 
02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%
a lot for to go
 
02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
items when they had recycle you know
 
02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
when they had leftover foods and whatnot
 
02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
those are usually uh cold or cooled down
 
02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
um is that a problem for
 
02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
for lower temperature
 
02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:26.310 align:start position:0%
for lower temperature
foods

02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
foods
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question uh
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
representative abramson
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
the finding that eggs stored in
 
02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
styrofoam containers probably answer
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
that question
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
i was able to cite some statistics about
 
02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
how much
 
02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
how many toxins migrate from the eggs
 
02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
into the polystyrene even though they're
 
02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:49.510 align:start position:0%
into the polystyrene even though they're
kept

02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
kept
 
02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:51.109 align:start position:0%
kept
chilled

02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
chilled
 
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
but of course
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
i was i was raised to never put a
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
styrofoam container in the microwave for
 
02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:00.629 align:start position:0%
styrofoam container in the microwave for
example

02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
but the cold is something that was
 
02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
new to me too representative
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
some of us have stopped frequenting
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
restaurants that will um use
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
polystyrene for takeout johnson's dairy
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
bar won't change their position in a

i would believe that
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%

there you go
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman hunt and

02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
expanded polystyrene foam is toxic to
 
02:17:35.349 --> 02:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
produce and its chemical components bio
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
accumulate once they're in the body due
 
02:17:39.750 --> 02:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
to either food contamination or
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
economics eps food wear is not recycled
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
and it easily fragments into tiny
 
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
lightweight pieces impossible to contain
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
and non-biodegradable
 
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
all of this adds up to a high social
 
02:17:54.070 --> 02:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
cost that is currently not factored in
 
02:17:56.309 --> 02:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
therefore we see that eps containers are
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
cheap and thrown out after just a single
 
02:17:58.559 --> 02:17:59.990 align:start position:0%
cheap and thrown out after just a single
use

02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire would not be alone in
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
taking action on this public and
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
environmental health threat as rep
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative spang noted
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
five other states have passed or enacted
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
legislation banning the use of
 
02:18:13.589 --> 02:18:13.599 align:start position:0%
polystyrene foam food wear even in the
 
02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
face of this ongoing pandemic
 
02:18:18.389 --> 02:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
i'm proud to say that portsmouth my city
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
of residence has joined many
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
other municipalities throughout the
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
country by enacting a polystyrene foam
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
foodware ban as of this past december
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
31st 2020.
 
02:18:30.790 --> 02:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
and as a customer of portsmouth
 
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
restaurants and cafes over the past
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
eight years i've personally witnessed
 
02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:37.519 align:start position:0%
that those that choose not to use
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
polystyrene enjoy a high degree of
 
02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:41.030 align:start position:0%
polystyrene enjoy a high degree of
patronage

02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
patronage
 
02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
specifically because of their choice to
 
02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
implement other alternatives
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's landfills are nearing
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
capacity both tipping and transport fees
 
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
increasingly weigh on municipal budgets
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
the need for source reduction has never
 
02:18:57.990 --> 02:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
been greater and it aptly sits at the
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
top of our state's waste management
 
02:18:59.599 --> 02:19:00.870 align:start position:0%
top of our state's waste management
hierarchy

02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
hierarchy
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
section 2 of 149-m states that the
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
general court declares its concern that
 
02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
there are environmental and economic
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
issues pertaining to the disposal of
 
02:19:12.309 --> 02:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
solid waste and landfills and
 
02:19:12.319 --> 02:19:13.589 align:start position:0%
solid waste and landfills and
incinerators

02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
incinerators
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
it is important to reserve landfill and
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
incinerator capacity for solid waste
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
which cannot be reduced reused recycled
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
or composted
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
so on under 149-m municipalities are
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
currently allowed to regulate solid
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
waste without explicitly laboriously or
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
needlessly listing every waste item
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
polystyrene is an item we can reduce
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
where any net impact is offset both by
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
societal and waste disposal costs
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
i think that this is a small common
 
02:19:46.709 --> 02:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
sense in the right direction and i very
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
much appreciate your time and
 
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
consideration to favorably vote this
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
bill out of committee thank you
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh we do have a
 
02:19:56.309 --> 02:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
question uh representative abramson has
 
02:19:57.429 --> 02:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
a question
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
i was just thinking i i live in seabrook
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
and we're right on the border and about
 
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
half of our food delivery from the last
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
bill previous bill
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
half of our food delivery comes in from
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
north shore mass and about half of it
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
comes from businesses in new hampshire
 
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if this bill is meant is
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
meant to have an
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
impact on food delivery what happens if
 
02:20:24.469 --> 02:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
you have businesses restaurants from out
 
02:20:26.950 --> 02:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
of state trying to make a delivery
 
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
and they put their food in a polystyrene
 
02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:32.550 align:start position:0%
and they put their food in a polystyrene
container

02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
um i am going to actually defer to rep
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative spang on that one um i
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
from my understanding it's um
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
you know from takeout from businesses
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
that are in state that are offering
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
um that are packaging it rather
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
for transport from that restaurant
 
02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
for transport from that restaurant
follow-up

02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:20:56.309 --> 02:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
for the question main choir
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
okay okay well i guess for whoever wants
 
02:20:59.910 --> 02:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
to take it wouldn't that put new
 
02:21:01.349 --> 02:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses new hampshire
 
02:21:04.230 --> 02:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
restaurants especially at a
 
02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
disadvantage since it won't it might
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
only apply to businesses in new
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire and not
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
maine vermont or massachusetts could
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
they i would note here that maine um
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
you know it although you could say other
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
states you know it's a matter of time
 
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
this is happening um in surrounding
 
02:21:28.389 --> 02:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
states so
 
02:21:30.389 --> 02:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
i would say in the build there is a
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
section three uh this section shall not
 
02:21:33.910 --> 02:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
prohibit a person from reusing
 
02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
polystyrene packaging received from
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
products distributed from out of state
 
02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the chair will change a
 
02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:45.429 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the chair will change a
little

02:21:45.429 --> 02:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh let's go
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
those who are opposed to the bill
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm now calling up
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
good morning good morn good morning can
 
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:05.920 align:start position:0%

02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
excellent well good morning chairman
 
02:22:09.030 --> 02:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
hunt and members of the committee my
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
name is omar terry i'm with the american
 
02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
chemistry council and i am here to
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
respectfully oppose hb628
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
um as you all know especially when it
 
02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
comes to restaurants this is a terrible
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely terrible time to be
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
considering banning polystyrene foam
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
food service
 
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
restaurants need every opportunity they
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
can to continue to stay alive and that
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
includes with food service where
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
both polystyrene foam as well as
 
02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:37.270 align:start position:0%
both polystyrene foam as well as
alternatives

02:22:37.270 --> 02:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
so restaurants are holding on for dear
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
life and every cent counts and
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
it is an extremely affordable option
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
that continues to help restaurants in
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:49.910 --> 02:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
but you know there are people that are
 
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
really concerned with um diversion from
 
02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:54.070 align:start position:0%
really concerned with um diversion from
the

02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:55.349 align:start position:0%
the
um

02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:57.670 --> 02:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
the landfills and recycling and so there
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
are new advanced recycling technologies
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
that are coming online to address
 
02:23:03.910 --> 02:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
polystyrene foam food service as well as
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
plastics in general
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's an umbrella term called advanced
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
recycling but basically this technology
 
02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
is able to take a polystyrene foam food
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
service where and separate out the
 
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
contaminants from like your general
 
02:23:19.830 --> 02:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
sauce chicken in your polystyrene foam
 
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
clam shell
 
02:23:24.309 --> 02:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
and then turn that clam shell back into
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
a new clamshell to be utilized again so
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
this technology not only recycles the
 
02:23:31.830 --> 02:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
product but it also acts as a diversion
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
technology to help out with landfill
 
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.110 align:start position:0%
technology to help out with landfill
space

02:23:35.110 --> 02:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
space
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
um there are examples around the country
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
where this is taking place one is uh in
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
oregon by a company called agilex which
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
is utilizing this when it comes to
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
polystyrene foam cups at
 
02:23:50.309 --> 02:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
music venues as well as all other types
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
of food service throughout the state
 
02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
ineo style revolutions is a company that
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
is building a polystyrene recycling
 
02:24:00.630 --> 02:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
plant in illinois that will be recycling
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
100 tons of polystyrene a day once it's
 
02:24:04.319 --> 02:24:05.590 align:start position:0%
100 tons of polystyrene a day once it's
operational

02:24:05.590 --> 02:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
operational
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
and then another example is in georgia
 
02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:10.230 align:start position:0%
and then another example is in georgia
where

02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
a company called nexus fuels is taking
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
polystyrene as well as additional
 
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
plastics and turning that into fuels and
 
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
waxes and shipping that off to shell
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
chemicals so that they can utilize um
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
this new
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
um you know polystyrene foam as well as
 
02:24:30.399 --> 02:24:31.190 align:start position:0%
um you know polystyrene foam as well as
other

02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
fuels that are coming from the feedstock
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
so that they can divert from taking
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
virgin material so it's making that
 
02:24:40.630 --> 02:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
closed loop that we're looking for
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
i would like to point out that there are
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
several states that have already passed
 
02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling technology
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
bills uh to you know make sure this
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
technology is seen as manufacturing uh
 
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
most recently pennsylvania passed this
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
law last year
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
in addition to pennsylvania
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
florida wisconsin georgia iowa tennessee
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
texas ohio and illinois have also passed
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
bills that would be pushing forward and
 
02:25:10.710 --> 02:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
we would love to have something in the
 
02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
northeast uh possibly in new hampshire
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
as well um i want to keep this brief i
 
02:25:17.590 --> 02:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
know you guys have had a lot of uh
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
incoming and we'll continue to do so so
 
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
with that i'll open it up to questions
 
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
okay we do have several questions
 
02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs from the
 
02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:26.309 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs from the
inquiry

02:25:26.309 --> 02:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you mr o'terry for taking
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
my question um and that is that the um
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:25:35.359 --> 02:25:36.469 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
listed

02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
listed
 
02:25:39.750 --> 02:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
um the the styrofoam is a carcinogen
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
as carcinogenic and that hot foods can
 
02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
start a breakdown i'm causing some
 
02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
toxins to be released into the
 
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
bloodstream is that a concern of yours
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay so that's a that's a two-part
 
02:25:55.349 --> 02:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
question if i can you know take the time
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
to to answer that um first when it comes
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
to the possible carcinogen um
 
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
there is a study out from irk um
 
02:26:07.590 --> 02:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
in europe that is that moved it from a
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
possible carcinogen to a probable
 
02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
carcinogen um
 
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
one of the issues with the study is that
 
02:26:16.630 --> 02:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
iarc only uses a
 
02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
what's called a um
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
hazard assessment as opposed to a
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
two-step process which also incorporates
 
02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
an exposure assessment most health
 
02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh most health departments around the
 
02:26:31.030 --> 02:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
world utilize that two-step process of
 
02:26:33.030 --> 02:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
not only is something considered a
 
02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
hazard but at what point is it a hazard
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
and that's called exposure
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the reason why professionals do that
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
represented burroughs is because
 
02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
for example with water water
 
02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
is technically drinking too much water
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
is technically a hazard for the human
 
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
body so if you only stay with a hazard
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
assessment um almost anything can kill
 
02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
you right but the critical piece is at a
 
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
risk assessment at what point does a
 
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
substance become a
 
02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:05.910 align:start position:0%
substance become a
concern

02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
and for exposure
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
and the information that is currently
 
02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
out in the field we don't have a risk
 
02:27:15.429 --> 02:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
assessment on that level for styrene in
 
02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
addition to that
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
i do know that there is a organization
 
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
called the styrene
 
02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
information research center they are
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
conducting a study and looking into the
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
science of that to answer that very
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
question because the information that we
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
have thus far over the past several
 
02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
years is just inclusive
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
it is not appropriate for anyone to say
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
yes or no on this topic we do not have
 
02:27:41.910 --> 02:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
enough information and so circ the
 
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
styrene information research center is
 
02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:45.510 align:start position:0%
styrene information research center is
uh

02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
taking steps in order to find some of
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
that information out
 
02:27:51.270 --> 02:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
to the second part of your question
 
02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important for members
 
02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee to understand that
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
styrene itself which is totally separate
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
from polystyrene foam which we drink out
 
02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
of styrene monomer is a naturally
 
02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
occurring substance you will intake
 
02:28:08.469 --> 02:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
styrene every time you eat a strawberry
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
every time you eat steak or beef or have
 
02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:13.510 align:start position:0%
every time you eat steak or beef or have
cinnamon

02:28:13.510 --> 02:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
cinnamon
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
it is a naturally occurring substance
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh when you have people that are going
 
02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
to testify that say that there's a
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
migration between polystyrene and the
 
02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:24.150 align:start position:0%
migration between polystyrene and the
body

02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
body
 
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
they might have had a strawberry that
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
day that would impact those results
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
right and so it's very important to
 
02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
understand that polystyrene foam is an
 
02:28:32.479 --> 02:28:33.510 align:start position:0%
understand that polystyrene foam is an
inert

02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
inert
 
02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:34.469 align:start position:0%
inert
um

02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:36.309 --> 02:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
it's an inert substance
 
02:28:38.469 --> 02:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
like very very little if anything is
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
going to be passing between you
 
02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
and that cup
 
02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
and the evidence that we do have which
 
02:28:46.630 --> 02:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
is called a migration study suggests
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
well far below any threshold that you
 
02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
would be getting from eating naturally
 
02:28:55.030 --> 02:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
occurring food
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question
 
02:28:56.880 --> 02:28:57.750 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question
um

02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
it did didn't give me a warm and fuzzy
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
feeling but thank you
 
02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:03.750 align:start position:0%
feeling but thank you
okay

02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
now thank you mr chairman and uh thank
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
you mr terry uh
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
the question are you familiar with the
 
02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
process of photo degradation and if so
 
02:29:18.150 --> 02:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
could you explain it
 
02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh very broadly representative gretchen
 
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
so i will um
 
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
in the very broadest of terms photo
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
degradation is basically
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
how does a substance break down when it
 
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
is in sunlight
 
02:29:34.469 --> 02:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
and you know how quickly does it break
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
down and um you know
 
02:29:37.439 --> 02:29:38.550 align:start position:0%
down and um you know
how

02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:29:41.349 --> 02:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
how quickly how fast and you know
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
how efficient does it break down in in
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
sunlight um there was a store a study by
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
the woods hole
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's woods often there's a study
 
02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
from a massachusetts institute the woods
 
02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:54.790 align:start position:0%
from a massachusetts institute the woods
hole

02:29:54.790 --> 02:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
hole
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
institute that suggested that
 
02:29:59.670 --> 02:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
in sunlight polystyrene foam
 
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
specifically broke down a lot faster
 
02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:02.950 align:start position:0%
specifically broke down a lot faster
than

02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise known and so what i would do
 
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
is i will forward uh that information to
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
the committee so that you all have that
 
02:30:12.630 --> 02:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
information um and they're still doing
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
some research but the the research that
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
that came out of the study suggested
 
02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:19.750 align:start position:0%
that came out of the study suggested
that

02:30:19.750 --> 02:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
under that photo breakdown basically it
 
02:30:24.389 --> 02:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
was going to break down much much faster
 
02:30:26.710 --> 02:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
than otherwise known or you know
 
02:30:28.630 --> 02:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
previously understood
 
02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
but that's my general understanding i'm
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
definitely not a an expert on it
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you that's all
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative abramson
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i keep thinking of
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
the example of the uh the hot coffee in
 
02:30:46.630 --> 02:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
a polystyrene
 
02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
cup they use polystyrene sometimes as
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
02:30:52.950 --> 02:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
like a thermos like an insulator
 
02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know what the
 
02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
temperature is where uh polystyrene
 
02:30:57.750 --> 02:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
starts releasing chemicals into the
 
02:30:57.760 --> 02:30:59.670 align:start position:0%
starts releasing chemicals into the
beverage

02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
beverage
 
02:31:02.230 --> 02:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
so i'll have to get back to you on that
 
02:31:04.309 --> 02:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
because polystyrene isn't inert
 
02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:08.469 align:start position:0%
because polystyrene isn't inert
uh

02:31:08.469 --> 02:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's an inert material it's not supposed
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
to be releasing chemicals to you at all
 
02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
um and so there's
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure to drive home the
 
02:31:19.830 --> 02:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
fact that styrene monitor the substance
 
02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
that polystyrene foam is made from and
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
the polystyrene foam cup that you're
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
drinking out of they are
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
totally separate they are as separate as
 
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
sugar is from wood right both sugar and
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
wood have cellulose but they're a
 
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
different form
 
02:31:35.670 --> 02:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
and they do different things and so it's
 
02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
very critical to understand that
 
02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
a warm cup a warm coffee and a
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
polystyrene foam cup
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
is not going to transfer
 
02:31:47.110 --> 02:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
styrene into your body
 
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
if anything it would be if you've had
 
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
some cinnamon into the coffee the
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
cinnamon in the coffee might be the
 
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
styrene that might be the trigger to
 
02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
have any type of migration from uh you
 
02:32:00.309 --> 02:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
know the cup to you but the pie starting
 
02:32:03.270 --> 02:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
from cup it's an inert material um the
 
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
migration is not going to really occur
 
02:32:09.030 --> 02:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
at a measurable level that would
 
02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
impact your health
 
02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
there are studies on that migration that
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
are there but to your specific question
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
about at what temperature
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
i'll have to get back to you
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
as to that on the migration study
 
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:32:30.309 --> 02:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
um once again could you give me the name
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
group that you represent
 
02:32:39.670 --> 02:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
the american chemistry council
 
02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
all right and um and who do you
 
02:32:41.680 --> 02:32:43.270 align:start position:0%
all right and um and who do you
represent

02:32:43.270 --> 02:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
so i represent the plastic food service
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
packaging group within the american
 
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
chemistry council so our members are
 
02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
plastic converters and resin producers
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
all right seeing uh no more questions
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
for mr terry thank you very much for
 
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you all for your
 
02:33:07.349 --> 02:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
time and i hope you stay warm yeah thank
 
02:33:07.359 --> 02:33:08.550 align:start position:0%
time and i hope you stay warm yeah thank
you

02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay chair we'll call up john swan
 
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:32.070 --> 02:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay you just have to unmute yourself
 
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone thank you for
 
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony today my name is
 
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
john swann i come from dalton new
 
02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire up in the north
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
country and i am the founder of save
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
forest lake
 
02:33:54.630 --> 02:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's a group um
 
02:33:57.030 --> 02:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
we're in the midst of a landfill battle
 
02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
up in the north country
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
and that's the perspective i bring you
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
today relative to
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
my support for house bill 618
 
02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
we've been involved in this landfill
 
02:34:10.150 --> 02:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
battle to to save force lake and forest
 
02:34:12.389 --> 02:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
lake state park from an encroaching
 
02:34:12.399 --> 02:34:14.230 align:start position:0%
lake state park from an encroaching
landfill

02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
02:34:16.150 --> 02:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
for the past two years and i can tell
 
02:34:17.349 --> 02:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
you that
 
02:34:17.359 --> 02:34:18.630 align:start position:0%
you that
um

02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
polystyrene foam
 
02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:21.510 align:start position:0%
polystyrene foam
is

02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
a product that
 
02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
goes straight to the landfills it's not
 
02:34:28.389 --> 02:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
being recycled
 
02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
um and if you're familiar with the the
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
the waste hierarchy landfilling is
 
02:34:36.309 --> 02:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
obviously at the very bottom of the
 
02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
waste hierarchy
 
02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
so i support house bill 618 and i ask
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
you two as well because this is a step
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the right direction the state of new
 
02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire needs to get serious about
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
our solid waste policies i don't know if
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're aware but the solid waste plan
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
for the state has not been updated since
 
02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
2003 and the state has failed miserably
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
relative to those waste reduction and
 
02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
waste diversion goals
 
02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
so i feel that
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
obviously as a member of society and
 
02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
someone involved in this type of fight
 
02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
we need to get serious about reducing
 
02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
the amount of waste we generate
 
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
as a society so i feel that house bill
 
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
618 is a step in the right direction
 
02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's a product it involves a product
 
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
that goes straight to the landfill and
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
of course if you if you're like me and
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
you like to take walks
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to find
 
02:35:34.230 --> 02:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
styrofoam cups littering the the
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
landscape our scenic landscape so
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and i will say this if anything does
 
02:35:40.790 --> 02:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
come out of this hearing
 
02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
i hope those of you
 
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
who use single-use convenient disposable
 
02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
cups will get away from that and start
 
02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:49.270 align:start position:0%
cups will get away from that and start
using

02:35:49.270 --> 02:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
using
 
02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:50.710 align:start position:0%
using
reusable

02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
reusable
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
hot and cold cups
 
02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
i mean think about it we all have to do
 
02:35:57.349 --> 02:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
our part to reduce what we waste as a
 
02:36:00.230 --> 02:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
society so i ask you to please support
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 618 as ought to pass thank
 
02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:07.280 align:start position:0%

i'm here today to
 
02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
echo um some of representative spang's
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
comments and certainly
 
02:37:27.670 --> 02:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
the actions taken by the legislature
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
last year relative to house bill 1564.
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
1564 was a very similar bill
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
that we worked with representative uh
 
02:37:40.469 --> 02:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
balch on former representative bulge
 
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
um he was the prime sponsor of 1564 and
 
02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
he agreed with us that eggs
 
02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
should be included in the
 
02:37:52.389 --> 02:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
language of the bill and that is how the
 
02:37:55.270 --> 02:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill passed the house last year before
 
02:37:58.389 --> 02:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
being tabled in the senate
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
we're suggesting a couple of amendments
 
02:38:03.270 --> 02:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
this year uh one for eggs
 
02:38:05.349 --> 02:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
and one for
 
02:38:08.070 --> 02:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
um raw produce
 
02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
in correspondence that i sent to you i
 
02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
sent a letter from mr george bradden who
 
02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
is with delco packaging
 
02:38:18.550 --> 02:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
and on the re or second page or reverse
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
side of a page if you printed it out it
 
02:38:23.830 --> 02:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
would have the proposed amendment that
 
02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
we uh are suggesting for the bill
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
02:38:31.270 --> 02:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know raw eggs raw meat raw produce
 
02:38:32.790 --> 02:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
they there's a
 
02:38:35.270 --> 02:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
pretty complex supply chain as they move
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
into your supermarkets um
 
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the throughout the state of
 
02:38:40.230 --> 02:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
um they're often packed in large
 
02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
centralized facilities for reasons of
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
cost and food safety
 
02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:47.910 align:start position:0%
cost and food safety
um

02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:48.950 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:50.710 --> 02:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
you know in in
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
we're asking that eggs be included
 
02:38:55.349 --> 02:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
because while
 
02:38:57.349 --> 02:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative spang's bill does have
 
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
language in there addressing materials
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
this language that we're adding for just
 
02:39:10.870 --> 02:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
eggs in general it would treat all egg
 
02:39:13.830 --> 02:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
and produce production similarly
 
02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
if we did not add that then any
 
02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
production within new hampshire
 
02:39:20.790 --> 02:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
would would be
 
02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:22.309 align:start position:0%
would would be
disadvantaged

02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged
 
02:39:23.830 --> 02:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
versus those
 
02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
shipping eggs or produce into the state
 
02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:29.349 align:start position:0%
shipping eggs or produce into the state
um

02:39:29.349 --> 02:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
we sympathize with the concern over
 
02:39:33.990 --> 02:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
solid waste and environmental impacts of
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
litter they're important issues for
 
02:39:38.790 --> 02:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
all of our municipalities and throughout
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:39:43.510 --> 02:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
but polystyrene foam egg cartons
 
02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
trays for various types of meat and
 
02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
apple flats are not normally found in
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:53.830 --> 02:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
i know i never have and i would imagine
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
that most people that do not buy a
 
02:39:58.150 --> 02:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
carton of eggs and eat the eggs on their
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
way home and toss the carton out the
 
02:40:00.319 --> 02:40:01.590 align:start position:0%
way home and toss the carton out the
window

02:40:01.590 --> 02:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
window
 
02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:02.389 align:start position:0%
window
so

02:40:02.389 --> 02:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:05.190 --> 02:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
to to adhere to interstate commerce
 
02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:06.710 align:start position:0%
to to adhere to interstate commerce
regulations

02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:07.670 align:start position:0%
regulations
um

02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're asking for these amendments we
 
02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
think that they're reasonable they're
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
this house passed last year
 
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
and if the bill is to move forward we
 
02:40:22.790 --> 02:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
would urge you to include that language
 
02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to try and address any
 
02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
questions uh certainly there have been
 
02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
some technical ones that i know i won't
 
02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
be able to answer but i would endeavor
 
02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:32.469 align:start position:0%
be able to answer but i would endeavor
to

02:40:32.469 --> 02:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
find answers for you so thank you very
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%

02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative
 
02:40:42.070 --> 02:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:44.710 --> 02:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question um
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking about my local grocery
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
store they have quite a few items that
 
02:40:50.309 --> 02:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
come in
 
02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
um obviously
 
02:40:54.389 --> 02:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
eggs and whatnot that are brought in
 
02:40:57.270 --> 02:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
that that come in polystyrene
 
02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:58.950 align:start position:0%
that that come in polystyrene
containers

02:40:58.950 --> 02:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
containers
 
02:41:00.790 --> 02:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
but that you also have businesses that
 
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
have some of their food products
 
02:41:05.270 --> 02:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
that are prepared maybe over the line in
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and then sent up to stores
 
02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:09.910 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and then sent up to stores
in

02:41:09.910 --> 02:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire are those businesses going
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
to have to take every single food item
 
02:41:16.630 --> 02:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
from the polystyrene container and
 
02:41:19.510 --> 02:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
transfer them over handling the food
 
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
is there going to be an unintended
 
02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
consequence of of this bill
 
02:41:25.590 --> 02:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative abramson for
 
02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
the question my my understanding my
 
02:41:29.830 --> 02:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
reading of the the language in the bill
 
02:41:31.349 --> 02:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
would be that
 
02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
if that product is arriving at the
 
02:41:36.429 --> 02:41:36.439 align:start position:0%
supermarket in seabrook
 
02:41:36.439 --> 02:41:38.070 align:start position:0%
supermarket in seabrook
pre-packaged

02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
pre-packaged
 
02:41:41.349 --> 02:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh from say massachusetts and it has
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
pack you know polystyrene packaging
 
02:41:44.399 --> 02:41:45.190 align:start position:0%
pack you know polystyrene packaging
then

02:41:45.190 --> 02:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
there would be nothing that the owner of
 
02:41:49.349 --> 02:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
that store would have to or manager of
 
02:41:51.510 --> 02:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
that store would have to do
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
they could sell that product as is
 
02:41:57.110 --> 02:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
but if the you know
 
02:41:59.349 --> 02:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
local farm was producing you know
 
02:42:00.790 --> 02:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
sending apples
 
02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
in a polystyrene tray from
 
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know kensington
 
02:42:08.710 --> 02:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
um that would not be permitted that
 
02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
farmer would be at a disadvantage in
 
02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
terms of the types of materials that
 
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
they could use
 
02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
versus the farmer uh apple farm in
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
amesbury mass
 
02:42:22.469 --> 02:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up
 
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
well yeah just so you know you need to
 
02:42:26.790 --> 02:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
look at the if you look at the bill uh
 
02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
there is sections two and three to three
 
02:42:32.070 --> 02:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
specifically says uh that you do not
 
02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
need to repackage it if it came from out
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
of state right but so do you have a
 
02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
further question or a different question
 
02:42:42.070 --> 02:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
well my my question was about uh what
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
happens in places like starbucks
 
02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
where they
 
02:42:46.950 --> 02:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
to avoid the sales tax they have the
 
02:42:49.270 --> 02:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
food prepared on another
 
02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:50.150 align:start position:0%
food prepared on another
uh

02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
site so they then package
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
sandwiches and prepared foods and then
 
02:42:55.190 --> 02:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
send it
 
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
to a starbucks store so they don't have
 
02:42:58.550 --> 02:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
to pay the meals and rooms tax
 
02:43:01.110 --> 02:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh data so we would have to pay rooms
 
02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
and meals tax if it's rightfully
 
02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
prepared off-site to avoid the tax but
 
02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
then what happens if it comes in
 
02:43:08.070 --> 02:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
polystyrene does this does the does the
 
02:43:09.750 --> 02:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
store or restaurant have to dispose of
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
the food or they have to transfer to a
 
02:43:13.510 --> 02:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
different type of container if the
 
02:43:17.270 --> 02:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
contain if the food was pre-packaged and
 
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
assembled in massachusetts
 
02:43:21.510 --> 02:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
um it could be massachusetts or new
 
02:43:23.349 --> 02:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire once you have the food product
 
02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
there and you notice that it's it's in
 
02:43:27.670 --> 02:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
polystyrene do you then have to trace
 
02:43:29.910 --> 02:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
back where the food came from and if it
 
02:43:31.510 --> 02:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
came from a facility in new hampshire
 
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
you then have to transfer the food into
 
02:43:35.270 --> 02:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
paper or
 
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
some other container the way i read this
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill in its language is that if it was
 
02:43:45.269 --> 02:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
assembled and packaged and produced in
 
02:43:47.110 --> 02:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:43:49.269 --> 02:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
it would have to have
 
02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
raw have to have something raw or
 
02:43:53.190 --> 02:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
uncooked in there which i would think
 
02:43:55.269 --> 02:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
eggs are uncooked so i'm not sure why we
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
if we really do need the egg exception
 
02:43:57.279 --> 02:43:58.070 align:start position:0%
if we really do need the egg exception
but

02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh i certainly don't eat eggs raw except
 
02:44:01.349 --> 02:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:44:04.469 --> 02:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
i guess elvis presley did but um this
 
02:44:06.150 --> 02:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
but it if you have to read the
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
exemptions to to follow uh max but it
 
02:44:12.389 --> 02:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
looks to me that uh it does appear that
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
if they if the prepackaged meal came
 
02:44:16.710 --> 02:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
from massachusetts in that styrofoam
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
container they could leave it and sell
 
02:44:21.429 --> 02:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
it in that but if it was uh made in new
 
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire with that pre that phone uh
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
that would be uh illegal under the
 
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
statute this bill
 
02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay i'm just i am not a lawyer nor do i
 
02:44:31.349 --> 02:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
pretend to be one
 
02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
how you would take you know you have
 
02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
something a polystyrene container in the
 
02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:35.990 align:start position:0%
something a polystyrene container in the
store

02:44:35.990 --> 02:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
store
 
02:44:37.910 --> 02:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
or restaurant how do you figure out
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
where that one specific item came from
 
02:44:41.269 --> 02:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
if you're getting food from two
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
different facilities uh that is multiple
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
facilities so i guess you're questioning
 
02:44:47.830 --> 02:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
the enforceability if you don't know
 
02:44:49.269 --> 02:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
where you know who's going to enforce
 
02:44:51.110 --> 02:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
this and based upon where it comes from
 
02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:51.830 align:start position:0%
this and based upon where it comes from
but

02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
and to that point mr chairman if i may
 
02:44:59.429 --> 02:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
in in comparing uh house bill 1564 to
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
this year's house bill 618
 
02:45:07.269 --> 02:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
1564 last year had a fiscal note
 
02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
relative to the bill it was
 
02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
indeterminable based upon
 
02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:45:15.750 --> 02:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
review by environmental services
 
02:45:17.830 --> 02:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
but they clearly were talking about
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement issues
 
02:45:22.710 --> 02:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
and the need for staff
 
02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
and so i i'm not sure whether that would
 
02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
apply to 618 i sense that it probably
 
02:45:31.349 --> 02:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
would but i would uh leave that for the
 
02:45:34.389 --> 02:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh committee's uh review it dodged the
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
fn didn't it
 
02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:37.030 align:start position:0%
fn didn't it
yeah

02:45:37.030 --> 02:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you very much attorney
 
02:45:43.670 --> 02:45:43.680 align:start position:0%

02:45:45.750 --> 02:45:45.760 align:start position:0%

02:46:32.950 --> 02:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:34.630 --> 02:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you my name is
 
02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
melissa gates and i'm the northeast
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
regional manager and a lobbyist for the
 
02:46:40.630 --> 02:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
surfrider foundation and the ocean
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
speaking today
 
02:46:43.830 --> 02:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our new hampshire chapter
 
02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
in strong support of this bill and if
 
02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's any doubt about the
 
02:46:49.910 --> 02:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
recyclability of foam food wear i'd
 
02:46:51.990 --> 02:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
direct your attentions to the lawsuit
 
02:46:54.230 --> 02:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
that dart container corporation which is
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
the biggest phone footwear manufacturer
 
02:46:59.269 --> 02:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
in the u.s has put considerable time and
 
02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
funding into to try to prove their
 
02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
argument that
 
02:47:04.830 --> 02:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
expanded polystyrene foam food wear is
 
02:47:07.030 --> 02:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
recyclable and the american chemistry
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
council actually spent over eight
 
02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars on this as well
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
in support of the new york city
 
02:47:14.230 --> 02:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
restaurant action alliance
 
02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
which rallied against new york city's
 
02:47:18.070 --> 02:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
foam food ware ban and later filed a
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against new york city for that
 
02:47:22.389 --> 02:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
foam food wear ban claiming that the
 
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
material shouldn't be banned because
 
02:47:27.190 --> 02:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's recyclable however both of those
 
02:47:29.429 --> 02:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
failed and new york city's department of
 
02:47:31.630 --> 02:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
sanitation issued a determination on the
 
02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:33.190 align:start position:0%
sanitation issued a determination on the
recyclability

02:47:33.190 --> 02:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
recyclability
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
that it is in fact not recyclable and
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
the court upheld this determination in
 
02:47:41.269 --> 02:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
new york city won their lawsuit because

stipulates to hundreds of years for eps

to photodegrade as opposed to the

previously thought thousands of years

and of course the styrene that we're
 
02:48:00.150 --> 02:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
referring to here is synthetically
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%

styrene
 
02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
in this foam stuff i mean it is just

pervasive and it's consistently one of

the gulf of maine waters averages three
 
02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
pieces of microplastics so we know that
 
02:48:29.110 --> 02:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
plastic pollution is a problem
 
02:48:31.110 --> 02:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
significant human health concerns from
 
02:48:33.190 --> 02:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
the use of foam food wears are seated in
 
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
proven scientific foundations and are
 
02:48:37.349 --> 02:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
cited in the written testimony i
 
02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
submitted to this committee friday we
 
02:48:42.309 --> 02:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
know that toxic components from foam
 
02:48:44.150 --> 02:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
leach into food and drink and that heat
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
is a factor but it's not the only factor
 
02:48:49.830 --> 02:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
alcohol and acidity also come into play
 
02:48:51.429 --> 02:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
which means that when you drink coffee
 
02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
or alcohol whether it's cold or hot or
 
02:48:56.389 --> 02:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
you eat hot or greasy food out of a foam
 
02:48:58.469 --> 02:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
container that you are in fact ingesting
 
02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
toxins at a level that the world's
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
leading health experts tell us probably
 
02:49:06.389 --> 02:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
causes cancer this alone really warrants
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
government intervention to protect human
 
02:49:11.349 --> 02:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
health by passing laws to ban this toxic
 
02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
food wear but then we can also add in
 
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
the pervasive environmental concerns
 
02:49:17.830 --> 02:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
including that this bio accumulating
 
02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
toxin entering our waterways through
 
02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
intentional and non-intentional
 
02:49:23.510 --> 02:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
littering leaching carcinogens into the
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
water being mistaken for food and
 
02:49:28.630 --> 02:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
ingested by aquatic wildlife that some
 
02:49:30.710 --> 02:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
humans then ingest
 
02:49:32.950 --> 02:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
further adding in that foam is wreaking
 
02:49:35.269 --> 02:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
havoc in our landfills and incinerators
 
02:49:37.990 --> 02:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
where it ends up because foam food wears
 
02:49:40.550 --> 02:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
cannot be recycled and add that this
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
material is so lightweight that it
 
02:49:44.230 --> 02:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
easily crumbles and flies all over the
 
02:49:46.870 --> 02:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
place with its non-biodegradable plastic
 
02:49:48.790 --> 02:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
nuisance that will be with us for
 
02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of years we can
 
02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:51.830 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of years we can
see

02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:49:53.830 --> 02:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
very clearly why state after state is
 
02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
passing regulation to ban this stuff
 
02:49:58.150 --> 02:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
even during a global pandemic
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
multiple jurisdictions across the u.s
 
02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
and the world are banning foam food wear
 
02:50:04.389 --> 02:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
and allowing foam bands to come into
 
02:50:05.830 --> 02:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
effect right in the middle of this
 
02:50:08.469 --> 02:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
pandemic which indicates the severity of
 
02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
the issue and some restaurants are
 
02:50:12.630 --> 02:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
shifting away from single-use plastics
 
02:50:15.030 --> 02:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
which is awesome and some consumers are
 
02:50:16.550 --> 02:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
doing that as well but the rate of
 
02:50:19.269 --> 02:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
voluntary compliance just isn't enough
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
and what's more we know that the
 
02:50:23.710 --> 02:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
petrochemical plants that make foam are
 
02:50:25.349 --> 02:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
disproportionately situated in
 
02:50:27.670 --> 02:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
communities of color making black and
 
02:50:29.670 --> 02:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
brown people who live near these plants
 
02:50:31.990 --> 02:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
outside of new hampshire sick so that
 
02:50:34.150 --> 02:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire businesses can continue to
 
02:50:36.469 --> 02:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
use foam food wares which are then
 
02:50:38.309 --> 02:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
literally choking the life out of our
 
02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
watershed while exposing us all the
 
02:50:43.510 --> 02:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
cancer-causing toxins that many people
 
02:50:45.830 --> 02:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
mistakingly assume are safe because
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
they're not banned by the state
 
02:50:49.590 --> 02:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
government i hope you'll agree that it's
 
02:50:51.429 --> 02:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
time to take action by favorably
 
02:50:53.349 --> 02:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
advancing this bill just like the states
 
02:50:55.910 --> 02:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
of vermont maine maryland new york new
 
02:50:58.710 --> 02:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
jersey all counties of hawaii have done
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
to ban this stuff and all of our
 
02:51:03.030 --> 02:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
adjacent states without current foam
 
02:51:05.349 --> 02:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
bands including mass rhode island and
 
02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
connecticut all have active legislation
 
02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:09.190 align:start position:0%
connecticut all have active legislation
advancing

02:51:09.190 --> 02:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
advancing
 
02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
many of which would have passed in the
 
02:51:13.510 --> 02:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
last session but not for covid
 
02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
and we also have multiple local laws
 
02:51:17.590 --> 02:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
banning foam food ware products across
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
all those states that don't currently
 
02:51:22.309 --> 02:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
have active state legislation or state
 
02:51:24.469 --> 02:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
law rather banning the product
 
02:51:26.710 --> 02:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate your time
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
and consideration of this bill and i
 
02:51:30.469 --> 02:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
hope that you'll vote it favorably
 
02:51:30.479 --> 02:51:33.190 align:start position:0%
hope that you'll vote it favorably
forward

02:51:33.190 --> 02:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:51:35.670 --> 02:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much uh any
 
02:51:37.590 --> 02:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members no
 
02:51:40.389 --> 02:51:40.399 align:start position:0%
i don't see any so thank you
 
02:51:45.030 --> 02:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll now invite uh henry veyu who
 
02:51:47.190 --> 02:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
did appear
 
02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:48.150 align:start position:0%
did appear
yes

02:51:48.150 --> 02:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
02:51:51.349 --> 02:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
committee for the record
 
02:51:53.269 --> 02:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
my name is henry value and i'm here on
 
02:51:55.349 --> 02:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new hampshire
 
02:51:58.710 --> 02:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
lodging and restaurant association um
 
02:52:00.550 --> 02:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
and i just say that uh you know the
 
02:52:04.389 --> 02:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
restaurant members aren't tone deaf
 
02:52:07.590 --> 02:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think uh they know that uh
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
folks want uh restaurants to move on to
 
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
environmentally friendly
 
02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:13.429 align:start position:0%
environmentally friendly
uh

02:52:13.429 --> 02:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:13.439 --> 02:52:14.790 align:start position:0%
uh
products

02:52:14.790 --> 02:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
products
 
02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
and some restaurants have already made
 
02:52:17.830 --> 02:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
that step
 
02:52:19.269 --> 02:52:19.279 align:start position:0%
if you've been to a common man
 
02:52:19.279 --> 02:52:20.550 align:start position:0%
if you've been to a common man
restaurant

02:52:20.550 --> 02:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
02:52:21.910 --> 02:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know they already do the paper
 
02:52:24.150 --> 02:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
straws they've gone
 
02:52:26.790 --> 02:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
totally comprehensive
 
02:52:29.110 --> 02:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
other restaurants aren't able to do all
 
02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
that yet uh and some of it does come
 
02:52:33.429 --> 02:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
down to cost uh
 
02:52:35.830 --> 02:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
you look at the alternatives um
 
02:52:37.510 --> 02:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know some can be
 
02:52:39.269 --> 02:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
six cents uh
 
02:52:42.790 --> 02:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
per unit uh difference in price um so it
 
02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
does have a you know a cost impact
 
02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:46.550 align:start position:0%
does have a you know a cost impact
um

02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
so i think the difference between the
 
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
proponents of this legislation in the
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
industry i think is
 
02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh the pace
 
02:52:57.429 --> 02:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
at which the change is going to happen
 
02:52:59.750 --> 02:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh the proponents of this bill
 
02:53:03.670 --> 02:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
have july 1 2022 as a drop dead date
 
02:53:06.070 --> 02:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's gonna move over
 
02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:07.030 align:start position:0%
everybody's gonna move over
um

02:53:07.030 --> 02:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:09.990 --> 02:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
which is ten months away uh and if you
 
02:53:12.070 --> 02:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
think about restaurants right now and
 
02:53:13.429 --> 02:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
some of them hanging on by their
 
02:53:13.439 --> 02:53:14.790 align:start position:0%
some of them hanging on by their
fingertips

02:53:14.790 --> 02:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
fingertips
 
02:53:17.349 --> 02:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh and take out being basically the
 
02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
thing that's keeping them alive
 
02:53:19.520 --> 02:53:20.550 align:start position:0%
thing that's keeping them alive
uh

02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:53:21.990 --> 02:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
many of which never thought they'd be
 
02:53:25.269 --> 02:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
doing this much take out prior to covet
 
02:53:27.510 --> 02:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
so right now you know their whole cost
 
02:53:31.030 --> 02:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
structure has just changed dramatically
 
02:53:32.790 --> 02:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh with covid
 
02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
02:53:36.550 --> 02:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
so i think the timing of this right now
 
02:53:38.710 --> 02:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
particularly saying 10 months from now
 
02:53:41.030 --> 02:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
everybody's got to change over uh when
 
02:53:42.230 --> 02:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
they're just trying to figure out how
 
02:53:43.590 --> 02:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to get through
 
02:53:46.309 --> 02:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
you know the rest of the spring uh
 
02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
is summer going to be back to somewhat
 
02:53:49.670 --> 02:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
normal you know with the new strains
 
02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
coming on are we still going gonna have
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
the protocols in place are people still
 
02:53:55.830 --> 02:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
are people gonna want to go to
 
02:53:55.840 --> 02:53:57.030 align:start position:0%
are people gonna want to go to
restaurants

02:53:57.030 --> 02:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
02:53:58.950 --> 02:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
and so i think the
 
02:54:02.389 --> 02:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
the timing of it right now just uh uh
 
02:54:04.389 --> 02:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
you know is a challenge for a lot of
 
02:54:05.910 --> 02:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants that have been thinking
 
02:54:08.150 --> 02:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
about it but want to make sure there's
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
buy-in from their
 
02:54:11.830 --> 02:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
patron community that it's going to cost
 
02:54:13.510 --> 02:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
a little more i think people that go to
 
02:54:16.309 --> 02:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
common man recognize okay we're making
 
02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know investment in our environment
 
02:54:22.389 --> 02:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
and they're happy uh you know to uh to
 
02:54:25.110 --> 02:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
pay the extra cost um so
 
02:54:27.269 --> 02:54:27.279 align:start position:0%
again we're not tone deaf i think it's
 
02:54:28.790 --> 02:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
just the pace at which the change is
 
02:54:30.309 --> 02:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
going to occur that's where the
 
02:54:32.550 --> 02:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
difference allies and we would argue
 
02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:33.429 align:start position:0%
difference allies and we would argue
that

02:54:33.429 --> 02:54:33.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:36.150 --> 02:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
this bill saying 10 months from now
 
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to switch over
 
02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
when they're all just trying to
 
02:54:41.910 --> 02:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
hang on by their fingernails makes it
 
02:54:44.710 --> 02:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
difficult so with that i'm happy to
 
02:54:46.550 --> 02:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
answer any questions okay thank you uh
 
02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
we do have a couple of questions
 
02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
02:54:51.750 --> 02:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair
 
02:54:54.870 --> 02:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
so um mr value then we can um we would
 
02:54:57.269 --> 02:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
able to count on your support if we made
 
02:55:00.469 --> 02:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
this july 1st of 2022
 
02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
is that correct if you could retain the
 
02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:04.230 align:start position:0%
is that correct if you could retain the
bill

02:55:04.230 --> 02:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
okay no that wasn't the question i asked
 
02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:07.429 align:start position:0%
okay no that wasn't the question i asked
you

02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:55:07.439 --> 02:55:09.269 align:start position:0%
you
um

02:55:09.269 --> 02:55:09.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
again i we don't know when you know
 
02:55:14.790 --> 02:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
i'd love to know when business is gonna
 
02:55:16.550 --> 02:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
be back to normal and that was one of
 
02:55:17.990 --> 02:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
the things uh mike's always talking to
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
mike summers who's the president of the
 
02:55:21.269 --> 02:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
association you know even when we come
 
02:55:22.870 --> 02:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
out of this i think there's still going
 
02:55:25.429 --> 02:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
to be some lag time uh when people are
 
02:55:27.429 --> 02:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
going to be so used to taking out
 
02:55:27.439 --> 02:55:28.389 align:start position:0%
going to be so used to taking out
uh

02:55:28.389 --> 02:55:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:55:28.399 --> 02:55:29.190 align:start position:0%
uh
so

02:55:29.190 --> 02:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:31.030 --> 02:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
i i would prefer the committee retain
 
02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:55:34.790 --> 02:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
ask a follow-up further question may
 
02:55:36.870 --> 02:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you mr chair
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
so if we retain the bill and we change
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
the date
 
02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:41.750 align:start position:0%
the date
to

02:55:41.750 --> 02:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
july 1st of 2022
 
02:55:47.429 --> 02:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
could we count on
 
02:55:49.030 --> 02:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire restaurant and lodging
 
02:55:53.030 --> 02:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
association to support this action
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
i think the association would prefer
 
02:55:57.190 --> 02:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
that the members can do it at their pace
 
02:55:58.870 --> 02:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
and again i think a lot of restaurants
 
02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
have already
 
02:56:03.269 --> 02:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
moved over uh to other alternatives
 
02:56:03.279 --> 02:56:04.469 align:start position:0%
moved over uh to other alternatives
um

02:56:04.469 --> 02:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:07.750 --> 02:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
and um i think you know we'll get there
 
02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:08.630 align:start position:0%
and um i think you know we'll get there
um

02:56:08.630 --> 02:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
it's the hard fast date i think that
 
02:56:13.990 --> 02:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
so that would be a no
 
02:56:16.230 --> 02:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's i guess that's correct yeah okay
 
02:56:19.030 --> 02:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:56:21.670 --> 02:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
the other questions from the committee
 
02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:22.790 align:start position:0%
the other questions from the committee
members

02:56:22.790 --> 02:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh seeing them uh thank you very much
 
02:56:26.550 --> 02:56:26.560 align:start position:0%

02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:28.230 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
and

02:56:28.230 --> 02:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:31.349 --> 02:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
i see no hands up
 
02:56:33.830 --> 02:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know i had more people who said they
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak but i guess no that's
 
02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
not that bad
 
02:56:39.830 --> 02:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:56:43.110 --> 02:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's 11 57 unbelievable okay
 
02:56:45.830 --> 02:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
so we will close the public hearing on
 
02:56:49.990 --> 02:56:50.000 align:start position:0%

02:56:58.630 --> 02:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
being neutral
 
02:57:02.309 --> 02:57:02.319 align:start position:0%

04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
roll lay down on his back and he refused
 
04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
to move
 
04:25:50.800 --> 04:25:52.229 align:start position:0%
to move

04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
mine wanted to stay out in a puddle
 
04:25:58.389 --> 04:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
puddles yeah puppies puppies love metals
 
04:26:00.950 --> 04:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely loves puddles loves snow up
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
to her ears she bounces around in it
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's a marvel yeah
 
04:26:09.110 --> 04:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
well it is invigorating to go out with a
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
puppy for a walk it really is it's not
 
04:26:13.910 --> 04:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
like me strolling the neighborhood it uh
 
04:26:15.750 --> 04:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
keeps me alert well you know we're
 
04:26:17.429 --> 04:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
having trouble getting ours to heal
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
she's she wants to want the alpha and
 
04:26:23.670 --> 04:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
run forward run run ahead and
 
04:26:26.469 --> 04:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
so so we're trying to train it to to
 
04:26:28.149 --> 04:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
heal you know put we have a little leash
 
04:26:29.990 --> 04:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
tight leash and keep saying he'll he'll
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
give her the treat when she does but
 
04:26:33.990 --> 04:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's been been a challenge
 
04:26:35.429 --> 04:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
you know john i'm working on something
 
04:26:36.870 --> 04:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
like that with my pup and of course
 
04:26:38.950 --> 04:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
she's little so she's not getting it but
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
what what i'm doing is i just put my
 
04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
finger down at my side where i want her
 
04:26:45.429 --> 04:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
to be and i walk like that
 
04:26:47.590 --> 04:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
and if i speed up or slow down she does
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
04:26:50.550 --> 04:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
the only thing is distractibility so if
 
04:26:53.189 --> 04:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
a squirrel goes by my finger is like
 
04:26:53.199 --> 04:26:55.030 align:start position:0%
a squirrel goes by my finger is like
lost

04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
lost
 
04:26:57.030 --> 04:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
but she does heal and i use the word
 
04:26:59.110 --> 04:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
walk but if my finger's down and there's
 
04:27:01.349 --> 04:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
no distraction she will walk so i'm
 
04:27:03.030 --> 04:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
figuring it out
 
04:27:06.229 --> 04:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
try pointing yeah yeah uh she sees it as
 
04:27:07.590 --> 04:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
and i have to tell the first to look at
 
04:27:09.590 --> 04:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
me so i hold the treat up here oh okay
 
04:27:11.110 --> 04:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
yeah you
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
and then got the treat
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
treat in this hand and my finger down
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
and she's she's catching on that's good
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
or she's not catching on to anything
 
04:27:19.349 --> 04:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
else but you know
 
04:27:21.030 --> 04:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
pick your battles
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
that's a good one to start with
 
04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
what kind of dog john
 
04:27:29.110 --> 04:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
so we have a black lab
 
04:27:31.590 --> 04:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
and we we have um we have another black
 
04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
lab who's 14 years old
 
04:27:37.590 --> 04:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
and so this is sort of minnie me
 
04:27:39.750 --> 04:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh different different breeder and
 
04:27:42.070 --> 04:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
everything but but uh she they look very
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
very similar and
 
04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
very adorable
 
04:27:47.670 --> 04:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
i love labs
 
04:27:49.269 --> 04:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
and they are very faithful and honest
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
and they don't run away too much like my
 
04:27:53.110 --> 04:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
beagles used to do i i used to have
 
04:27:54.389 --> 04:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
beagles and
 
04:27:56.149 --> 04:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
i had a beagle they're they're a
 
04:27:58.389 --> 04:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
nightmare sometimes and they're very
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
cute and they're puppies but uh
 
04:28:04.070 --> 04:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
but when you can hear one howling around
 
04:28:07.510 --> 04:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:10.870 --> 04:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:10.880 --> 04:28:12.630 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:28:14.469 --> 04:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
well that was not my best morning in
 
04:28:16.389 --> 04:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
terms of moving things along other than
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
timing timing was good we could get
 
04:28:21.110 --> 04:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
through there but timing was good but
 
04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.429 --> 04:28:29.439 align:start position:0%

04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
my clerk i am on i just have one thing
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
to interject if i if i could
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
one of the speakers from last session uh
 
04:30:09.269 --> 04:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
called me during the break melissa gates
 
04:30:11.269 --> 04:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
04:30:13.110 --> 04:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
the surfers association
 
04:30:15.269 --> 04:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
she said people had signed up and they
 
04:30:18.070 --> 04:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
were expecting to be called to speak but
 
04:30:19.910 --> 04:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh maybe you were relying on the hands
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
going up and they weren't able to put
 
04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
hands up yeah so yeah no i got there was
 
04:30:27.110 --> 04:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
one person at the end there that she
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
that wanted to uh um that i missed but i
 
04:30:31.990 --> 04:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
apologize to her
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
but i i guess i didn't say ray's hands
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
or i guess i i
 
04:30:37.349 --> 04:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
i guess i was so marveled by the fact
 
04:30:39.030 --> 04:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
that we were right on time and no hands
 
04:30:40.389 --> 04:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
were raised
 
04:30:41.750 --> 04:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's just a learning curve for
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
the zoom thing
 
04:30:46.469 --> 04:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
yeah for for people but for everybody i
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
got it yeah
 
04:30:49.110 --> 04:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
emphasize the importance of raising
 
04:30:49.120 --> 04:30:49.990 align:start position:0%
emphasize the importance of raising
hands

04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
hands
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%

that's specifically rsa 375 a and it is

have a certificate of need
 
04:31:29.279 --> 04:31:30.389 align:start position:0%

04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
the reason i call this statute
 
04:31:55.189 --> 04:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
certificate of need statute is um
 
04:31:55.199 --> 04:31:56.229 align:start position:0%
certificate of need statute is um
is

04:31:56.229 --> 04:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:31:56.239 --> 04:31:57.590 align:start position:0%
is
the

04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:03.030 --> 04:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:07.510 --> 04:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
which states that a proposed service
 
04:32:09.189 --> 04:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
is required or
 
04:32:11.830 --> 04:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
or will be required by the present or
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
future public convenience and necessary
 
04:32:15.600 --> 04:32:17.510 align:start position:0%
future public convenience and necessary
necessity

04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
necessity
 
04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise such applications should be
 
04:32:19.279 --> 04:32:20.790 align:start position:0%
otherwise such applications should be
denied

04:32:20.790 --> 04:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
denied
 
04:32:22.229 --> 04:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
there is a question uh
 
04:32:26.790 --> 04:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
in my mind of why we are requiring them
 
04:32:27.910 --> 04:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
to prove
 
04:32:29.830 --> 04:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
that there is going to be a future
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
public convenience and necessity before
 
04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to go into business also
 
04:32:34.880 --> 04:32:36.229 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to go into business also
um

04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:37.830 --> 04:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
in my research i found that there is
 
04:32:39.990 --> 04:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
only about 34
 
04:32:40.000 --> 04:32:41.110 align:start position:0%
only about 34
companies

04:32:41.110 --> 04:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
companies
 
04:32:42.550 --> 04:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
moving companies that fall into the
 
04:32:45.670 --> 04:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
requirements of this chapter and both
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
maine and vermont do not regulate
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
household movers
 
04:32:52.389 --> 04:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
and uh while the department of safety
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
said that they receive about one to two
 
04:32:55.990 --> 04:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
complaints a year
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
most of which are resolved with just a
 
04:33:01.349 --> 04:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
phone call um i was not able to find any
 
04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
like rogue
 
04:33:03.760 --> 04:33:05.029 align:start position:0%
like rogue
movers

04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
movers
 
04:33:07.750 --> 04:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
causing a problem in maine and vermont
 
04:33:10.150 --> 04:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
via my internet searches to
 
04:33:11.429 --> 04:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
see if that
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
that we are really stopping uh
 
04:33:18.310 --> 04:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:21.910 --> 04:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
problems by having this uh statute here
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
i think that it uh just
 
04:33:26.709 --> 04:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
creates a barrier to entry for these
 
04:33:29.590 --> 04:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
people having to prove that they um you
 
04:33:32.230 --> 04:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.709 --> 04:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
future public convenience and necessity
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
especially when they're competing with
 
04:33:39.029 --> 04:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
national chains et cetera et cetera
 
04:33:41.910 --> 04:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to bring this to the
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
attention of the committee and i hope
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
that you would um
 
04:33:47.349 --> 04:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
support the bill and i'm happy to answer
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:33:53.109 --> 04:33:53.119 align:start position:0%
so why do you want to repeal it
 
04:33:55.349 --> 04:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
because it's a certificate of need
 
04:33:56.949 --> 04:33:56.959 align:start position:0%
that they have to prove that
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
i hate to say this but using that term
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
certificate of need for those of us in
 
04:34:03.510 --> 04:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature a long time
 
04:34:06.390 --> 04:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
has a huge implication certificate of
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
need is something we required of all
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
hospitals to prove right why they added
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
needed facilities so using that term is
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
a little stretch so
 
04:34:18.551 --> 04:34:18.561 align:start position:0%
so you're you're simply saying it's this
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
statute's not needed is that the purpose
 
04:34:23.189 --> 04:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
and you're saying well it's not really
 
04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
needed it's not
 
04:34:26.789 --> 04:34:26.799 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question i mean
 
04:34:28.390 --> 04:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that it's not needed
 
04:34:29.670 --> 04:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
because i don't
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
other states don't have it and they
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
don't have an issue with not having it
 
04:34:35.590 --> 04:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
but also i think it's a barrier to entry
 
04:34:36.869 --> 04:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
to require
 
04:34:38.789 --> 04:34:38.799 align:start position:0%
the um people
 
04:34:41.670 --> 04:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
seeking the certificate of need to prove
 
04:34:41.680 --> 04:34:42.789 align:start position:0%
seeking the certificate of need to prove
that

04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
their business is required by present or
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
future public convenience and necessity
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
listed in the statute otherwise their
 
04:34:55.109 --> 04:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
application for the certificate would be
 
04:34:57.990 --> 04:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
denied so that is my issue with this
 
04:34:58.000 --> 04:34:59.990 align:start position:0%
denied so that is my issue with this
statute

04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
at its root yeah thank you
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative van halton
 
04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%

representative yokola
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
i must admit i did some research on this
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
last night to not much avail and i'm
 
04:35:17.189 --> 04:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
still not sure from your explanation
 
04:35:19.189 --> 04:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
what the certificate of need is here
 
04:35:20.789 --> 04:35:20.799 align:start position:0%
you're talking about movers mover
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
company moving companies
 
04:35:24.551 --> 04:35:24.561 align:start position:0%
at present under this statute do they
 
04:35:26.070 --> 04:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
have to prove that there is a need for
 
04:35:28.869 --> 04:35:28.879 align:start position:0%
their service or maybe i should just rot
 
04:35:30.789 --> 04:35:30.799 align:start position:0%
more broadly would you elaborate on what
 
04:35:33.189 --> 04:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
you mean please okay thank you for the
 
04:35:36.949 --> 04:35:36.959 align:start position:0%
question um i would point you to um the
 
04:35:39.670 --> 04:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
last sentence of rsa
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%

04:35:45.910 --> 04:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
so that is what is guiding whether or
 
04:35:45.920 --> 04:35:46.869 align:start position:0%
so that is what is guiding whether or
not

04:35:46.869 --> 04:35:46.879 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
these certificates shall be
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
issued and in that requirement
 
04:35:52.160 --> 04:35:53.830 align:start position:0%
issued and in that requirement
um

04:35:53.830 --> 04:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:55.990 --> 04:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
as i've i've alluded to and and
 
04:35:59.830 --> 04:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
reference a few times there is a
 
04:36:01.990 --> 04:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
a requirement
 
04:36:02.000 --> 04:36:02.949 align:start position:0%
a requirement
that

04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:02.959 --> 04:36:04.551 align:start position:0%
that
the

04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:07.510 --> 04:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
there only be a certificate issued
 
04:36:07.520 --> 04:36:08.629 align:start position:0%
there only be a certificate issued
when

04:36:08.629 --> 04:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:36:11.109 --> 04:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
the commissioner um
 
04:36:11.119 --> 04:36:12.551 align:start position:0%
the commissioner um
decides

04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
decides
 
04:36:12.561 --> 04:36:14.310 align:start position:0%
decides
or

04:36:14.310 --> 04:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:36:17.830 --> 04:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
concludes that the proposed service that
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
these people are trying to provide
 
04:36:19.920 --> 04:36:20.949 align:start position:0%
these people are trying to provide
is

04:36:20.949 --> 04:36:20.959 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:36:23.189 --> 04:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
or will be required
 
04:36:25.750 --> 04:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
by the present or future public
 
04:36:29.349 --> 04:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
convenience and necessity
 
04:36:33.510 --> 04:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise the commissioner uh
 
04:36:37.990 --> 04:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:39.910 --> 04:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
follow up please okay for the question
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
we inquire um thank you
 
04:36:42.080 --> 04:36:43.670 align:start position:0%
we inquire um thank you
so

04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:46.070 --> 04:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
according to the statute as it exists
 
04:36:47.750 --> 04:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
the statute that you want this section
 
04:36:49.510 --> 04:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
repealed from
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
yes it's possible that there's no need
 
04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
for movers
 
04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
is that the intent of the step perhaps
 
04:36:55.520 --> 04:36:56.789 align:start position:0%
is that the intent of the step perhaps
i'm

04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:36:58.949 --> 04:36:58.959 align:start position:0%
so here's what i did i just
 
04:37:00.869 --> 04:37:00.879 align:start position:0%
i just promoted up we do have someone
 
04:37:02.869 --> 04:37:02.879 align:start position:0%
from the department of transportation
 
04:37:04.869 --> 04:37:04.879 align:start position:0%
and i realized that there you have a
 
04:37:06.470 --> 04:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
question and representative west have a
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
question but maybe we should hear from
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
him and have him explain to us
 
04:37:13.590 --> 04:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
how they're treating that stat that
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
phrase that statute and whether they
 
04:37:15.680 --> 04:37:16.629 align:start position:0%
phrase that statute and whether they
really

04:37:16.629 --> 04:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:37:19.349 --> 04:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
are you guys okay with having having so
 
04:37:20.949 --> 04:37:20.959 align:start position:0%
uh josh would you stick around in case
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know we might have some more
 
04:37:24.310 --> 04:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
questions for you but but absolutely
 
04:37:26.789 --> 04:37:26.799 align:start position:0%
i think what i'd like to do is bring up
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
eric marshall who can maybe um
 
04:37:32.150 --> 04:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
explain to us uh is there is it really
 
04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
true that you
 
04:37:34.320 --> 04:37:35.269 align:start position:0%
true that you
we

04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
that you could reject someone because he
 
04:37:39.029 --> 04:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
couldn't really prove why
 
04:37:40.830 --> 04:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
we needed this
 
04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
mover uh hello my name is eric marshall
 
04:37:45.269 --> 04:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
i'm from department of safety road toll
 
04:37:47.109 --> 04:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
bureau uh yeah we can they have to go
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
through a hearing
 
04:37:51.349 --> 04:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay uh really the hearings uh office
 
04:37:53.429 --> 04:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
that decides whether they can be
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
rejected but
 
04:37:56.709 --> 04:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
i can't recall everyone ever being
 
04:37:58.230 --> 04:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
rejected in the 10 years that i've been
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
in this position so
 
04:38:02.789 --> 04:38:02.799 align:start position:0%
um yes they can be rejected but have i
 
04:38:05.510 --> 04:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
ever witnessed one no
 
04:38:05.520 --> 04:38:06.551 align:start position:0%
ever witnessed one no
so

04:38:06.551 --> 04:38:06.561 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:08.709 --> 04:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
all right so so maybe that element of
 
04:38:12.789 --> 04:38:12.799 align:start position:0%
the statue is is a little old and
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
archaic i guess
 
04:38:18.390 --> 04:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
um but is it is there uh what is the
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
compelling safety issue for the state to
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
to regulate
 
04:38:24.869 --> 04:38:24.879 align:start position:0%
these drivers
 
04:38:26.869 --> 04:38:26.879 align:start position:0%
relate these uh regulate these moving
 
04:38:26.879 --> 04:38:27.990 align:start position:0%
relate these uh regulate these moving
companies

04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
companies
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
um i would i can't i wouldn't be able to
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
answer that right now but i can get you
 
04:38:34.629 --> 04:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
an answer to that uh
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
mostly uh through uh our troop g is the
 
04:38:39.750 --> 04:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
one who does the enforcement on it and
 
04:38:41.109 --> 04:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
i'd have to know if they've ever had any
 
04:38:44.470 --> 04:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
safety issues so i could ask them
 
04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
other than that i i don't recall
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
hearing anything any safety issues we
 
04:38:51.439 --> 04:38:52.949 align:start position:0%
hearing anything any safety issues we
regulate

04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
04:38:52.959 --> 04:38:54.070 align:start position:0%
regulate
uh

04:38:54.070 --> 04:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:56.310 --> 04:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know they have to submit tariffs and
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
their rates and stuff like that so
 
04:39:00.310 --> 04:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
really that's what we monitor
 
04:39:03.029 --> 04:39:03.039 align:start position:0%
um so as far as safety is concerned with
 
04:39:04.789 --> 04:39:04.799 align:start position:0%
their vehicles and
 
04:39:06.629 --> 04:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
and uh things like that we we don't do
 
04:39:09.189 --> 04:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
that in our in our section troop g does
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
that so but the safety would be they
 
04:39:13.670 --> 04:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
would they're just like any truck that's
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
running around in new hampshire you know
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
exactly yes you don't treat them
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
differently okay
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
all right so connie uh representative
 
04:39:24.390 --> 04:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
van halen do you want to pursue your
 
04:39:26.551 --> 04:39:26.561 align:start position:0%
question no no i i think it's been
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
clarified i'm just um stunned that this
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%
type of thing exists
 
04:39:32.709 --> 04:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
for movers and apparently not for a
 
04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
great deal of other other people so uh
 
04:39:36.551 --> 04:39:36.561 align:start position:0%
no thank you and thank you john for
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
helping to clarify as well as a
 
04:39:38.080 --> 04:39:39.190 align:start position:0%
helping to clarify as well as a
representative

04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:39:41.110 --> 04:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
my assumption is that when you have
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
federal regulating for for
 
04:39:46.868 --> 04:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
um interstate commerce that somebody
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
thought somewhere along the line thought
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
it was probably appropriate to make sure
 
04:39:52.070 --> 04:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
that in-state
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
was it was had a parallel law you know
 
04:39:56.948 --> 04:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
much much like the same thing we had
 
04:39:58.150 --> 04:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
04:40:00.310 --> 04:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
with food safety uh representative
 
04:40:00.320 --> 04:40:09.910 align:start position:0%
with food safety uh representative
bartlett

04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
you there you got it
 
04:40:14.628 --> 04:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
oh you just there you go there sorry
 
04:40:17.750 --> 04:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
um phone range just as you're calling me
 
04:40:17.760 --> 04:40:20.310 align:start position:0%
um phone range just as you're calling me
um

04:40:20.310 --> 04:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:20.320 --> 04:40:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
confused i guess
 
04:40:23.440 --> 04:40:25.270 align:start position:0%
confused i guess
um

04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
so there's no one from the state that
 
04:40:29.350 --> 04:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
tells us why we have to have this other
 
04:40:31.830 --> 04:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
states don't have it are we the
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative we the only state that
 
04:40:38.470 --> 04:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um actually
 
04:40:41.830 --> 04:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
no we
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
so there are
 
04:40:46.150 --> 04:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
um 46
 
04:40:46.160 --> 04:40:47.430 align:start position:0%
um 46
states

04:40:47.430 --> 04:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
or 40 40
 
04:40:51.990 --> 04:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
42 44 states so there are six states
 
04:40:54.948 --> 04:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
that do not have it um of those states
 
04:40:57.510 --> 04:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
we are boarded by two of them um also
 
04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
alaska delaware utah and wisconsin don't
 
04:41:04.708 --> 04:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
have the these um types of regulations
 
04:41:07.670 --> 04:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
they don't regulate them at a um at all
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:41:09.360 --> 04:41:10.310 align:start position:0%
but um
there

04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:41:14.390 --> 04:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
some of them do have the re the um
 
04:41:14.400 --> 04:41:15.270 align:start position:0%
some of them do have the re the um
the

04:41:15.270 --> 04:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:41:18.070 --> 04:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh certificate of need type of language
 
04:41:19.670 --> 04:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
in there um
 
04:41:21.510 --> 04:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
in other states like massachusetts has a
 
04:41:23.590 --> 04:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
certificate of need type of language in
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
their statute
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
um but i wasn't i didn't verify that all
 
04:41:29.470 --> 04:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
of that all of the
 
04:41:32.628 --> 04:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
44 other states had their certificate of
 
04:41:34.868 --> 04:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
need type of language in their statutes
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
but this is a 30 year old statute so
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's may ask you just about the little
 
04:41:40.948 --> 04:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
question for the question being inquired
 
04:41:43.110 --> 04:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
thanks pretty much um i'm sorry to
 
04:41:44.708 --> 04:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
belabor this
 
04:41:49.590 --> 04:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
so if 44 states have this requirement
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire is presumably one of
 
04:41:53.350 --> 04:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
the 44
 
04:41:53.360 --> 04:41:54.948 align:start position:0%
the 44
um

04:41:54.948 --> 04:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:58.470 --> 04:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
six states decided to get rid of it was
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
do you know whether it was
 
04:42:02.070 --> 04:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
recent that they got rid of this
 
04:42:04.310 --> 04:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
requirement i i am concerned that
 
04:42:05.910 --> 04:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
there's no one from
 
04:42:08.788 --> 04:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
the state that can answer why this is in
 
04:42:10.150 --> 04:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
place i guess
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah because
 
04:42:14.470 --> 04:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
christie the state whenever we ask any
 
04:42:16.070 --> 04:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's our insurance department
 
04:42:20.550 --> 04:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:22.310 --> 04:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
so so they can tell us what's the
 
04:42:24.310 --> 04:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
compelling reason to keep it
 
04:42:24.320 --> 04:42:25.110 align:start position:0%
compelling reason to keep it
maybe

04:42:25.110 --> 04:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:42:26.948 --> 04:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
i mean well we have a complaint once a
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
year but you know they it's it's hard to
 
04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
get them to defend the statue they're
 
04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
there that that we
 
04:42:33.430 --> 04:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
that we passed
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
i mean that response certainly that's my
 
04:42:37.750 --> 04:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
concern is that that i understand they
 
04:42:40.150 --> 04:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
won't take a position i'm just
 
04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're one of
 
04:42:44.948 --> 04:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
what most of the states have but there's
 
04:42:48.070 --> 04:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:49.990 --> 04:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay would you believe yeah thank you
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for the thank you for
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
the court uh question and i did want to
 
04:42:57.110 --> 04:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
um clarify my last statement that it
 
04:42:59.030 --> 04:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
hasn't been this statute hasn't been
 
04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
amended in the last 30 years
 
04:43:06.868 --> 04:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
um but i did ask um i did try and get um
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
information i did ask ols whether or not
 
04:43:11.110 --> 04:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
these um
 
04:43:13.270 --> 04:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
six states that
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
that don't have the regulation if they
 
04:43:16.948 --> 04:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
repealed it and when
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:43:20.070 --> 04:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
the ols
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
looked back as far as they could um and
 
04:43:25.590 --> 04:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't see that there was a repeal
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
and so it's possible
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
that they just never had uh any
 
04:43:30.320 --> 04:43:31.830 align:start position:0%
that they just never had uh any
requirement

04:43:31.830 --> 04:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
04:43:33.510 --> 04:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:43:33.520 --> 04:43:34.550 align:start position:0%
and so
uh

04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
and obviously not all the all the
 
04:43:39.430 --> 04:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
statutes would be the same so some
 
04:43:42.070 --> 04:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
states may regulate more or less
 
04:43:45.750 --> 04:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
um than our state but those six states
 
04:43:47.910 --> 04:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
they did not find any statute ever
 
04:43:50.788 --> 04:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
existing for regulation of those uh
 
04:43:53.110 --> 04:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
household good movers so
 
04:43:55.110 --> 04:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
i hope that was requested
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:58.230 --> 04:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:43:58.240 --> 04:43:59.190 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you for taking my
question

04:43:59.190 --> 04:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:44:01.350 --> 04:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
i actually was rather surprised to hear
 
04:44:03.270 --> 04:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
that there are several complaints every
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
year considering that there are only 34
 
04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
companies doing this
 
04:44:10.150 --> 04:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if you have a sense of
 
04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
what those complaints are and whether
 
04:44:15.270 --> 04:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's one particular company that's uh
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
involved with the complaints and whether
 
04:44:19.990 --> 04:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
this repealing this would make that
 
04:44:25.350 --> 04:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:27.430 --> 04:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay that i guess that's for you josh
 
04:44:30.868 --> 04:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
but um it is for josh yes thank you
 
04:44:32.470 --> 04:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
04:44:34.788 --> 04:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
for the question i
 
04:44:36.150 --> 04:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
would have to direct you to the
 
04:44:38.868 --> 04:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
department and because i only asked how
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
often they are coming up with issues i
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
did not ask which specific companies and
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
and get into the nitty-gritty detail of
 
04:44:48.550 --> 04:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
what each complaint was about they they
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
just said that most of the the um the
 
04:44:53.830 --> 04:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
complaints were solved with just calling
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
the company um they they didn't they
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
didn't say that very often that they
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
even needed to contact
 
04:45:01.680 --> 04:45:03.270 align:start position:0%
even needed to contact
um

04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:06.550 --> 04:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
the troop to investigate more more fully
 
04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
than just a phone call but they would be
 
04:45:10.470 --> 04:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
better to answer that question i believe
 
04:45:12.150 --> 04:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so eric can you help us out with
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
that one that question yes i can um
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
the complaints that we get are mostly uh
 
04:45:18.000 --> 04:45:19.670 align:start position:0%
the complaints that we get are mostly uh
uh

04:45:19.670 --> 04:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:22.230 --> 04:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
also good carriers that are
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
certified with us uh
 
04:45:26.868 --> 04:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
basically complaining about other
 
04:45:28.470 --> 04:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
household good carriers out there that
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
are not
 
04:45:29.520 --> 04:45:33.350 align:start position:0%
are not
certified

04:45:33.350 --> 04:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:34.708 --> 04:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
that they donate
 
04:45:37.030 --> 04:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
basically their competition
 
04:45:39.270 --> 04:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
is uh they realize that they're not
 
04:45:41.110 --> 04:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
certified they call us
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
we follow up
 
04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
we also and then we also forward it over
 
04:45:49.590 --> 04:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
to uh troop g and uh normally that leads
 
04:45:52.948 --> 04:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
to that company um becoming certified
 
04:45:54.310 --> 04:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
with us you know through the hearing
 
04:45:56.550 --> 04:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
process and everything so
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:02.310 --> 04:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
so you're all set okay that's the next
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
and joyce and connor you guys are done
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
you want to put your hands down
 
04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
are you oh you do have a question okay
 
04:46:17.910 --> 04:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
yeah my question is well first my
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
observation is maybe there aren't that
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
many complaints because there is a
 
04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
certification process you have to go
 
04:46:25.270 --> 04:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
through in order to get
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
able to do that business
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm what i'm getting at is if if
 
04:46:33.030 --> 04:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
you have a truck and a couple guys that
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
are brawny
 
04:46:36.708 --> 04:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
and you slap a banner on and said moves
 
04:46:37.990 --> 04:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
are us
 
04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh you're good to go
 
04:46:41.430 --> 04:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
but uh i don't think that's
 
04:46:43.110 --> 04:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's the kind of
 
04:46:43.120 --> 04:46:44.628 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's the kind of
criteria

04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
04:46:46.070 --> 04:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
i think you have to have to be some
 
04:46:47.910 --> 04:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
principles and criteria to get into a
 
04:46:47.920 --> 04:46:48.868 align:start position:0%
principles and criteria to get into a
business

04:46:48.868 --> 04:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
and that i think is what a certification
 
04:46:51.360 --> 04:46:52.390 align:start position:0%
and that i think is what a certification
process

04:46:52.390 --> 04:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:46:52.400 --> 04:46:53.670 align:start position:0%
process
is

04:46:53.670 --> 04:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:46:57.670 --> 04:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
so my question is i'm not quite sure
 
04:47:00.150 --> 04:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what benefit
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
is going to come to the puppy public at
 
04:47:02.160 --> 04:47:03.190 align:start position:0%
is going to come to the puppy public at
large

04:47:03.190 --> 04:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
large
 
04:47:05.590 --> 04:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
because anybody who wants to doesn't
 
04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
need to get a certification in order to
 
04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
do a business
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
and and that's the uh that's the issue i
 
04:47:11.840 --> 04:47:12.628 align:start position:0%
and and that's the uh that's the issue i
i

04:47:12.628 --> 04:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:47:14.948 --> 04:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
i that worries me
 
04:47:17.590 --> 04:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
and it may not sound
 
04:47:19.110 --> 04:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know my question is would you
 
04:47:21.510 --> 04:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
believe i think that
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
in most professional
 
04:47:23.520 --> 04:47:24.628 align:start position:0%
in most professional
endeavors

04:47:24.628 --> 04:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
endeavors
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
there are certification processes that
 
04:47:28.628 --> 04:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
are required
 
04:47:31.590 --> 04:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't surprise me
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh that uh
 
04:47:35.270 --> 04:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
there is such a thing here when it comes
 
04:47:37.750 --> 04:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
to moving people's personal belongings
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
especially if you go across interstate
 
04:47:39.760 --> 04:47:43.430 align:start position:0%
especially if you go across interstate
lines

04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know what you i don't know
 
04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
what you hope to accomplish here
 
04:47:50.810 --> 04:47:50.820 align:start position:0%

04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
this is this is a oddball hearing i
 
04:48:17.350 --> 04:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
never had a hearing like this before but
 
04:48:19.270 --> 04:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's sort of almost a subcommittee but
 
04:48:20.628 --> 04:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh because we're all just trying to get
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
our arms around this issue so uh connie
 
04:48:24.628 --> 04:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
do you want to go uh representative van
 
04:48:25.830 --> 04:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
houden you want to go ahead with your
 
04:48:27.990 --> 04:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you and and thank you
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative for again indulging me
 
04:48:32.230 --> 04:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious as to how this issue
 
04:48:34.230 --> 04:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
came to your attention what brought your
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
eye to this it's not something that the
 
04:48:38.070 --> 04:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
average person would know about was
 
04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
there an issue or concern that brought
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um so there
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
is some agencies out there that look and
 
04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
rank state by state bar for how
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
hard it is to get into certain types of
 
04:48:57.670 --> 04:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
fields and stuff and the barriers that
 
04:48:59.190 --> 04:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
that are there
 
04:49:01.830 --> 04:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
and so it was brought to my attention
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
through those types of um organizations
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
that said okay there's um
 
04:49:09.350 --> 04:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
essentially a certificate of need type
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
of thing here and so
 
04:49:13.830 --> 04:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
um that creates a barrier to entry where
 
04:49:16.230 --> 04:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
they have to prove themselves and so
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's an unusual hurdle that they
 
04:49:23.110 --> 04:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
classified as you know pretty bad so i i
 
04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring it to the attention of
 
04:49:27.750 --> 04:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
of uh the committee and the literature
 
04:49:29.830 --> 04:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
as well but instead of instead of just
 
04:49:32.070 --> 04:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
getting rid of that clause you decide to
 
04:49:33.910 --> 04:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
just get rid of the whole regulation
 
04:49:33.920 --> 04:49:37.830 align:start position:0%
just get rid of the whole regulation
because

04:49:37.830 --> 04:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:37.840 --> 04:49:39.350 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
yes so thank you for the thank you for
 
04:49:46.230 --> 04:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
the question um yes i i looked um
 
04:49:49.750 --> 04:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
at the statute and i didn't see any
 
04:49:52.470 --> 04:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
anything that that uh
 
04:49:52.480 --> 04:49:53.430 align:start position:0%
anything that that uh
really

04:49:53.430 --> 04:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:49:55.830 --> 04:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
brought the safety
 
04:49:58.230 --> 04:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire and so and since
 
04:50:00.070 --> 04:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's other states that don't have it
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
i really um didn't think that it was
 
04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
entirely necessary and since as the um
 
04:50:06.240 --> 04:50:07.270 align:start position:0%
entirely necessary and since as the um
the

04:50:07.270 --> 04:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:50:10.310 --> 04:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
department has has just testified
 
04:50:12.708 --> 04:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
that uh the complaints really are just
 
04:50:14.550 --> 04:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
from other people not being licensed not
 
04:50:14.560 --> 04:50:15.270 align:start position:0%
from other people not being licensed not
from

04:50:15.270 --> 04:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:50:18.390 --> 04:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
nefarious actors uh who could see me so
 
04:50:21.110 --> 04:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so what are we asking uh so um mr
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
burke um i i don't know what your title
 
04:50:25.110 --> 04:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
is so
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
what's your um could you could you help
 
04:50:28.390 --> 04:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
us out a little bit about the complaints
 
04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
and how many complaints and was there
 
04:50:31.830 --> 04:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
any is there any consistent one being
 
04:50:33.670 --> 04:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
complained or is it really just
 
04:50:37.110 --> 04:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
people complaining that other unlicensed
 
04:50:39.590 --> 04:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh moving companies are out there
 
04:50:41.590 --> 04:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
well usually the complaint will come
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
into um
 
04:50:43.200 --> 04:50:44.230 align:start position:0%
into um
rotol

04:50:44.230 --> 04:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
rotol
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
because that's
 
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
they they regulate that
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
i i can tell you on the federal motor
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
carrier side because we enforce the
 
04:50:53.750 --> 04:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
federal motor carrier rules and
 
04:50:53.760 --> 04:50:55.910 align:start position:0%
federal motor carrier rules and
regulations

04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
we we do all the truck enforcement we're
 
04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
the truck guys out there right you're
 
04:51:01.430 --> 04:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
the trucker yes household goods people
 
04:51:03.190 --> 04:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
are extremely regulated through federal
 
04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
motor carrier
 
04:51:05.830 --> 04:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
because of things that have happened in
 
04:51:08.310 --> 04:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
the past things like hostage freight
 
04:51:11.350 --> 04:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
happens where you pay a mover
 
04:51:13.190 --> 04:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
say he gives you a quote of you know two
 
04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to move your goods from
 
04:51:16.470 --> 04:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
point a to point b
 
04:51:18.390 --> 04:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
if you cross state lines you fall under
 
04:51:20.310 --> 04:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
federal motor carriers regulations and
 
04:51:21.590 --> 04:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
federal motor carrier would deal with
 
04:51:23.670 --> 04:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
that issue but if you move safe from
 
04:51:26.070 --> 04:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
nashua to guilford
 
04:51:27.830 --> 04:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
well that's interest state federal motor
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
carrier is not going to get involved in
 
04:51:29.280 --> 04:51:30.150 align:start position:0%
carrier is not going to get involved in
that

04:51:30.150 --> 04:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:30.160 --> 04:51:31.190 align:start position:0%
that
so

04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
i believe and i can't say it for sure i
 
04:51:35.990 --> 04:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
just got notified about this today
 
04:51:36.000 --> 04:51:37.830 align:start position:0%
just got notified about this today
um

04:51:37.830 --> 04:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:39.510 --> 04:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
this was all brought up in the 80s when
 
04:51:41.270 --> 04:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
this was kind of the hotbed thing they
 
04:51:42.390 --> 04:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
would say okay we're gonna charge you
 
04:51:43.590 --> 04:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars to move your goods
 
04:51:45.190 --> 04:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
from point a to point b
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
so once they pick up your goods they say
 
04:51:48.550 --> 04:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
well it took a little bit more than we
 
04:51:50.070 --> 04:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
had to do so it's now four thousand
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
dollars and you're not getting your
 
04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
stuff back until we get paid
 
04:51:54.000 --> 04:51:54.788 align:start position:0%
stuff back until we get paid
so

04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:57.190 --> 04:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
the regulations came about due to things
 
04:51:58.628 --> 04:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:52:00.390 --> 04:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
and there's other things that i look at
 
04:52:01.990 --> 04:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
when i've looked at the statute today
 
04:52:03.430 --> 04:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
like it mandates they have to have
 
04:52:05.910 --> 04:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
insurance so if the truck catches fire
 
04:52:07.590 --> 04:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
with all your household goods inside of
 
04:52:10.390 --> 04:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
it and this guy has no insurance
 
04:52:12.550 --> 04:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to all your stuff
 
04:52:14.310 --> 04:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
who's going to pay for all that
 
04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't your homeowners cover that
 
04:52:17.990 --> 04:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know if your homeowners does or
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
not but i would want that carrier to be
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
insured for all my stuff if the truck
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
caught fire or got an accident or
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
something i would uh not that i'm an
 
04:52:28.150 --> 04:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
expert on this subject
 
04:52:30.070 --> 04:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
but i did have a camera stolen out of a
 
04:52:31.510 --> 04:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
car and
 
04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
they told me i get that covered under my
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
home owners oh okay so awesome leave
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
your home owners use it so but it is
 
04:52:39.190 --> 04:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
true if you're moving your whole house
 
04:52:40.708 --> 04:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
from one house to another you might not
 
04:52:43.030 --> 04:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
have you might be in between homeowners
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
right you might have canceled your old
 
04:52:46.390 --> 04:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
home and haven't set up your new home
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
um so there's there's a lot of things
 
04:52:52.550 --> 04:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
that that come about through this
 
04:52:54.230 --> 04:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
usually if we get a complaint it's
 
04:52:55.590 --> 04:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
usually through federal motor carrier
 
04:52:55.600 --> 04:52:57.110 align:start position:0%
usually through federal motor carrier
because

04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire did it smart in my opinion
 
04:53:02.550 --> 04:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
way way back in the 80s we adopted under
 
04:53:05.830 --> 04:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
266 72a we adopted all the federal not
 
04:53:07.270 --> 04:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
all but most of the federal motor
 
04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
carrier rules and regulations
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
from cdl licensing to how trucks operate
 
04:53:12.000 --> 04:53:13.270 align:start position:0%
from cdl licensing to how trucks operate
to

04:53:13.270 --> 04:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:53:15.350 --> 04:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
um you know how they have to perform
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
mechanically on the side of the road
 
04:53:19.670 --> 04:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
some states have
 
04:53:20.708 --> 04:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:53:22.150 --> 04:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
the federal rules and then they have
 
04:53:23.990 --> 04:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
their own state rules
 
04:53:25.830 --> 04:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
so you could be legal
 
04:53:27.830 --> 04:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the state but violating federal rules
 
04:53:29.350 --> 04:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
and vice versa and that gets very
 
04:53:31.990 --> 04:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
confusing for trucking companies
 
04:53:33.750 --> 04:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire just said these rules
 
04:53:34.868 --> 04:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
are ours
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the statute one
 
04:53:38.230 --> 04:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
statute they did not put in there for
 
04:53:41.430 --> 04:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
federal mortar carrier was 375.
 
04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
so i believe that's why the state went
 
04:53:45.430 --> 04:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
and made their own rules
 
04:53:47.110 --> 04:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
their own regulation
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
under our own 375
 
04:53:49.680 --> 04:53:50.470 align:start position:0%
under our own 375
to

04:53:50.470 --> 04:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:53:54.868 --> 04:53:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:57.030 --> 04:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay so representative bartlett you're
 
04:53:59.190 --> 04:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
still top of the list for questions here
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
you thanks very much um
 
04:54:04.868 --> 04:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh representative ukela
 
04:54:06.550 --> 04:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
you said that there were agencies that
 
04:54:09.030 --> 04:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
identify um
 
04:54:10.708 --> 04:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
complaints like this i would like to
 
04:54:14.310 --> 04:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
know what agency identified you
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
notified you or you notified them that
 
04:54:22.628 --> 04:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:24.070 --> 04:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the thank you for the
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
question um so
 
04:54:26.400 --> 04:54:27.590 align:start position:0%
question um so
i

04:54:27.590 --> 04:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:54:31.510 --> 04:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
i looked up on the on a website called
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
um freedom in the 50states.org
 
04:54:36.230 --> 04:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's what had
 
04:54:36.240 --> 04:54:37.110 align:start position:0%
that's what had
um

04:54:37.110 --> 04:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:38.948 --> 04:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
that was actually one of the states that
 
04:54:40.708 --> 04:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
i looked at to
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
decide that i was going to move to new
 
04:54:44.708 --> 04:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire when i decided to move to new
 
04:54:47.350 --> 04:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire so um i'm very familiar with
 
04:54:47.360 --> 04:54:48.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire so um i'm very familiar with
that

04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:48.080 --> 04:54:49.750 align:start position:0%
that
that

04:54:49.750 --> 04:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:51.270 --> 04:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
they rank the different states on
 
04:54:52.788 --> 04:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
different uh
 
04:54:55.350 --> 04:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
different um regulations
 
04:54:57.350 --> 04:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
all different types of things so
 
04:54:59.830 --> 04:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
that that was the
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
so this site
 
04:55:03.430 --> 04:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
so this agency
 
04:55:06.628 --> 04:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
you so you use this as your
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
go-to place to figure out if
 
04:55:13.030 --> 04:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
there's too many regulations
 
04:55:16.150 --> 04:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
no no so i was just reading
 
04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
so when i when i
 
04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
was deciding on where i wanted to live
 
04:55:24.830 --> 04:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
in this country i i read a bunch of
 
04:55:26.470 --> 04:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
different um
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
states kind of like summaries
 
04:55:32.310 --> 04:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
and um one of the things listed
 
04:55:34.948 --> 04:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
was that we regulate household goods
 
04:55:34.958 --> 04:55:37.270 align:start position:0%
was that we regulate household goods
carriers

04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
as as one of the things that they
 
04:55:41.110 --> 04:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
brought up and so
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
when i was
 
04:55:46.708 --> 04:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
researching that regulation that's when
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
i found
 
04:55:52.150 --> 04:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
that we have this um
 
04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
issuance requirement and so i thought
 
04:55:57.270 --> 04:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
that that was
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
i i think that when we got rid of it for
 
04:56:02.070 --> 04:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
um i thought it was unusual that we
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
would have this requirement when we got
 
04:56:05.830 --> 04:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
rid of it for
 
04:56:05.840 --> 04:56:07.350 align:start position:0%
rid of it for
um

04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals so
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
for that reason i thought what this is i
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
think something that that
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
fell through the cracks kind of a thing
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
totally different animals yeah i was
 
04:56:19.750 --> 04:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
just going to say i'm not sure
 
04:56:22.070 --> 04:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
however don't be a gracious once someone
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
gave me a board game called silly laws
 
04:56:26.150 --> 04:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
and i said well i can win this game i'll
 
04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
i know it so it wasn't
 
04:56:29.670 --> 04:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
the silly law for new hampshire i did
 
04:56:32.708 --> 04:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
not know this one and it was you can't
 
04:56:34.948 --> 04:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
uh they at a pawn broker you can't take
 
04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
your jacket off and try to pawn your
 
04:56:37.200 --> 04:56:39.030 align:start position:0%
your jacket off and try to pawn your
jacket

04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
jacket
 
04:56:40.470 --> 04:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
believe it or not that's still in the
 
04:56:42.150 --> 04:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
statute and no i never went and tried it
 
04:56:43.590 --> 04:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
well we'll be looking for that one for
 
04:56:46.788 --> 04:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:46.798 --> 04:56:50.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:56:50.150 --> 04:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:51.670 --> 04:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for my question and thank
 
04:56:54.788 --> 04:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um representative
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
this might be a question for the
 
04:56:56.240 --> 04:56:58.310 align:start position:0%
this might be a question for the
agencies

04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
yeah in the statute um i'm just pulling
 
04:57:02.470 --> 04:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
it up here so i can read it
 
04:57:06.390 --> 04:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
section 375 a colon three
 
04:57:08.310 --> 04:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's just kind of odd that there's a
 
04:57:11.510 --> 04:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's a determining determination
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
about what is
 
04:57:15.430 --> 04:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
present what is required by the present
 
04:57:17.030 --> 04:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
or future
 
04:57:19.830 --> 04:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
public convenience and necessity
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
how would
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
no offense but how would a government
 
04:57:23.760 --> 04:57:25.110 align:start position:0%
no offense but how would a government
bureaucrat

04:57:25.110 --> 04:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
know what the future
 
04:57:29.190 --> 04:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
necessity is
 
04:57:31.190 --> 04:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
or the future public convenience how
 
04:57:32.788 --> 04:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
would you possibly make that
 
04:57:32.798 --> 04:57:37.510 align:start position:0%
would you possibly make that
determination

04:57:37.510 --> 04:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:39.430 --> 04:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
did one of you want to dare to take that
 
04:57:39.440 --> 04:57:41.670 align:start position:0%
did one of you want to dare to take that
question

04:57:41.670 --> 04:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:57:43.350 --> 04:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
eric or bill
 
04:57:46.310 --> 04:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
um the only thing i would have to could
 
04:57:48.150 --> 04:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
say i can't answer that because these
 
04:57:50.070 --> 04:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
these go before hearings and they're the
 
04:57:51.670 --> 04:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
ones that would that our hearings bureau
 
04:57:52.868 --> 04:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
and they're the ones that decides on
 
04:57:55.990 --> 04:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
that i mean i could
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
i can't even begin to
 
04:58:00.310 --> 04:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
try to answer that i have no idea sorry
 
04:58:02.310 --> 04:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
to say but i can find out if they have
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
an opinion on it
 
04:58:05.590 --> 04:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
i mean it would have to be based on some
 
04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
kind of data right and how do you
 
04:58:08.628 --> 04:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
predict what a future market is going to
 
04:58:10.150 --> 04:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
look like that just seems
 
04:58:10.160 --> 04:58:11.270 align:start position:0%
look like that just seems
impossible

04:58:11.270 --> 04:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
04:58:12.788 --> 04:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's i mean i don't go
 
04:58:14.470 --> 04:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
through the hearings process we just set
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
up the hearings and and off they go over
 
04:58:18.390 --> 04:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
it over to them so
 
04:58:18.400 --> 04:58:19.510 align:start position:0%
it over to them so
um

04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:20.788 --> 04:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
i could try to find out if there's a
 
04:58:22.708 --> 04:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
history there
 
04:58:24.550 --> 04:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
what do you think what do you think
 
04:58:26.150 --> 04:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
officer burt
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh well i'm not quite sure i kind of
 
04:58:29.110 --> 04:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
looked at that as like maybe if they
 
04:58:31.030 --> 04:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
were to it looks like you at one point
 
04:58:35.190 --> 04:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
you can sell your your uh
 
04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
your license to say to someone else if
 
04:58:39.270 --> 04:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
you were to sell the business and maybe
 
04:58:41.110 --> 04:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's for the future
 
04:58:42.628 --> 04:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
person that may buy it like they would
 
04:58:44.070 --> 04:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
have to like
 
04:58:46.708 --> 04:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
selling a taxi medallion yeah i don't i
 
04:58:48.628 --> 04:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
don't see excuse me for jumping in i
 
04:58:49.990 --> 04:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
don't see anything about selling your
 
04:58:51.990 --> 04:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
stuff this looks like when it's issued
 
04:58:56.230 --> 04:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
or denied so i'm looking at 375-a
 
04:58:57.670 --> 04:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
colon three
 
04:58:58.788 --> 04:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
04:59:00.628 --> 04:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
like eric i'm not familiar with it this
 
04:59:02.310 --> 04:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
probably dates back it goes back to when
 
04:59:04.390 --> 04:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
there was railroads and
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
and whether you really want to move or
 
04:59:08.310 --> 04:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
move things by truck versus really i
 
04:59:09.990 --> 04:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
mean i i would have to say this was that
 
04:59:11.750 --> 04:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
this did start in the public utilities
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
commission and came over to us so
 
04:59:17.910 --> 04:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
and it's been around a long time
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
04:59:21.590 --> 04:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative weston
 
04:59:23.430 --> 04:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh thank you for taking my
 
04:59:25.750 --> 04:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
question this may actually be for the
 
04:59:28.150 --> 04:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
state people i'm wondering if there's a
 
04:59:29.830 --> 04:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
fee involved with getting this
 
04:59:29.840 --> 04:59:32.948 align:start position:0%
fee involved with getting this
certificate

04:59:32.948 --> 04:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:34.150 --> 04:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
04:59:35.990 --> 04:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
50 fee
 
04:59:37.190 --> 04:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
they pay
 
04:59:40.390 --> 04:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:42.230 --> 04:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
for they pay that to us before the
 
04:59:43.830 --> 04:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
hearing then after the hearing when it's
 
04:59:45.670 --> 04:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
approved it's a ten dollar
 
04:59:45.680 --> 04:59:46.628 align:start position:0%
approved it's a ten dollar
uh

04:59:46.628 --> 04:59:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
renewal fee every year
 
04:59:52.150 --> 04:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
a follow-up for the question may inquire
 
04:59:56.230 --> 04:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.240 --> 04:59:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:59:57.990 --> 04:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:58.000 --> 04:59:58.708 align:start position:0%
um
i

04:59:58.708 --> 04:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:00:00.390 --> 05:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
would have to get back to you on that
 
05:00:03.270 --> 05:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
the 50 fee i basically it's a it's a
 
05:00:04.628 --> 05:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
05:00:07.590 --> 05:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
application fee as far as i know
 
05:00:07.600 --> 05:00:10.070 align:start position:0%
application fee as far as i know
so

05:00:10.070 --> 05:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%

05:00:15.430 --> 05:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
department are you depre is your
 
05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:22.070 --> 05:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
oh what safety
 
05:00:23.830 --> 05:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
oh i know

with what department here okay yeah
 
05:00:30.868 --> 05:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
they're both department of safety
 
05:00:33.190 --> 05:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
but the one is troop g so he's a state
 
05:00:35.670 --> 05:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
trooper and the other one is from there
 
05:00:37.350 --> 05:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
was one point in time
 
05:00:39.510 --> 05:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
the highway the highway group was not
 
05:00:40.788 --> 05:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
part of the state troop they were
 
05:00:43.270 --> 05:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
actually a separate entity so erica's
 
05:00:46.550 --> 05:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
was is from is uh as they called tolls
 
05:00:49.030 --> 05:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
and it was a different division that got
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
merged in the department of safety
 
05:00:54.150 --> 05:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you if i had that correct
 
05:00:59.270 --> 05:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%

a few things about about kratom
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's been around since the late 1800s uh
 
05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
from when it's been recorded in history
 
05:04:08.070 --> 05:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
however it began being more widely used
 
05:04:10.550 --> 05:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the united states around uh in the

05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
few of the countries that where it grows
 
05:04:33.030 --> 05:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
because it needs the right type of
 
05:04:36.708 --> 05:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
alkaline soil and humidity to grow
 
05:04:40.470 --> 05:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
now kratom uh is a product that is used
 
05:04:40.480 --> 05:04:41.270 align:start position:0%
now kratom uh is a product that is used
uh

05:04:41.270 --> 05:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:04:43.990 --> 05:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
as both a stimulant and as a sedative it
 
05:04:46.708 --> 05:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
has compounds for both uh there are
 
05:04:49.110 --> 05:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
different strains and the most popular
 
05:04:51.750 --> 05:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
way of using the product is by making a
 
05:04:53.430 --> 05:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
tea from it or adding it to another
 
05:04:55.910 --> 05:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
beverage like orange juice one of my
 
05:04:58.070 --> 05:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
friends does that he puts a scoop in his
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
orange juice in the morning
 
05:05:03.510 --> 05:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
in small doses it acts as a stimulant
 
05:05:05.830 --> 05:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
and in larger doses it acts as a
 
05:05:05.840 --> 05:05:09.030 align:start position:0%
and in larger doses it acts as a
sedative

05:05:09.030 --> 05:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:11.190 --> 05:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
its effects have been known to increase
 
05:05:13.750 --> 05:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
a person's productivity it has mood
 
05:05:15.868 --> 05:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
enhancing capabilities
 
05:05:18.708 --> 05:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
anti-anxiety properties
 
05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
it can be a natural antidepressant and
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
among many of the consumers who
 
05:05:24.788 --> 05:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
currently use the product they are
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
having fewer
 
05:05:29.430 --> 05:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
negative effects than they would if they
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:38.470 --> 05:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
the effects of kratom can be felt uh
 
05:05:40.230 --> 05:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
within five to ten minutes after
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
ingesting it and uh
 
05:05:46.470 --> 05:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
it will stay in the person's system from
 
05:05:48.230 --> 05:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
two to five days and depending on how
 
05:05:50.390 --> 05:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
much the person use it could it could be
 
05:05:52.708 --> 05:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
longer than five days
 
05:05:55.270 --> 05:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh i believe if i'm right it's the
 
05:05:57.830 --> 05:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
cousin of a coffee bean plant
 
05:05:59.430 --> 05:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
when you order it or you purchase it
 
05:06:01.350 --> 05:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
you'll receive it in a leaf form or
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:08.628 --> 05:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
in the research i did find out that it
 
05:06:12.070 --> 05:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
can be toxic if in high doses
 
05:06:14.230 --> 05:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
if it's taken improperly
 
05:06:16.470 --> 05:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
there could be a small addictive piece
 
05:06:19.110 --> 05:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
to it if it's taken improperly
 
05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
and for all of these reasons above are
 
05:06:23.990 --> 05:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we're bringing hb 333 to
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
you today
 
05:06:26.948 --> 05:06:26.958 align:start position:0%
now i was approached by a constituent
 
05:06:29.350 --> 05:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
who's going to be speaking behind me
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
today mr seamus casey
 
05:06:33.190 --> 05:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh who has done a lot of work in this
 
05:06:33.200 --> 05:06:34.070 align:start position:0%
uh who has done a lot of work in this
state

05:06:34.070 --> 05:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:06:35.910 --> 05:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
and he is probably the biggest advocate
 
05:06:39.190 --> 05:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
of kratom also behind me is uh matt
 
05:06:40.550 --> 05:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
hatto from the american kratom
 
05:06:40.560 --> 05:06:42.150 align:start position:0%
hatto from the american kratom
association

05:06:42.150 --> 05:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
association
 
05:06:43.750 --> 05:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
they did not have to work hard to
 
05:06:45.910 --> 05:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
persuade me to bring this bill forward
 
05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
in my personal history i've never
 
05:06:49.270 --> 05:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
purchased this product or used this
 
05:06:52.550 --> 05:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
product but i do know many who have and
 
05:06:54.390 --> 05:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
in each and every case they've told me
 
05:06:56.708 --> 05:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
that it truly helps them
 
05:06:58.230 --> 05:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
one of my friends is a veteran he
 
05:07:00.868 --> 05:07:00.878 align:start position:0%
suffers from ptsd
 
05:07:03.590 --> 05:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
and he takes kratom every morning this
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
is the guy with the orange juice
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
he takes kratom every morning and he
 
05:07:09.910 --> 05:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
said that if it wasn't for this product
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
that he just didn't know how he would be
 
05:07:13.430 --> 05:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
able to operate
 
05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
a few others i know tell me that it can
 
05:07:18.948 --> 05:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
help them focus and be alert
 
05:07:20.310 --> 05:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
and that they're just much more
 
05:07:20.320 --> 05:07:22.230 align:start position:0%
and that they're just much more
productive

05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
productive
 
05:07:24.310 --> 05:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
now i'm not normally one to bring a bill
 
05:07:26.708 --> 05:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
forward that creates regulation or grows
 
05:07:29.110 --> 05:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
the size of government but
 
05:07:30.550 --> 05:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
i also feel that there should have
 
05:07:32.070 --> 05:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
probably been a financial note that was
 
05:07:33.430 --> 05:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
added to this bill but it didn't come
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
out of ols that way
 
05:07:37.830 --> 05:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
but as you'll hear from those behind me
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
the experts in the industry and others
 
05:07:41.190 --> 05:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
who are going to testify
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
many of them are asking for the
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
regulation from both the industry and
 
05:07:46.868 --> 05:07:46.878 align:start position:0%
the consumers
 
05:07:46.878 --> 05:07:49.110 align:start position:0%
the consumers
um

05:07:49.110 --> 05:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:52.470 --> 05:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
the product is currently legal
 
05:07:55.110 --> 05:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
and they just want to make sure that the
 
05:07:59.270 --> 05:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
product can only be sold unadulterated
 
05:08:00.868 --> 05:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
in its true form
 
05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
and within the bill there are there are
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
provisions of how it needs to be sold
 
05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
they do not want it tainted with other
 
05:08:10.868 --> 05:08:10.878 align:start position:0%
products and i i would agree with
 
05:08:12.868 --> 05:08:12.878 align:start position:0%
anybody on any type of
 
05:08:14.830 --> 05:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
product or compound that you're using
 
05:08:17.670 --> 05:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
like other substances can make it act
 
05:08:19.350 --> 05:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
differently and definitely not
 
05:08:20.628 --> 05:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
substances that are listed in the
 
05:08:22.708 --> 05:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
controlled substance act we wouldn't
 
05:08:25.030 --> 05:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
want any of that and you need to be 18
 
05:08:27.110 --> 05:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
years old to purchase it
 
05:08:28.868 --> 05:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
there are violations that are built into
 
05:08:31.430 --> 05:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
bill concerning the sale of the product
 
05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
but it is considered as a food product
 
05:08:35.430 --> 05:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
or a dietary supplement
 
05:08:37.750 --> 05:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
now again i'm not the expert but i do
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
feel that we have an obligation to
 
05:08:42.310 --> 05:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
listen to our consumers and industries
 
05:08:43.990 --> 05:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
especially when they together are
 
05:08:45.830 --> 05:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
requesting our help
 
05:08:47.430 --> 05:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:08:49.030 --> 05:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
we'd like to try to get ahead of any
 
05:08:51.750 --> 05:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
scheduling it is it is not illegal now
 
05:08:53.430 --> 05:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
and there have been some wins in this
 
05:08:55.350 --> 05:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
area and the people behind me are going
 
05:08:57.190 --> 05:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
to talk to you about that
 
05:08:58.628 --> 05:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
i would like for them to talk more of
 
05:09:00.310 --> 05:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
that we've had some wins in states and
 
05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
wins federally about this product
 
05:09:05.030 --> 05:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
we we just want to make sure that
 
05:09:07.190 --> 05:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
something gets created in new hampshire
 
05:09:09.030 --> 05:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
to protect our consumers
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
now a kratom bill was brought before the
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
senate last term sb 758
 
05:09:15.670 --> 05:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
and while it was delivered as a bill to
 
05:09:17.830 --> 05:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
ban the product the senate chose to
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
amend it and turn it into a bill to
 
05:09:21.510 --> 05:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
regulate the product
 
05:09:24.390 --> 05:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh now this was passed in that body as
 
05:09:26.550 --> 05:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
an ought to pass with amendment but it
 
05:09:29.430 --> 05:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
died on the table last june as did many
 
05:09:32.550 --> 05:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
other bills that we know of
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
in my submitted written testimony i
 
05:09:35.830 --> 05:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
provided some links to the source
 
05:09:37.830 --> 05:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
information to the introduction of this
 
05:09:37.840 --> 05:09:39.190 align:start position:0%
information to the introduction of this
bill

05:09:39.190 --> 05:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
and i will give you a couple of facts
 
05:09:43.110 --> 05:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
before i start closing out here
 
05:09:44.708 --> 05:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
for time's sake
 
05:09:47.830 --> 05:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
in a cnn health article dated april 2019
 
05:09:49.750 --> 05:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
u.s food and drug administration stated
 
05:09:52.310 --> 05:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
that 44 deaths have been associated with
 
05:09:52.320 --> 05:09:53.590 align:start position:0%
that 44 deaths have been associated with
kratom

05:09:53.590 --> 05:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
kratom
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
but in almost all of these cases there
 
05:09:57.750 --> 05:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
were other substances in their body at
 
05:10:00.390 --> 05:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
the time at the time of death now this
 
05:10:02.550 --> 05:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
is less than a percent
 
05:10:05.350 --> 05:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh of all the over over overdose deaths
 
05:10:07.350 --> 05:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
and when i went out to try to find
 
05:10:09.270 --> 05:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
something else that may have been
 
05:10:12.310 --> 05:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
similar in that type of reporting
 
05:10:13.110 --> 05:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
it was
 
05:10:14.470 --> 05:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
sort of equivalent to numbers of those
 
05:10:16.708 --> 05:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
who may have overdosed by aspirin
 
05:10:16.718 --> 05:10:18.070 align:start position:0%
who may have overdosed by aspirin
so

05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:19.910 --> 05:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
with that i'm going to try to answer any
 
05:10:21.750 --> 05:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions you have but i truly feel i
 
05:10:23.830 --> 05:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
should defer most of the questions to
 
05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
those testifying behind me as they'll be
 
05:10:27.750 --> 05:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
able to answer them more effectively but
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
i in closing i do feel that listening to
 
05:10:32.070 --> 05:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
our constituents and the industries
 
05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
especially when they agree
 
05:10:35.990 --> 05:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
is a good way for us to find a path to
 
05:10:37.990 --> 05:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
provide predict protections and consumer
 
05:10:38.000 --> 05:10:39.030 align:start position:0%
provide predict protections and consumer
needs

05:10:39.030 --> 05:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
needs
 
05:10:40.628 --> 05:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll say thank you for
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony and i'll take any
 
05:10:44.310 --> 05:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
questions that you have and i hope i can
 
05:10:45.910 --> 05:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
answer them
 
05:10:50.868 --> 05:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
good uh first up is representative abel
 
05:10:52.868 --> 05:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh nunes uh for your
 
05:11:01.350 --> 05:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
testimony um i'm a little confused about
 
05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
what this bill is trying to achieve
 
05:11:06.708 --> 05:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
we have a substance
 
05:11:07.990 --> 05:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:11:11.110 --> 05:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
not regulated not prohibited
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
already available to the consumer
 
05:11:16.628 --> 05:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
and i don't
 
05:11:19.030 --> 05:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
maybe you can tell me a little bit more
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
about why we need to
 
05:11:21.760 --> 05:11:23.110 align:start position:0%
about why we need to
uh

05:11:23.110 --> 05:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:11:25.990 --> 05:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
pass a law that would regulate whether
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
other substances are combined in this it
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make sense to me at this
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
point thank you
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative abel for the
 
05:11:36.868 --> 05:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
question and let me see if i can answer
 
05:11:39.750 --> 05:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
this for you the correct way um we're
 
05:11:42.230 --> 05:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
asking for a regulation to be put in on
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
the bill for a couple of reasons we want
 
05:11:47.590 --> 05:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that number one it's only
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
sold to those that are 18 years of age
 
05:11:51.110 --> 05:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
or older
 
05:11:52.948 --> 05:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
second thing is is that it needs to be
 
05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
in an unadulterated form
 
05:11:57.510 --> 05:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
um kratom can be
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
sold and mixed with other items and if
 
05:12:02.390 --> 05:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's not labeled properly
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't know what's in there
 
05:12:07.270 --> 05:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
we want the labeling to happen we want
 
05:12:08.708 --> 05:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
we want for
 
05:12:11.270 --> 05:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
the the consumers that choose to buy the
 
05:12:13.350 --> 05:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
product to know that they're getting an
 
05:12:15.430 --> 05:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
unadulterated product
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we also want them to be of legal age
 
05:12:22.150 --> 05:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:22.160 --> 05:12:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:12:23.510 --> 05:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:12:27.990 --> 05:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh next up is representative emerson
 
05:12:29.190 --> 05:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
05:12:30.788 --> 05:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
representative nunez for taking my
 
05:12:33.270 --> 05:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
question um on the question of labeling
 
05:12:35.750 --> 05:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
obviously kratom does have some side
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
effects although i guess they're fairly
 
05:12:39.910 --> 05:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
rare on the question of labeling is your
 
05:12:39.920 --> 05:12:40.868 align:start position:0%
rare on the question of labeling is your
um

05:12:40.868 --> 05:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
preference to handle it
 
05:12:44.230 --> 05:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh or intent to handle it through
 
05:12:46.948 --> 05:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
statute or uh just stick with the common
 
05:12:46.958 --> 05:12:47.910 align:start position:0%
statute or uh just stick with the common
law

05:12:47.910 --> 05:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:12:51.350 --> 05:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh duty to notify the consumer
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative abramson for
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
the question i would think that we would
 
05:12:55.750 --> 05:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
probably build in a methodology to this
 
05:12:57.510 --> 05:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
of what needs to happen through the
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
regulation um i'm going to defer part of
 
05:13:03.110 --> 05:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
this question over to
 
05:13:04.708 --> 05:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
those who are speaking behind me that
 
05:13:08.070 --> 05:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
have more uh experience in the industry
 
05:13:10.868 --> 05:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
but but i do think that again we're
 
05:13:13.590 --> 05:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
talking about having labels that uh that
 
05:13:16.550 --> 05:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
prove that it's unadulterated uh because
 
05:13:18.868 --> 05:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
uh it does have effects if something
 
05:13:21.910 --> 05:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
else is mixed in with the product
 
05:13:24.150 --> 05:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
05:13:25.670 --> 05:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
05:13:27.670 --> 05:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative burrows
 
05:13:30.868 --> 05:13:30.878 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question um
 
05:13:32.708 --> 05:13:32.718 align:start position:0%
my question is i'm actually wondering
 
05:13:34.310 --> 05:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
why we aren't
 
05:13:36.708 --> 05:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
discussing banning this product given
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
that the fda
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
has not approved it
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
they state it's been linked to
 
05:13:44.470 --> 05:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
hallucinate hallucinations seizures and
 
05:13:46.550 --> 05:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
liver damage they said there's no
 
05:13:49.430 --> 05:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence to support the uses
 
05:13:51.270 --> 05:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
including withdrawal from heroin
 
05:13:53.750 --> 05:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
morphine and other opioids and they warn
 
05:13:55.750 --> 05:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
people from using it so why why why
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
aren't we why are we talking about
 
05:13:59.190 --> 05:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
regulating it why aren't we talking
 
05:14:01.430 --> 05:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
about banning it
 
05:14:03.510 --> 05:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative burroughs for
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
that question now i believe that we're
 
05:14:07.270 --> 05:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
going to have some testimony coming in
 
05:14:08.628 --> 05:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
behind me that's going to answer this
 
05:14:11.030 --> 05:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
05:14:13.110 --> 05:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
i do know that federally it's been
 
05:14:16.150 --> 05:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
chosen just recently
 
05:14:18.390 --> 05:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to stay on the market
 
05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
and there were a couple of wins in a few
 
05:14:23.750 --> 05:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
other states recently that uh that are
 
05:14:25.750 --> 05:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
putting this type of regulation in on
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
top of it
 
05:14:28.708 --> 05:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh there are many products that are out
 
05:14:28.718 --> 05:14:29.510 align:start position:0%
uh there are many products that are out
there

05:14:29.510 --> 05:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:14:32.708 --> 05:14:32.718 align:start position:0%
that can do exactly what you just said
 
05:14:32.718 --> 05:14:33.510 align:start position:0%
that can do exactly what you just said
and

05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:35.270 --> 05:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
there are many products that are out
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
there that are dietary supplements which
 
05:14:39.110 --> 05:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
is what we consider this to be a dietary
 
05:14:40.948 --> 05:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
supplement uh something that can help
 
05:14:43.670 --> 05:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
you i look at it personally and those
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
behind me may not agree with me but
 
05:14:48.390 --> 05:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
personally i look at it like uh valeria
 
05:14:48.400 --> 05:14:49.110 align:start position:0%
personally i look at it like uh valeria
or

05:14:49.110 --> 05:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:14:53.270 --> 05:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
or a st john's wort or ginkgo biloba
 
05:14:53.280 --> 05:14:54.070 align:start position:0%
or a st john's wort or ginkgo biloba
but

05:14:54.070 --> 05:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:14:55.830 --> 05:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
the effects may be greater depending on
 
05:14:57.990 --> 05:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
the dosage if you follow the
 
05:15:00.150 --> 05:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
instructions and you and you consume the
 
05:15:02.550 --> 05:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
product correctly the effect should be
 
05:15:04.470 --> 05:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
as stated and that's why we're looking
 
05:15:07.430 --> 05:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
for the regulation it is legal across
 
05:15:09.670 --> 05:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
all 50 of the united states right now
 
05:15:11.110 --> 05:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
further question me inquire
 
05:15:15.430 --> 05:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
do you do you believe or have you seen
 
05:15:17.430 --> 05:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
evidence that there are some dietary
 
05:15:19.750 --> 05:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
supplements that are actually unsafe and
 
05:15:19.760 --> 05:15:23.910 align:start position:0%
supplements that are actually unsafe and
dangerous

05:15:23.910 --> 05:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:25.110 --> 05:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs thank you for
 
05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
the question
 
05:15:27.910 --> 05:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to call this product
 
05:15:30.788 --> 05:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
unsafe and dangerous
 
05:15:32.070 --> 05:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
and that's how i'm going to answer your
 
05:15:33.750 --> 05:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
question all right thank you
 
05:15:33.760 --> 05:15:35.270 align:start position:0%
question all right thank you
perfect

05:15:35.270 --> 05:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
05:15:38.070 --> 05:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative van halton
 
05:15:39.910 --> 05:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you representative
 
05:15:42.310 --> 05:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
for your insights i have a couple of
 
05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
05:15:45.350 --> 05:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
one is that you just stated that it's
 
05:15:48.070 --> 05:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
legal across all 50 states is it truly
 
05:15:51.190 --> 05:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
legal is it by law legal or are we just
 
05:15:54.628 --> 05:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
saying that it's not illegal
 
05:15:56.550 --> 05:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative van halen for
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
the question um
 
05:16:02.550 --> 05:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to say is that uh is that
 
05:16:03.990 --> 05:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
there have
 
05:16:05.910 --> 05:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
there were some decisions
 
05:16:08.788 --> 05:16:08.798 align:start position:0%
by the federal government just recently
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
that we're going to talk about in just a
 
05:16:11.910 --> 05:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
few minutes but those who are testifying
 
05:16:13.030 --> 05:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
behind me
 
05:16:14.150 --> 05:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be telling you
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
about what happened with those
 
05:16:15.520 --> 05:16:16.948 align:start position:0%
about what happened with those
regulations

05:16:16.948 --> 05:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
05:16:19.350 --> 05:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
at one point i know that
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
05:16:22.868 --> 05:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
thought about putting it on a schedule
 
05:16:25.750 --> 05:16:25.760 align:start position:0%

05:17:51.190 --> 05:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
currently written due to a direct

definition of a food poses a regulatory
 
05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
challenge for new hampshire the new
 
05:18:08.550 --> 05:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire food safety rules adopt the

food must be obtained from sources that
 
05:18:18.230 --> 05:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
comply with federal state and local laws
 
05:18:20.390 --> 05:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
and must not contain any prohibited

fda has issued warnings regarding the

serious risks associated with the use of
 
05:18:32.310 --> 05:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
kratom fda is concerned that kratom
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
which affects the same opiate brain
 
05:18:36.788 --> 05:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
receptors as morphine appears to have
 
05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
properties that expose users to the risk
 
05:18:41.510 --> 05:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
of addiction abuse and dependence
 
05:18:43.510 --> 05:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
there are no fda approved uses for
 
05:18:45.670 --> 05:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
kratom and the agency has reserved
 
05:18:47.510 --> 05:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
received concerning reports about the
 
05:18:49.590 --> 05:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
safety of its use
 
05:18:51.830 --> 05:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
the department is also aware of reports
 
05:18:53.270 --> 05:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
to the northern new england poison

2012 to 2019
 
05:19:13.510 --> 05:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
whereby the food protection section's
 
05:19:15.030 --> 05:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
mission is to ensure the safety and
 
05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
security of the new hampshire food

definition of food that has not been
 
05:19:22.868 --> 05:19:22.878 align:start position:0%
demonstrated to be safe is in direct
 
05:19:25.350 --> 05:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
conflict with our mission
 
05:19:26.470 --> 05:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
while the bill
 
05:19:28.948 --> 05:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
has criteria for
 
05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
kratom to be sold there is not um
 
05:19:35.270 --> 05:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the bill who
 
05:19:37.190 --> 05:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
which agency would be responsible for
 
05:19:39.670 --> 05:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
enforcing these requirements nor does it
 
05:19:41.670 --> 05:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
provide a structure for the agency to
 
05:19:41.680 --> 05:19:42.390 align:start position:0%
provide a structure for the agency to
provide

05:19:42.390 --> 05:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
provide
 
05:19:45.270 --> 05:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
to regulate kratom effectively
 
05:19:47.190 --> 05:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
it does not provide standards to or
 
05:19:49.830 --> 05:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
testing requirements to ensure consumer
 
05:19:52.310 --> 05:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
product safety and it doesn't preclude
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation to support additional
 
05:19:56.948 --> 05:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
staff and resources necessary
 
05:19:58.708 --> 05:19:58.718 align:start position:0%

uh yes thank you uh chairman uh where
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
where is this actually sold is it sold
 
05:20:22.830 --> 05:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
at like health food stores uh
 
05:20:25.350 --> 05:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know where you might be able
 
05:20:27.190 --> 05:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
to get cbd or
 
05:20:29.830 --> 05:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
i i've never heard of it
 
05:20:29.840 --> 05:20:30.708 align:start position:0%
i i've never heard of it
um

05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of the full scope of
 
05:20:36.070 --> 05:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
where this product is sold but i do know
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
antidotally i believe it would be
 
05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:46.150 --> 05:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
and representative abramson
 
05:20:50.788 --> 05:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:20:52.868 --> 05:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question you
 
05:20:55.270 --> 05:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned kratom as
 
05:20:57.350 --> 05:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know as something the food and drug
 
05:20:59.030 --> 05:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
administration regulates both food and
 
05:21:00.550 --> 05:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
drugs but they regulate them very
 
05:21:00.560 --> 05:21:02.390 align:start position:0%
drugs but they regulate them very
differently

05:21:02.390 --> 05:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
differently
 
05:21:04.150 --> 05:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
what would be the problem with viewing
 
05:21:07.190 --> 05:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
this as just a food product since people
 
05:21:10.390 --> 05:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
are you know similar to coffee if uh
 
05:21:12.390 --> 05:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
people are taking this as tea most of
 
05:21:14.470 --> 05:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
the people who emailed us
 
05:21:15.990 --> 05:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
over the years have said that they just
 
05:21:18.948 --> 05:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
take this as a tea
 
05:21:21.750 --> 05:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes for calming or for for or for
 
05:21:23.990 --> 05:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
getting off of uh opioids or for getting
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
off of heroin or some other uh
 
05:21:28.708 --> 05:21:28.718 align:start position:0%
drug problem but what would be the what
 
05:21:30.150 --> 05:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
would be the problem with the state of
 
05:21:31.910 --> 05:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire viewing this as just an
 
05:21:33.590 --> 05:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
herbal product that people can take as a
 
05:21:33.600 --> 05:21:34.868 align:start position:0%
herbal product that people can take as a
tea

05:21:34.868 --> 05:21:34.878 align:start position:0%
tea
 
05:21:37.750 --> 05:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
so we do rely on
 
05:21:37.760 --> 05:21:38.470 align:start position:0%
so we do rely on
the

05:21:38.470 --> 05:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:21:39.750 --> 05:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
05:21:42.310 --> 05:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
studies that approve this as a food
 
05:21:45.030 --> 05:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
additive and currently for kratom there
 
05:21:46.628 --> 05:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
is nothing
 
05:21:48.550 --> 05:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
out there that proves its safety for
 
05:21:53.910 --> 05:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:53.920 --> 05:21:55.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:21:55.830 --> 05:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:22:01.270 --> 05:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:01.280 --> 05:22:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
hi

05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
hi
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
sorry about that

i forgot i had my screen
 
05:22:06.320 --> 05:22:07.510 align:start position:0%
i forgot i had my screen
so

05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:10.390 --> 05:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
my notes here um
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
05:22:14.868 --> 05:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
um what states have passed a bill
 
05:22:19.110 --> 05:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:21.830 --> 05:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid i can't answer your question
 
05:22:23.910 --> 05:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
some other people will listen to that
 
05:22:26.230 --> 05:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
question for us
 
05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
she's in opposition to the bill but we
 
05:22:29.830 --> 05:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
do have supporters of the bill so i'm
 
05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
sure they'll be able to answer that for
 
05:22:31.520 --> 05:22:33.750 align:start position:0%
sure they'll be able to answer that for
you

05:22:33.750 --> 05:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:39.350 --> 05:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:41.110 --> 05:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:22:43.350 --> 05:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
question you've done a really good job
 
05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
of clarifying the the idea that this is
 
05:22:47.190 --> 05:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
actually a food
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's also been noted to be a dietary
 
05:22:51.750 --> 05:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
supplement what is your take on labeling
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
this as a dietary supplement
 
05:22:54.638 --> 05:22:56.230 align:start position:0%
this as a dietary supplement
so

05:22:56.230 --> 05:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
our section does not regulate
 
05:23:00.708 --> 05:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
dietary supplements those are regulated
 
05:23:03.510 --> 05:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
by the fda and
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
currently fda does not recommend this as
 
05:23:08.868 --> 05:23:08.878 align:start position:0%
a dietary dietary supplement supplement
 
05:23:13.350 --> 05:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:15.510 --> 05:23:15.520 align:start position:0%

me the opportunity to speak in support
 
05:23:42.788 --> 05:23:42.798 align:start position:0%
of house bill 333
 
05:23:44.470 --> 05:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is seamus casey
 
05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
and i live in barrington new hampshire
 
05:23:49.110 --> 05:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
unlike many of the speakers likely lined
 
05:23:50.788 --> 05:23:50.798 align:start position:0%
up today i'm not here to speak from my
 
05:23:52.948 --> 05:23:52.958 align:start position:0%
personal perspective about kratom
 
05:23:55.110 --> 05:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
as i am not a consumer of it
 
05:23:56.948 --> 05:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
i first learned about it from a personal
 
05:23:58.788 --> 05:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
account of a friend she had been in an
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
awful car accident and was prescribed
 
05:24:03.350 --> 05:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
some some form of opiate pain reliever
 
05:24:04.948 --> 05:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
by her doctor
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
the side effects of this prescription
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
were debilitating greatly reducing her
 
05:24:11.990 --> 05:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
quality of life fortunately for her her
 
05:24:14.230 --> 05:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
doctor had another suggestion that she
 
05:24:16.948 --> 05:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
looked into kratom for the pain relief
 
05:24:18.708 --> 05:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
she did and because of this her quality
 
05:24:20.230 --> 05:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
of life is restored
 
05:24:22.070 --> 05:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
and as with her sharing her personal
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
story that put kratom on my radar like
 
05:24:26.470 --> 05:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
many of you i had not heard of it prior
 
05:24:28.470 --> 05:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
to that
 
05:24:29.990 --> 05:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
some of you might know me as the
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
developer of a legislative tracking
 
05:24:33.190 --> 05:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
system here in new hampshire it was
 
05:24:35.190 --> 05:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
through that and due to my friend having
 
05:24:36.628 --> 05:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned kratom that i have found
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
myself as an advocate for it here in new
 
05:24:38.798 --> 05:24:39.830 align:start position:0%
myself as an advocate for it here in new
hampshire

05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:24:41.910 --> 05:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
and now over the past five years i have
 
05:24:43.670 --> 05:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
led the effort to block multiple
 
05:24:46.150 --> 05:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
attempted bans so this is to address a
 
05:24:48.390 --> 05:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
question earlier about
 
05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
why aren't we talking about it we have
 
05:24:52.310 --> 05:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
and a number of times and i'll give a
 
05:24:54.708 --> 05:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
quick summary of that here
 
05:24:57.190 --> 05:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh the first was in january
 
05:24:59.110 --> 05:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
of 2016.
 
05:25:01.750 --> 05:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 540 sponsored by then
 
05:25:04.550 --> 05:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
senator fuller clark was introduced as
 
05:25:06.628 --> 05:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the possession use or sale
 
05:25:08.230 --> 05:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
of kratom
 
05:25:10.230 --> 05:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
five years ago to this very day the
 
05:25:11.350 --> 05:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
senate health and human services
 
05:25:13.510 --> 05:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
committee held a hearing for the bill we
 
05:25:15.990 --> 05:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
had about 40 people show up in support
 
05:25:18.230 --> 05:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
for the hearing where then chairman
 
05:25:20.070 --> 05:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
sanborn very graciously made the time
 
05:25:22.310 --> 05:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
for all to speak during the hearing he
 
05:25:24.150 --> 05:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
expressed concerns that the bill would
 
05:25:26.708 --> 05:25:26.718 align:start position:0%
quote trample civil liberties
 
05:25:28.550 --> 05:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
the committee unanimously recommended
 
05:25:30.390 --> 05:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
the bill be amended replacing it with
 
05:25:32.470 --> 05:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
language that would simply require one
 
05:25:35.110 --> 05:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
to be 18 or older whereas current there
 
05:25:37.510 --> 05:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
is no statute or requirement of that in
 
05:25:39.270 --> 05:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
the state now
 
05:25:41.110 --> 05:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment was adopted and passed on
 
05:25:43.510 --> 05:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
a voice vote the house criminal justice
 
05:25:45.030 --> 05:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
and public safety committee soon
 
05:25:47.750 --> 05:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
thereafter also recommended passage but
 
05:25:49.590 --> 05:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
then a house floor motion to table it
 
05:25:51.430 --> 05:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
was adopted the bill then died on the
 
05:25:51.440 --> 05:25:52.550 align:start position:0%
was adopted the bill then died on the
table

05:25:52.550 --> 05:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
table
 
05:25:57.110 --> 05:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
in late 2016 i saw an lsr for 2017 lsr
 
05:25:59.750 --> 05:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
number 78 titled prohibiting the sale or
 
05:26:02.788 --> 05:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
use of kratom filed by rep massimilia
 
05:26:04.390 --> 05:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
i reached out to her explaining the
 
05:26:06.550 --> 05:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
recent history with senate bill 540 and
 
05:26:07.990 --> 05:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
asked that she considered withdrawing
 
05:26:10.708 --> 05:26:10.718 align:start position:0%
the lsr and she did
 
05:26:13.750 --> 05:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
a year ago last week then senator feltes
 
05:26:16.230 --> 05:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
introduced senate bill 758 titled
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
relative to bannon kratom
 
05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
on march 3rd the senate health and human
 
05:26:21.990 --> 05:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
services committee held a hearing for
 
05:26:24.150 --> 05:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
the bill to his credit senator feltes
 
05:26:25.830 --> 05:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
responded to pressure from crowd of
 
05:26:28.310 --> 05:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
consumers and showed up at the hearing
 
05:26:30.628 --> 05:26:30.638 align:start position:0%
with an amendment in hand that amendment
 
05:26:32.390 --> 05:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
was an earlier version of the bill we
 
05:26:34.470 --> 05:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
have before us today the crime consumer
 
05:26:35.910 --> 05:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
05:26:37.910 --> 05:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
i was in contact with some of the senate
 
05:26:39.110 --> 05:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
health and human services committee
 
05:26:40.708 --> 05:26:40.718 align:start position:0%
members and also with the governor's
 
05:26:43.110 --> 05:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
office about taking this very action so
 
05:26:44.470 --> 05:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
it was quite relieving to see the
 
05:26:46.470 --> 05:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor come around to the to the idea
 
05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:26:49.670 --> 05:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
i mentioned the governor as he and i
 
05:26:51.030 --> 05:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
have had a conversation about the crowd
 
05:26:52.550 --> 05:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
and consumer protection act back in
 
05:26:55.030 --> 05:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
september of 2019
 
05:26:56.948 --> 05:26:56.958 align:start position:0%
he was impressed with the list of of
 
05:26:58.150 --> 05:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
other gov
 
05:26:59.910 --> 05:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
of other governors who have signed into
 
05:27:01.830 --> 05:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
law which at the time included the
 
05:27:04.230 --> 05:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
states of utah georgia arizona and
 
05:27:04.240 --> 05:27:05.350 align:start position:0%
states of utah georgia arizona and
nevada

05:27:05.350 --> 05:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
nevada
 
05:27:07.030 --> 05:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
per our conversation he seemed very
 
05:27:08.868 --> 05:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
receptive to the idea
 
05:27:11.270 --> 05:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
but back to seven uh sent to me senate
 
05:27:12.868 --> 05:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
bill 758
 
05:27:14.708 --> 05:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
the hhs committee unanimously
 
05:27:16.550 --> 05:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
recommended the amendment to replace the
 
05:27:18.310 --> 05:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
bill with the credit consumer protection
 
05:27:20.550 --> 05:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
act the amendment was adopted and passed
 
05:27:23.990 --> 05:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
on a voice vote but then covet happened
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
the bill was stalled until the senate
 
05:27:27.430 --> 05:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
had to send it to the house the house
 
05:27:29.190 --> 05:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
was forced to table it along with a
 
05:27:31.270 --> 05:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
group of other bills due to there being
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
no means to hold public hearings these
 
05:27:36.310 --> 05:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
bills all of course died on the table
 
05:27:38.788 --> 05:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
this year rather than react defensively
 
05:27:41.430 --> 05:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
to try to stop additional attempts at
 
05:27:43.030 --> 05:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
banning it i wanted to start off by
 
05:27:44.788 --> 05:27:44.798 align:start position:0%
preemptively introducing the crowd and
 
05:27:47.030 --> 05:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act and i thank my
 
05:27:48.788 --> 05:27:48.798 align:start position:0%
good friend representative nunes for
 
05:27:50.548 --> 05:27:50.558 align:start position:0%
agreeing to sponsor it
 
05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
the crime consumer protection act seeks
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
to proactively address concerns that
 
05:27:56.708 --> 05:27:56.718 align:start position:0%
prompted the past attempts at banning it
 
05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
while ensuring the the continued safe
 
05:28:02.070 --> 05:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
availability of kratom for adults
 
05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman if i may ask i would
 
05:28:06.390 --> 05:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
request that mack i'll follow up because
 
05:28:09.670 --> 05:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
he is the best suited to speak on the
 
05:28:12.150 --> 05:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
details of the kind of consumer tax of
 
05:28:14.708 --> 05:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
the kcpa and the rationale of why the
 
05:28:16.390 --> 05:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
states need to take action to protect
 
05:28:19.910 --> 05:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
consumers where the fda has failed and
 
05:28:22.310 --> 05:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
neglected their duty to do so
 
05:28:23.830 --> 05:28:23.840 align:start position:0%

05:28:41.910 --> 05:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
speak about this important legislation
 
05:28:44.310 --> 05:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
while i do not hail from new hampshire
 
05:28:46.150 --> 05:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
my wife and i raised six children and
 
05:28:48.310 --> 05:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
tried to instill in them the values of
 
05:28:50.470 --> 05:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
independence and self-reliance and i
 
05:28:51.670 --> 05:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
think that you would be proud to have
 
05:28:53.430 --> 05:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
them as citizens of your great state
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
because at least five of them have
 
05:28:56.070 --> 05:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
followed that advice for the most part
 
05:28:57.910 --> 05:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
we have one you may want to accept may
 
05:28:59.190 --> 05:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
not want to accept
 
05:29:01.990 --> 05:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
but this is a great uh occasion for us
 
05:29:03.830 --> 05:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
at the american kratom association i
 
05:29:06.070 --> 05:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
serve as the senior fellow in public
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
policy and i've testified at more than
 
05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
well dozens of hearings across the
 
05:29:12.548 --> 05:29:12.558 align:start position:0%
country and states and i have heard
 
05:29:14.708 --> 05:29:14.718 align:start position:0%
similar kinds of questions that have
 
05:29:16.470 --> 05:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
been raised and in fact have heard some
 
05:29:18.868 --> 05:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
of the comments that miss smith uh
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
reflected and and we are glad to work
 
05:29:22.788 --> 05:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
with her and her department to resolve
 
05:29:24.788 --> 05:29:24.798 align:start position:0%
some of those issues but if i could
 
05:29:26.788 --> 05:29:26.798 align:start position:0%
reference first the written testimony
 
05:29:28.948 --> 05:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
and i hope each of you will look at that
 
05:29:31.430 --> 05:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
but perhaps i could but most efficiently
 
05:29:33.510 --> 05:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
spend our time talking about some of the
 
05:29:35.030 --> 05:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
issues that have been raised in the
 
05:29:37.430 --> 05:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
question period obviously with the thing
 
05:29:39.430 --> 05:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplish with the
 
05:29:41.270 --> 05:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
kratom consumer protection act is to
 
05:29:44.070 --> 05:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
provide protections for consumers from
 
05:29:46.390 --> 05:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous vendors in the united
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
states who will adulterate the product
 
05:29:50.708 --> 05:29:50.718 align:start position:0%
in order to get it to do something it
 
05:29:53.270 --> 05:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
does not do kratom does not have a
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
reinforcing high that would drive people
 
05:29:57.830 --> 05:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
to an addiction or to continue to
 
05:29:59.990 --> 05:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
purchase their product and so some of
 
05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
these vendors will add things like
 
05:30:04.548 --> 05:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
heroin fentanyl and morphine in order to
 
05:30:06.868 --> 05:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
induce that to increase their sales it
 
05:30:09.430 --> 05:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
is done widely in the united states we
 
05:30:11.270 --> 05:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
have found in the four states that have
 
05:30:13.110 --> 05:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
enacted the kratom consumer protection
 
05:30:15.190 --> 05:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
act a substantial reduction in the
 
05:30:17.350 --> 05:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
number of those adulterated products
 
05:30:19.590 --> 05:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
available on the store shelves for
 
05:30:21.510 --> 05:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
consumers because these unscrupulous
 
05:30:23.670 --> 05:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
vendors do not want to run afoul of the
 
05:30:25.590 --> 05:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
laws in those states and we think it
 
05:30:27.910 --> 05:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
affords a significant level protection
 
05:30:30.310 --> 05:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
for consumers we think the age limit is
 
05:30:32.548 --> 05:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
important as well uh we think that any
 
05:30:34.868 --> 05:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
decision about this kind of product
 
05:30:37.990 --> 05:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
and like tobacco or alcohol or or coffee
 
05:30:39.670 --> 05:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
even probably i'd be done with the
 
05:30:42.310 --> 05:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
advice and consent of parents
 
05:30:44.390 --> 05:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
you should know that the the taste of
 
05:30:46.230 --> 05:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
kratom is foul
 
05:30:47.830 --> 05:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
children wouldn't be drawn to it unless
 
05:30:50.310 --> 05:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
it has these adulterants in it uh
 
05:30:52.150 --> 05:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
typically it doesn't give you the
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
reinforcing high as i mentioned it also
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
does it doesn't do something that's very
 
05:30:58.868 --> 05:30:58.878 align:start position:0%
important and that is it does not impact
 
05:31:01.270 --> 05:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
your your respiratory system as
 
05:31:04.708 --> 05:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
traditional uh therapies and opioids do
 
05:31:07.670 --> 05:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
with respect to the how kratom is
 
05:31:10.070 --> 05:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
properly designated under the federal
 
05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
food drug and cosmetic act the
 
05:31:13.990 --> 05:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
classification of freight kratom as a
 
05:31:15.590 --> 05:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
food is done
 
05:31:18.150 --> 05:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
under that law and it is very specific
 
05:31:20.548 --> 05:31:20.558 align:start position:0%
and is why the aka characterizes
 
05:31:22.708 --> 05:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
it in that way the other thing that the
 
05:31:26.070 --> 05:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
fdnc act does it requires that a
 
05:31:28.230 --> 05:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of any product has to look
 
05:31:31.030 --> 05:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
at the intended use of how it's marketed
 
05:31:33.510 --> 05:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
and there is where the fda has in fact
 
05:31:36.070 --> 05:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
legitimately raised questions about some
 
05:31:38.628 --> 05:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
creative manufacturers who violate that
 
05:31:40.548 --> 05:31:40.558 align:start position:0%
law and we fully support them from being
 
05:31:42.628 --> 05:31:42.638 align:start position:0%
restricted from making any kind of
 
05:31:45.030 --> 05:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
structure function claims as a dietary
 
05:31:47.030 --> 05:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
supplement if it hasn't gone through the
 
05:31:49.030 --> 05:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
new dietary ingredient notification
 
05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
process or if they want to make
 
05:31:52.548 --> 05:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
therapeutic claims to go through the new
 
05:31:54.948 --> 05:31:54.958 align:start position:0%
drug application process but kratom
 
05:31:56.708 --> 05:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
itself is a food it is not a food
 
05:31:59.270 --> 05:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
additive it is a food itself under the
 
05:32:01.590 --> 05:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
definition of characterization under the
 
05:32:03.750 --> 05:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
food and drug act federally
 
05:32:05.510 --> 05:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
the fda has
 
05:32:07.510 --> 05:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
as they did back in the early 90s and
 
05:32:09.430 --> 05:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
some of you may remember this
 
05:32:11.270 --> 05:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
they went after vitamins and dietary
 
05:32:12.948 --> 05:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
supplements at that time with the very
 
05:32:15.750 --> 05:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
same characterizations and attacks on
 
05:32:17.830 --> 05:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
those products at the time with the
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
claims that they were killing people
 
05:32:21.350 --> 05:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
that there were an elevated number of
 
05:32:23.590 --> 05:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
reports being made about adverse events
 
05:32:25.190 --> 05:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
and that they were dangerous products
 
05:32:27.830 --> 05:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
and should be uh banned and all should
 
05:32:29.430 --> 05:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
be forced to go through the new drug
 
05:32:31.030 --> 05:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
application process
 
05:32:33.990 --> 05:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
in 1994 the congress contended with this
 
05:32:35.990 --> 05:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
issue it is the first time in the
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
history of the switchboard at the
 
05:32:39.350 --> 05:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
capitol that the capital was shut down
 
05:32:40.948 --> 05:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
this was before emails
 
05:32:42.788 --> 05:32:42.798 align:start position:0%
people called and they literally shut
 
05:32:44.390 --> 05:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
down the switchboard objecting to the
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
fda's overreach of regulatory authority
 
05:32:49.510 --> 05:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
restricting their freedoms and the the
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
ability to make informed decisions about
 
05:32:53.590 --> 05:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
the products that they make today more
 
05:32:54.948 --> 05:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
than 80 percent of the american
 
05:32:57.510 --> 05:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
population uses dietary supplements and
 
05:32:58.868 --> 05:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
vitamins in order to maintain their
 
05:33:00.868 --> 05:33:00.878 align:start position:0%
health and well-being but those very
 
05:33:02.868 --> 05:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
same attacks that they used against
 
05:33:04.390 --> 05:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
vitamins and dietary supplements were
 
05:33:06.548 --> 05:33:06.558 align:start position:0%
interdicted by the congress where they
 
05:33:08.150 --> 05:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
passed the dietary supplement health and
 
05:33:10.310 --> 05:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
education act congress the congress
 
05:33:12.150 --> 05:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
restricted the fda's authority even
 
05:33:13.990 --> 05:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
though they made the same claims then
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
against those products as they do today
 
05:33:18.788 --> 05:33:18.798 align:start position:0%
against kratom the fda is alone in
 
05:33:21.430 --> 05:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
washington dc in their attacks on kratom
 
05:33:23.590 --> 05:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
they initiated this action largely based
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
on some deaths that were reported in
 
05:33:27.990 --> 05:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
2009 where nine people died in the
 
05:33:30.868 --> 05:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
12-month period allegedly from a kratom
 
05:33:33.110 --> 05:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
product a powder crate and product sold
 
05:33:35.110 --> 05:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
on the internet that got the attention
 
05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
of every public health official in the
 
05:33:39.190 --> 05:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
world and appropriately so but what the
 
05:33:41.590 --> 05:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
fda failed to tell people after they
 
05:33:43.510 --> 05:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
imposed an import alert and starting
 
05:33:45.750 --> 05:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
filling the pipeline of information that
 
05:33:47.430 --> 05:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
led to some states to be duped into
 
05:33:48.788 --> 05:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
banning kratom
 
05:33:50.708 --> 05:33:50.718 align:start position:0%
was that the kratom was dangerous it was
 
05:33:52.628 --> 05:33:52.638 align:start position:0%
killing people they didn't tell that
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
there was a scientific paper
 
05:33:55.990 --> 05:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed and published that looked
 
05:33:58.070 --> 05:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
at all nine of those deaths and every
 
05:33:59.910 --> 05:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
one was the result of an adulterant
 
05:34:02.470 --> 05:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
called odes methyl tramadol which is the
 
05:34:04.628 --> 05:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
powerful uh chemical that's used in the
 
05:34:06.548 --> 05:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
production of the opioid tranvidol the
 
05:34:08.628 --> 05:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
same dose of which was added to a cup of
 
05:34:10.150 --> 05:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
coffee in the morning or glass of orange
 
05:34:12.230 --> 05:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
juice would kill you within minutes
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
kratom was not the culprit here but the
 
05:34:15.990 --> 05:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
fda withheld that information and did
 
05:34:18.708 --> 05:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
not disclose it similarly when they made
 
05:34:19.910 --> 05:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
their application to the drug
 
05:34:22.628 --> 05:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement administration on october 17
 
05:34:25.670 --> 05:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
of 19 2017
 
05:34:28.470 --> 05:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
they they successfully got the dea to
 
05:34:31.750 --> 05:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
consider scheduling kratom but they have
 
05:34:33.270 --> 05:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
not disclosed for the past two and a
 
05:34:35.910 --> 05:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
half years that on august the 16th of
 
05:34:38.470 --> 05:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
2018 the department of health and human
 
05:34:40.948 --> 05:34:40.958 align:start position:0%
services which is the official designee
 
05:34:42.948 --> 05:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
to transmit such recommendations for
 
05:34:45.990 --> 05:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
scheduling rescinded that application
 
05:34:48.310 --> 05:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
for scheduling and specifically called
 
05:34:50.628 --> 05:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
out the fda for failing to document by
 
05:34:52.628 --> 05:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
the science the requirements for
 
05:34:54.788 --> 05:34:54.798 align:start position:0%
scheduling and made a very interesting
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
point which i think is relevant to your
 
05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
discussion the secretary the assistant
 
05:34:59.750 --> 05:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
secretary of health said that
 
05:35:01.910 --> 05:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore there is a significant risk
 
05:35:03.510 --> 05:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
of immediate adverse public health
 
05:35:05.750 --> 05:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
consequences for potentially millions of
 
05:35:07.670 --> 05:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
users of creating words components are
 
05:35:09.910 --> 05:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
included in schedule one now the reason
 
05:35:11.750 --> 05:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
he he did that is because there are a
 
05:35:13.270 --> 05:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
number of people who are successfully
 
05:35:15.590 --> 05:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
using kratom as an option to and
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
replacement for opioids a johns hopkins
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
university study of adult kratom users
 
05:35:22.708 --> 05:35:22.718 align:start position:0%
who use kratom for managing acute and
 
05:35:25.990 --> 05:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
chronic pain reported that 87 percent of
 
05:35:28.150 --> 05:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
those people using opioids using kratom
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
to get off of those opioids reported
 
05:35:32.470 --> 05:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
significant relief from their withdrawal
 
05:35:32.480 --> 05:35:33.430 align:start position:0%
significant relief from their withdrawal
symptoms

05:35:33.430 --> 05:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
symptoms
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
35 percent were opioid free within a
 
05:35:39.190 --> 05:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
year now that is a a product that is
 
05:35:40.548 --> 05:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
harm reduction that ought to be
 
05:35:42.948 --> 05:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
celebrated not restricted but again it
 
05:35:45.110 --> 05:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
goes to the intended use and the
 
05:35:47.110 --> 05:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
individual that seeks to have that kind
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
of relief as a less harmful substance
 
05:35:51.750 --> 05:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
ought to have the freedom to make that
 
05:35:53.910 --> 05:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
choice not that a vendor should be able
 
05:35:55.670 --> 05:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
to make the claim about that because
 
05:35:57.910 --> 05:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
obviously that contradicts what is known
 
05:36:00.310 --> 05:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
in the what is required for a new drug
 
05:36:02.230 --> 05:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
application so the american kratom
 
05:36:04.948 --> 05:36:04.958 align:start position:0%
association seeks to provide an access
 
05:36:07.030 --> 05:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
point for consumers to make informed
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
decisions which is why labeling is asked
 
05:36:11.670 --> 05:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
for in this particular legislation it is
 
05:36:14.070 --> 05:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
why it is characterized as a food under
 
05:36:16.470 --> 05:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
the food drug and cosmetic act and it is
 
05:36:19.430 --> 05:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
why the fda's attacks on kratom really
 
05:36:20.708 --> 05:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
should be replaced with a good
 
05:36:22.708 --> 05:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
regulatory scheme which we think that
 
05:36:25.110 --> 05:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
they will eventually get to the fda does
 
05:36:27.030 --> 05:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
today appropriately regulate kratom
 
05:36:29.270 --> 05:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
products that are mislabeled and we
 
05:36:31.670 --> 05:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
support them in fact we report regularly
 
05:36:33.590 --> 05:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
those creative manufacturers who are
 
05:36:36.070 --> 05:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
using therapeutic claims inappropriately
 
05:36:38.948 --> 05:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
they also are willing to respond to any
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
adverse events and we support that as
 
05:36:43.110 --> 05:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
well largely those adverse events are
 
05:36:45.430 --> 05:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
because of what we see with adulterated
 
05:36:48.230 --> 05:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
kratom products that it is you cannot be
 
05:36:50.310 --> 05:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
addicted to kratom in the classical
 
05:36:52.390 --> 05:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
sense as you would expect for opioids
 
05:36:53.910 --> 05:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
the national institutes on drug abuse
 
05:36:56.310 --> 05:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
conducted two independent animal studies
 
05:36:57.830 --> 05:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
which are the gold standard prediction
 
05:36:59.670 --> 05:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
liability one of the requirements for
 
05:37:00.788 --> 05:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
scheduling under the controlled
 
05:37:02.868 --> 05:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
substances act and they determined two
 
05:37:04.390 --> 05:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
things one there was no significant
 
05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
addiction liability therefore uh the
 
05:37:09.030 --> 05:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
fda's claim failed but they also
 
05:37:10.628 --> 05:37:10.638 align:start position:0%
reported there was a significant
 
05:37:12.470 --> 05:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
reduction in the cravings of the test
 
05:37:14.548 --> 05:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
animals for the reference drug which was
 
05:37:17.110 --> 05:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
morphine which validates why the new
 
05:37:19.190 --> 05:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
national drug institutes on drug abuse
 
05:37:21.990 --> 05:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
today supports the aka's position they
 
05:37:23.670 --> 05:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
funded more than 15 million dollars in
 
05:37:25.750 --> 05:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
studies into kratom and why the us
 
05:37:29.110 --> 05:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
congress in the fy 20 and 21 legislation
 
05:37:30.788 --> 05:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
reports that kratom should not be
 
05:37:32.470 --> 05:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
scheduled and in fact should be studied
 
05:37:34.470 --> 05:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
more and available to the public because
 
05:37:35.910 --> 05:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
of all the reports they're having of
 
05:37:37.830 --> 05:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
people that are benefiting from it
 
05:37:40.070 --> 05:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
i know that you will hear a lot of the
 
05:37:42.470 --> 05:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
hyped-up anti-creative information that
 
05:37:44.868 --> 05:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
is generated by the fda but in our
 
05:37:46.788 --> 05:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
research and all of our studies we have
 
05:37:48.070 --> 05:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
found that that is the result of
 
05:37:50.230 --> 05:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
adulterated products that should not be
 
05:37:51.910 --> 05:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
on the marketplace and why this bill is
 
05:37:53.910 --> 05:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
so important given the failure of the
 
05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
fda to enforce the laws that they should
 
05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
be enforcing but of those four states
 
05:38:00.070 --> 05:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
that have already passed it we've seen
 
05:38:01.590 --> 05:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
because of covet we had obviously a
 
05:38:03.110 --> 05:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
disaster in the legislative solutions
 
05:38:05.030 --> 05:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
sessions last year but this year we've
 
05:38:07.190 --> 05:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
already seen significant progress the
 
05:38:08.868 --> 05:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
missouri house of representatives passed
 
05:38:11.590 --> 05:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
the kratom consumer protection act 144
 
05:38:14.628 --> 05:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
to zero in oklahoma the committee passed
 
05:38:17.430 --> 05:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
it out unanimously in wisconsin the
 
05:38:19.430 --> 05:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
wisconsin senate health committee passed
 
05:38:21.190 --> 05:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
unanimously opened a bill foul
 
05:38:23.030 --> 05:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
unanimously in order to replace their
 
05:38:24.788 --> 05:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
ban with a kratom consumer protection
 
05:38:26.788 --> 05:38:26.798 align:start position:0%
act in the rhode island the public
 
05:38:28.470 --> 05:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
health commissioner has opened a formal
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
review of kratom and to replace the
 
05:38:33.110 --> 05:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
ban there with a kratom consumer
 
05:38:34.628 --> 05:38:34.638 align:start position:0%
protection act because they are becoming
 
05:38:36.708 --> 05:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
informed about the misinformation that
 
05:38:38.470 --> 05:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
the fda has provided and that is
 
05:38:41.350 --> 05:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
validated by the august 16 2018 letter
 
05:38:43.510 --> 05:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
recently disclosed which attacks the
 
05:38:45.430 --> 05:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
premise of the fda so we want to work
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
with you and we'll certainly work with
 
05:38:48.548 --> 05:38:48.558 align:start position:0%
the food protection section of your
 
05:38:51.430 --> 05:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
state government agencies in order to
 
05:38:53.910 --> 05:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
come to a a good
 
05:38:55.430 --> 05:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory scheme that they'll be
 
05:38:56.948 --> 05:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it's working in other
 
05:38:58.548 --> 05:38:58.558 align:start position:0%
states and we think it'll work in new
 
05:39:00.390 --> 05:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire so with that i thank you for
 
05:39:01.990 --> 05:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
this opportunity and certainly willing
 
05:39:04.628 --> 05:39:04.638 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions you might have
 
05:39:06.230 --> 05:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh we do have some questions
 
05:39:09.030 --> 05:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative abramson has a question
 
05:39:11.590 --> 05:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you uh
 
05:39:15.350 --> 05:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
mr hatto for for that testimony um so
 
05:39:16.708 --> 05:39:16.718 align:start position:0%
this is the same question i asked the
 
05:39:19.350 --> 05:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor it was it your intent
 
05:39:19.360 --> 05:39:20.708 align:start position:0%
sponsor it was it your intent
um

05:39:20.708 --> 05:39:20.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:22.948 --> 05:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
for the uh when you're the seller you
 
05:39:24.788 --> 05:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
have a common law duty to disclose or
 
05:39:27.510 --> 05:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
common law duty to notify is that your
 
05:39:29.830 --> 05:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
your preference or intent on the
 
05:39:31.590 --> 05:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
labeling the labeling of the product
 
05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
when it's sold
 
05:39:35.030 --> 05:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
that we have some type of statutory
 
05:39:37.030 --> 05:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
scheme added to the bill or was it your
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
preference that we simply fall back on
 
05:39:39.910 --> 05:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
the old uh
 
05:39:42.868 --> 05:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
common law or or some other approach
 
05:39:45.270 --> 05:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
well we would defer
 
05:39:46.948 --> 05:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
representative abramson to the new
 
05:39:49.030 --> 05:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire preference on this uh other
 
05:39:51.430 --> 05:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
states have required specific labeling
 
05:39:52.948 --> 05:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
of the contents of the product and we
 
05:39:54.310 --> 05:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
certainly support that what we're
 
05:39:56.948 --> 05:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
finding is that the legitimate vendors
 
05:39:58.628 --> 05:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
are labeling it to the strictest
 
05:40:00.628 --> 05:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
standard and so we're seeing a great
 
05:40:02.230 --> 05:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
transformation in the kratom industry
 
05:40:04.150 --> 05:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's very beneficial for consumers
 
05:40:05.670 --> 05:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
where we're seeing accurate labeling
 
05:40:07.590 --> 05:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
being applied to kratom products because
 
05:40:09.510 --> 05:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
they're having to market them in a lot
 
05:40:11.270 --> 05:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
of states now and and there's no reason
 
05:40:13.190 --> 05:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
to have multiple labels unless you're a
 
05:40:15.110 --> 05:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
bad actor and those of course the
 
05:40:16.628 --> 05:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
manufacturers we would like to eliminate
 
05:40:18.470 --> 05:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
but we're not opposed in any way in fact
 
05:40:20.628 --> 05:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
we favor labeling that requires full
 
05:40:21.990 --> 05:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
disclosure of the ingredients of the
 
05:40:24.470 --> 05:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
product and that accurately portray the
 
05:40:26.628 --> 05:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
contents of a kratom product that is
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
sold in your state all right thank you
 
05:40:29.990 --> 05:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative van halen
 
05:40:33.590 --> 05:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you sir for your
 
05:40:35.830 --> 05:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
testimony uh i'd like to go right back
 
05:40:37.910 --> 05:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the very basic question that i asked
 
05:40:40.230 --> 05:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
a bit earlier to the sponsor is this
 
05:40:40.240 --> 05:40:41.270 align:start position:0%
a bit earlier to the sponsor is this
legal

05:40:41.270 --> 05:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
legal
 
05:40:43.350 --> 05:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
and if it is legal where
 
05:40:45.590 --> 05:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
and if not are we looking at a backdoor
 
05:40:48.070 --> 05:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
effort to legalize it by overlooking the
 
05:40:50.548 --> 05:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
fact that it's never been legalized
 
05:40:52.548 --> 05:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative
 
05:40:55.990 --> 05:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
it is today as coffee is legal in every
 
05:40:59.350 --> 05:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
state except for six that were initially
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
misled by the fda about the safety
 
05:41:03.670 --> 05:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
profile of kratom which has been
 
05:41:07.350 --> 05:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
completely debunked by the hhs letter of
 
05:41:09.910 --> 05:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
of august 16 2018 which i would refer
 
05:41:11.350 --> 05:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
you to read
 
05:41:13.030 --> 05:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
that safety data reflects only
 
05:41:15.750 --> 05:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
adulterated products the deaths every
 
05:41:17.510 --> 05:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
death that's attributable to a craving
 
05:41:20.230 --> 05:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
that the fda cites is actually because
 
05:41:22.390 --> 05:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
of poly drug use or adulterated kratom
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
products uh there were two that did not
 
05:41:26.868 --> 05:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
have blood samples uh that no one was
 
05:41:28.310 --> 05:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
able to test but the national institute
 
05:41:29.910 --> 05:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
institutes on drug abuse did their own
 
05:41:32.070 --> 05:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation came to the conclusion that i
 
05:41:34.310 --> 05:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
just articulated so from
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
from a legal basis kratom is sold
 
05:41:38.948 --> 05:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
legally and in three of the six states
 
05:41:40.628 --> 05:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
that banned it they're now
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully going to overturn those this
 
05:41:42.000 --> 05:41:42.788 align:start position:0%
hopefully going to overturn those this
year

05:41:42.788 --> 05:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:41:44.548 --> 05:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
and we think eventually all of them will
 
05:41:47.190 --> 05:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
follow suit but the four states that
 
05:41:48.230 --> 05:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
have passed the kratom consumer
 
05:41:49.990 --> 05:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
protection act simply put in a good
 
05:41:51.830 --> 05:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
regulatory scheme to eliminate
 
05:41:53.670 --> 05:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
adulterated products we're hoping to do
 
05:41:55.830 --> 05:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
that in about we have it active in 30
 
05:41:57.510 --> 05:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
states this year including new hampshire
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
so we're hopeful that we'll get many
 
05:42:00.788 --> 05:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
more states following suit
 
05:42:04.548 --> 05:42:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:10.628 --> 05:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
i apologize uh thank you for that and
 
05:42:12.948 --> 05:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
for that explanation uh is new hampshire
 
05:42:14.470 --> 05:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
one of the six states in which this is
 
05:42:15.670 --> 05:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
not legal
 
05:42:15.680 --> 05:42:16.390 align:start position:0%
not legal
no

05:42:16.390 --> 05:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:42:18.230 --> 05:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
it is legal to be sold the six states
 
05:42:22.708 --> 05:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
are alabama arkansas indiana wisconsin
 
05:42:24.330 --> 05:42:24.340 align:start position:0%
rhode island and vermont
 
05:42:24.340 --> 05:42:26.310 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:42:26.310 --> 05:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:42:28.390 --> 05:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
i have heard that the town of franklin
 
05:42:30.310 --> 05:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
has banned it
 
05:42:32.948 --> 05:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you when you say legal legal
 
05:42:38.548 --> 05:42:38.558 align:start position:0%
for sale legal for use could you clarify
 
05:42:41.350 --> 05:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
the term legal for me please possession
 
05:42:42.708 --> 05:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you there's the three
 
05:42:45.270 --> 05:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
criteria uh it is legal in the united
 
05:42:46.948 --> 05:42:46.958 align:start position:0%
states except for those six states and
 
05:42:49.110 --> 05:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
those six states have varying uh degrees
 
05:42:50.788 --> 05:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
of whether it's legal for possession or
 
05:42:52.070 --> 05:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
use or sale
 
05:42:54.310 --> 05:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
it is legal in the united states for
 
05:42:59.110 --> 05:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
sale uh it is legal for um for the use
 
05:43:01.750 --> 05:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
in virtually every state and possession
 
05:43:03.590 --> 05:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
i think in four of the six states it's
 
05:43:06.150 --> 05:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
banned alabama's the toughest of those
 
05:43:08.070 --> 05:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
states and i think it's illegal for
 
05:43:10.390 --> 05:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
possession use or sale in the
 
05:43:11.350 --> 05:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
in those
 
05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
05:43:18.868 --> 05:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:43:20.230 --> 05:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:43:22.868 --> 05:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
do physicians prescribe
 
05:43:25.510 --> 05:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
this product kratom
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
no physicians uh would
 
05:43:29.670 --> 05:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a prescription medication and
 
05:43:31.030 --> 05:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
until and if
 
05:43:33.590 --> 05:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
kratom a kratom product were either
 
05:43:35.670 --> 05:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
synthesized or approved by the the food
 
05:43:37.270 --> 05:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
and drug administration as a
 
05:43:39.270 --> 05:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
prescription product it would not be uh
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
but interestingly in the survey that was
 
05:43:43.110 --> 05:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
done of kratom consumers in the united
 
05:43:45.590 --> 05:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
states of which there are 15 million
 
05:43:47.990 --> 05:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
40 reported that they consult with their
 
05:43:50.548 --> 05:43:50.558 align:start position:0%
physician about using kratom we think
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
that number would go up dramatically if
 
05:43:54.470 --> 05:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
the fda didn't have this sort of onus
 
05:43:55.830 --> 05:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
that they put on it
 
05:43:58.390 --> 05:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
and allow for a more accurate depiction
 
05:43:59.910 --> 05:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
of the kratom product but we're
 
05:44:01.430 --> 05:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
encouraged that so many people are
 
05:44:03.350 --> 05:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
consulting their doctors as they use it
 
05:44:05.830 --> 05:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
particularly for for pain relief uh
 
05:44:07.910 --> 05:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
certainly the people use it for the the
 
05:44:10.310 --> 05:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh the energy boost uh and increase
 
05:44:12.150 --> 05:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
focus about a third of the population of
 
05:44:14.310 --> 05:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
the 15 million do it for that third use
 
05:44:16.230 --> 05:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
it for reducing anxiety and then that
 
05:44:17.590 --> 05:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
other third use it for management and
 
05:44:19.350 --> 05:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
pain and we think in that care the
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
category checking with your physician is
 
05:44:21.120 --> 05:44:22.548 align:start position:0%
category checking with your physician is
important

05:44:22.548 --> 05:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:44:24.470 --> 05:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
how about a follow-up yeah i was gonna
 
05:44:26.948 --> 05:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
say how about natural pass
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
natural password
 
05:44:29.990 --> 05:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
they love it i mean this is this is in
 
05:44:32.548 --> 05:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
their wheelhouse and we have a strong
 
05:44:34.948 --> 05:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
support from that community because it's
 
05:44:36.948 --> 05:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
one of the tools that can effectively be
 
05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
used uh in the plant community to help
 
05:44:41.270 --> 05:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
people improve the quality of their
 
05:44:43.670 --> 05:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
lives and manage their symptoms so could
 
05:44:45.990 --> 05:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
someone purchase it as a homeopathic
 
05:44:47.750 --> 05:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
medic medicine
 
05:44:50.070 --> 05:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
yeah there's as you know uh chairman
 
05:44:51.830 --> 05:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
hunt there's a categorization for
 
05:44:54.470 --> 05:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
homeopathic remedies
 
05:44:56.150 --> 05:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
right now the fda doesn't classify it
 
05:44:58.948 --> 05:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
that way but it is considered an herbal
 
05:45:00.868 --> 05:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
product so yes it could be a homeopathic
 
05:45:03.430 --> 05:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
remedy okay go ahead representative
 
05:45:05.830 --> 05:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair uh do you know
 
05:45:08.470 --> 05:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
if this is sold on the black market oh
 
05:45:11.830 --> 05:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
yes but not not the pure kratom it's the
 
05:45:13.670 --> 05:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
adulterated kratom products and that's
 
05:45:16.070 --> 05:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what uh one of the leading
 
05:45:17.910 --> 05:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
scientists in the world addressed that
 
05:45:20.150 --> 05:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
issue when he submitted an eight factor
 
05:45:21.510 --> 05:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
analysis to the drug enforcement
 
05:45:24.070 --> 05:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
administration that said that if you ban
 
05:45:27.110 --> 05:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
kratom this was back in 2016 if you ban
 
05:45:29.590 --> 05:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
kratom you will you will strengthen the
 
05:45:31.750 --> 05:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
black market where adulterated products
 
05:45:35.190 --> 05:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
flourish if people have access to
 
05:45:36.788 --> 05:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
a pure kratom product that's
 
05:45:38.470 --> 05:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
legitimately sold in your state they're
 
05:45:40.708 --> 05:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
safer and here's here's the important
 
05:45:43.270 --> 05:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
issue on that uh many people purchase
 
05:45:44.788 --> 05:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
kratom and they don't know it's
 
05:45:47.270 --> 05:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
adulterated and i hear reports of people
 
05:45:50.150 --> 05:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
say oh it it made me feel really really
 
05:45:52.788 --> 05:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
good for about six hours and i felt this
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
euphoric high that is an adulterated
 
05:45:56.708 --> 05:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
craving product but they thought they
 
05:45:58.868 --> 05:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
were buying a pure kratom product that's
 
05:46:00.470 --> 05:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
what we want to eliminate as best we can
 
05:46:04.390 --> 05:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
from the supply chain
 
05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:12.150 --> 05:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um you had
 
05:46:13.750 --> 05:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned a letter from
 
05:46:16.788 --> 05:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
um hhs could you provide a copy of that
 
05:46:20.070 --> 05:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
for us yes i sent a copy to everyone but
 
05:46:22.230 --> 05:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
i'll do it again i might no if you sent
 
05:46:25.190 --> 05:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
it i uh that's fine i i didn't see it
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
but thank you yeah and let me just tell
 
05:46:28.470 --> 05:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
you one thing about this letter when you
 
05:46:31.030 --> 05:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
look at it we have scoured the records
 
05:46:33.590 --> 05:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
this is the first time in the history of
 
05:46:36.070 --> 05:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
the of the controlled substances act in
 
05:46:37.270 --> 05:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government that there has
 
05:46:39.910 --> 05:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
ever been a withdrawal or recession
 
05:46:42.070 --> 05:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
letter sent to the dea withdrawing a
 
05:46:44.470 --> 05:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation first time and and that's
 
05:46:46.628 --> 05:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
really significant because the hhs
 
05:46:47.990 --> 05:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
assistant secretary of health really
 
05:46:49.350 --> 05:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
looked at this looked at the science and
 
05:46:51.030 --> 05:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
found the fda was wrong wrong on the
 
05:46:52.708 --> 05:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
policy and wrong on the science and
 
05:46:55.510 --> 05:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's articulated in his letter
 
05:46:57.670 --> 05:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
and the fda kept it secret for two and a
 
05:47:00.230 --> 05:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
half years so they could continue to uh
 
05:47:02.310 --> 05:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
to put out their disinformation campaign
 
05:47:04.230 --> 05:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
the day after this letter was sent to
 
05:47:06.628 --> 05:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
the dea the fda commissioner was
 
05:47:09.110 --> 05:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
tweeting about kratom being dangerous
 
05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
and yet that was contraindicated by the
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
letter and the judgment of the science
 
05:47:14.548 --> 05:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
done by the assistant secretary for
 
05:47:14.558 --> 05:47:17.590 align:start position:0%
done by the assistant secretary for
health

05:47:17.590 --> 05:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:20.868 --> 05:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions um
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
so mr i'm confused
 
05:47:24.240 --> 05:47:26.548 align:start position:0%
so mr i'm confused
um

05:47:26.548 --> 05:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:30.230 --> 05:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
why are you asking us to ban not having
 
05:47:33.030 --> 05:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
sales to anyone under 18 if there's
 
05:47:35.430 --> 05:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with this stuff
 
05:47:38.070 --> 05:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
well this to us the important thing is
 
05:47:39.430 --> 05:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
that a child
 
05:47:40.628 --> 05:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
should make a decision with their
 
05:47:42.868 --> 05:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
parents because if they take a lot of
 
05:47:45.030 --> 05:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
kratom if they were to buy it and not
 
05:47:47.670 --> 05:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
responsibly use it and we believe that
 
05:47:49.270 --> 05:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
everyone should do use kratom
 
05:47:51.270 --> 05:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
responsibly as they would any other it's
 
05:47:53.110 --> 05:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
like aspirin was mentioned earlier if
 
05:47:54.548 --> 05:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
you get a whole cough syrup as another
 
05:47:57.110 --> 05:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
one kids do things that sometimes are
 
05:47:59.750 --> 05:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
dumb and so we think that having the
 
05:48:02.708 --> 05:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
parents having a say in how much kratom
 
05:48:04.788 --> 05:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
a kid could use there's no study that
 
05:48:06.390 --> 05:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
shows that kratom is dangerous to kids
 
05:48:08.470 --> 05:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
kids don't like it because unless it's
 
05:48:10.948 --> 05:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
adulterated because of its taste um and
 
05:48:12.628 --> 05:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
so all of that but we just think it's an
 
05:48:15.190 --> 05:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate restriction that makes sure
 
05:48:16.628 --> 05:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
that parents are participating in those
 
05:48:16.638 --> 05:48:17.990 align:start position:0%
that parents are participating in those
decisions

05:48:17.990 --> 05:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
so are you saying to me that that
 
05:48:22.548 --> 05:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
that a pharmacy cannot sell cough
 
05:48:25.110 --> 05:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
medicine to kids
 
05:48:27.030 --> 05:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't know what the law is in new
 
05:48:30.470 --> 05:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh with respect to that but my
 
05:48:32.948 --> 05:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
i think that if if my child were buying
 
05:48:34.788 --> 05:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
cough medicine at a pharmacy or at a
 
05:48:36.628 --> 05:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
grocery store with a pharmacy section
 
05:48:38.230 --> 05:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
i'd want to participate in that decision
 
05:48:39.990 --> 05:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's my personal i understand that but
 
05:48:42.390 --> 05:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
but you're it just seems so weird that
 
05:48:44.470 --> 05:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
you put this 18 you're you're making
 
05:48:46.868 --> 05:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
this case that you know well it could be
 
05:48:48.390 --> 05:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
it can be uh
 
05:48:51.350 --> 05:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
some it's not really a drug it's a food
 
05:48:54.070 --> 05:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
and uh the only food products that we
 
05:48:56.070 --> 05:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
we require 18 year olds are the ones
 
05:48:59.830 --> 05:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
that are cigarettes and alcohol and and
 
05:49:01.830 --> 05:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
then we have a whole elaborate structure
 
05:49:05.510 --> 05:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
to how to regulate that industry and
 
05:49:08.390 --> 05:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
and we have no system to regulate kratom
 
05:49:09.910 --> 05:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
right we have nobody in the state who's
 
05:49:10.868 --> 05:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
going to know
 
05:49:13.270 --> 05:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
what's altered creative and what's not
 
05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
and so we really can't regulate that but
 
05:49:17.750 --> 05:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
yet you're going to say but but we're
 
05:49:19.110 --> 05:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
going to have some kind of regulation
 
05:49:21.190 --> 05:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
about selling it to someone under 18
 
05:49:24.470 --> 05:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
which we have you know we have this well
 
05:49:25.910 --> 05:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
our whole liquor commission is built
 
05:49:28.390 --> 05:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
around ensuring that that certainly you
 
05:49:31.430 --> 05:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
know under 21 and it's 21 not 18 by the
 
05:49:31.440 --> 05:49:32.788 align:start position:0%
know under 21 and it's 21 not 18 by the
way

05:49:32.788 --> 05:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:49:35.110 --> 05:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
so i just it seems really confusing to
 
05:49:37.910 --> 05:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
me that that it sounds like you do admit
 
05:49:40.390 --> 05:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
that this product can be abused
 
05:49:43.270 --> 05:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
and really should be regulated
 
05:49:43.280 --> 05:49:44.070 align:start position:0%
and really should be regulated
well

05:49:44.070 --> 05:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:49:46.230 --> 05:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
there's no question that kratom like
 
05:49:47.590 --> 05:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
many other
 
05:49:49.990 --> 05:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
substances that are freely available to
 
05:49:52.230 --> 05:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
consumers can be abused we don't have
 
05:49:53.430 --> 05:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
any doubt about that you would have to
 
05:49:56.150 --> 05:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
consume a lot now the one thing that's
 
05:49:57.750 --> 05:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
comforting i hope you'll take comfort in
 
05:50:00.070 --> 05:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
is that the science demonstrates and
 
05:50:01.510 --> 05:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
i've sent some articles and i'll be glad
 
05:50:03.510 --> 05:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
to share some additional ones that even
 
05:50:06.230 --> 05:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
at 100 times the consumption that a
 
05:50:08.390 --> 05:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
human might consume of kratom in a day
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
there is no there's no respiratory
 
05:50:12.310 --> 05:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
suppression and no deaths but that
 
05:50:14.470 --> 05:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that that it cannot become
 
05:50:16.470 --> 05:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
you can't develop a dependency on it if
 
05:50:19.110 --> 05:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
you overuse it or abuse it and so we
 
05:50:20.948 --> 05:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
think that children ought to have the
 
05:50:23.430 --> 05:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
regulation of a parent uh advising them
 
05:50:25.510 --> 05:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
as best they can and so the in the way
 
05:50:27.830 --> 05:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
that we regulate tobacco products and
 
05:50:30.230 --> 05:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
alcohol different age limits that's sort
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
of the thinking behind it but we
 
05:50:34.070 --> 05:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
recognize the reality is that the
 
05:50:36.628 --> 05:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
children can use kratom uh and might but
 
05:50:38.390 --> 05:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
they're we want them to think through
 
05:50:40.310 --> 05:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
this decision and not abuse it and
 
05:50:41.750 --> 05:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's our thinking behind it we
 
05:50:43.350 --> 05:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
jettison it if you felt like that were
 
05:50:46.628 --> 05:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh our key concern here is
 
05:50:48.868 --> 05:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
eliminating adulterated kratom products
 
05:50:50.788 --> 05:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
from the marketplace and that only
 
05:50:52.948 --> 05:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
happens if the states will unify and
 
05:50:55.110 --> 05:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
send the message clearly that they are
 
05:50:56.548 --> 05:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
not going to tolerate adulterated
 
05:50:57.830 --> 05:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
craving products to be sold in their
 
05:50:57.840 --> 05:50:59.270 align:start position:0%
craving products to be sold in their
states

05:50:59.270 --> 05:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:51:00.788 --> 05:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
okay representative herbert has a
 
05:51:00.798 --> 05:51:01.770 align:start position:0%
okay representative herbert has a
question

05:51:01.770 --> 05:51:01.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:51:01.780 --> 05:51:06.708 align:start position:0%
question
[Music]

05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:08.390 --> 05:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
yes i like
 
05:51:11.030 --> 05:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt thank you
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt and and thank you for the
 
05:51:16.070 --> 05:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
information uh mr hat uh i i didn't know
 
05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
what kratom was until uh
 
05:51:18.958 --> 05:51:20.070 align:start position:0%
what kratom was until uh
today

05:51:20.070 --> 05:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:51:23.350 --> 05:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
but uh it where i have it i'm having
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
difficulty and i don't to try and figure
 
05:51:28.230 --> 05:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
it out today
 
05:51:30.548 --> 05:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
is that it sounds to me as though you
 
05:51:32.310 --> 05:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
have a product
 
05:51:32.320 --> 05:51:33.110 align:start position:0%
have a product
that

05:51:33.110 --> 05:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:51:34.788 --> 05:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:51:36.788 --> 05:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
should be
 
05:51:39.590 --> 05:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
regulated and allowed to be sold
 
05:51:42.310 --> 05:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
as a prescription of some sort and then
 
05:51:43.270 --> 05:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:51:46.150 --> 05:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
because i you know all the nice things
 
05:51:47.830 --> 05:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking about in terms of
 
05:51:49.990 --> 05:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
relieving anxiety helping
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
mitigate pain etc etc
 
05:51:56.470 --> 05:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like uh you're
 
05:51:59.270 --> 05:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's almost like a homeopathic slash
 
05:52:02.070 --> 05:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
bufferin slash aspirin
 
05:52:02.080 --> 05:52:02.948 align:start position:0%
bufferin slash aspirin
uh

05:52:02.948 --> 05:52:02.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:52:05.990 --> 05:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
fouls tasting something or other
 
05:52:08.230 --> 05:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
i i think you have to you have to i
 
05:52:10.708 --> 05:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
would i would would you believe i would
 
05:52:13.590 --> 05:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
rather you convince the colleen smiths
 
05:52:14.708 --> 05:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
of the world
 
05:52:18.230 --> 05:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh to get you an entry pathway
 
05:52:20.548 --> 05:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
uh that you can live with
 
05:52:24.390 --> 05:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
but asking 20 uh state reps
 
05:52:28.390 --> 05:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
here in concord uh is to me uh
 
05:52:31.430 --> 05:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
an interesting exercise but uh very very
 
05:52:32.788 --> 05:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
hard for me to
 
05:52:32.798 --> 05:52:34.948 align:start position:0%
hard for me to
to

05:52:34.948 --> 05:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:52:37.510 --> 05:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh give you yes
 
05:52:39.030 --> 05:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
i guess this is a belief
 
05:52:40.948 --> 05:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
would you believe would you believe i
 
05:52:42.548 --> 05:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
think you i think you have to convince
 
05:52:43.990 --> 05:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
some other people
 
05:52:45.830 --> 05:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
first all he has to do is convince this
 
05:52:48.868 --> 05:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:50.230 --> 05:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know you don't have to answer a
 
05:52:53.030 --> 05:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
would you believe questions
 
05:52:54.708 --> 05:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for the the issue that you've
 
05:52:56.868 --> 05:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
raised here and i understand that you
 
05:52:59.350 --> 05:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
may see a characterization here of it
 
05:53:02.470 --> 05:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
being used in a prescription drug format
 
05:53:04.868 --> 05:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
and i think that there is and the nastu
 
05:53:06.470 --> 05:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
institute on drug abuse agrees with you
 
05:53:08.310 --> 05:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
that there may be a potential
 
05:53:10.070 --> 05:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
synthesized version of kratom which
 
05:53:12.788 --> 05:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
would have a standard dosage strength
 
05:53:14.070 --> 05:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
that would go through the new drug
 
05:53:16.708 --> 05:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
application process which can be and the
 
05:53:19.510 --> 05:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
director of nida has said it it can be
 
05:53:21.830 --> 05:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
an option for and a replacement for
 
05:53:23.830 --> 05:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
dangerously addictive and potentially
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
deadly opioids we think that potentially
 
05:53:28.310 --> 05:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
is the future but that is in a
 
05:53:30.708 --> 05:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical grade product there are
 
05:53:33.750 --> 05:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
many many products foods and and foods
 
05:53:35.670 --> 05:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
is a categorization driven by the food
 
05:53:37.670 --> 05:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
drug and cosmetic act but there are many
 
05:53:39.990 --> 05:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
products on the market today that have
 
05:53:43.750 --> 05:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
benefits that are not as concentrated as
 
05:53:45.750 --> 05:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
a prescription drug has but yet are
 
05:53:47.350 --> 05:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
available and people can use it to help
 
05:53:50.070 --> 05:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
manage uh lower symptoms that they might
 
05:53:52.070 --> 05:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
have on some of these anxiety issues and
 
05:53:53.670 --> 05:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
pain issues and that's what kratom
 
05:53:55.590 --> 05:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
offers and most of the of the
 
05:53:57.190 --> 05:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs that we have today
 
05:53:59.830 --> 05:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
have their origins in plants and this is
 
05:54:01.590 --> 05:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
an example of a plant that's been used
 
05:54:05.030 --> 05:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
safely for centuries and it needs to be
 
05:54:07.830 --> 05:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
available in a safe form in its natural
 
05:54:10.230 --> 05:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
plant form to consumers and we want to
 
05:54:12.628 --> 05:54:12.638 align:start position:0%
eliminate from the marketplace these bad
 
05:54:14.470 --> 05:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
actors so we hope you'll consider that
 
05:54:16.548 --> 05:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
and understand there's a pathway in the
 
05:54:18.548 --> 05:54:18.558 align:start position:0%
future for this becoming depending on
 
05:54:21.270 --> 05:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
intended use by a manufacturer a dietary
 
05:54:23.190 --> 05:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
supplement under the
 
05:54:25.270 --> 05:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
dietary supplement notification process
 
05:54:28.868 --> 05:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
or a new drug application
 
05:54:29.830 --> 05:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:54:31.830 --> 05:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay let's
 
05:54:33.430 --> 05:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
represent immaculate
 
05:54:35.510 --> 05:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you mr chair
 
05:54:36.628 --> 05:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
how just
 
05:54:41.030 --> 05:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
mr haydow how actually would you
 
05:54:43.510 --> 05:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that you had this purified
 
05:54:45.990 --> 05:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
version coming into the state is there
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
05:54:47.280 --> 05:54:48.390 align:start position:0%
is there a
a

05:54:48.390 --> 05:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:54:50.628 --> 05:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
you know some sort of a lab test that
 
05:54:53.110 --> 05:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
you could do on it is there an existing
 
05:54:55.350 --> 05:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh company that would do that and put
 
05:54:57.590 --> 05:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
like a like with cigarettes a stamp on
 
05:54:59.990 --> 05:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
it or something like that
 
05:55:01.990 --> 05:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
so so the kratom raw material that's
 
05:55:03.590 --> 05:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
used in the manufacturing of kratom
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
products here in the united states
 
05:55:07.670 --> 05:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
originates in indonesia there's about
 
05:55:09.590 --> 05:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
five percent that comes from thailand
 
05:55:10.948 --> 05:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
and malaysia
 
05:55:13.990 --> 05:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
it is tested by the manufacturers for
 
05:55:16.788 --> 05:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
contaminants the adult duration occurs
 
05:55:18.310 --> 05:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
here in the united states by
 
05:55:20.868 --> 05:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous vendors so when a product
 
05:55:22.868 --> 05:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
is sold in its pure firm form it has
 
05:55:25.030 --> 05:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
gone through testing in order to make
 
05:55:26.628 --> 05:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
sure it's free from those contaminants
 
05:55:29.030 --> 05:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
that might be dangerous to consumers uh
 
05:55:31.830 --> 05:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
the the idea that someone might want to
 
05:55:34.310 --> 05:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
adulterate the product in order to give
 
05:55:36.310 --> 05:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
it an effect that it does not naturally
 
05:55:38.788 --> 05:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
have in order to then economically
 
05:55:41.350 --> 05:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
benefit from increased sales is the area
 
05:55:42.628 --> 05:55:42.638 align:start position:0%
that we're really concerned about in
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
protecting consumers because i as i
 
05:55:46.708 --> 05:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier many consumers buy
 
05:55:48.548 --> 05:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
what they think is a pure product that
 
05:55:50.628 --> 05:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
has been certified with a what they call
 
05:55:52.150 --> 05:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
a certificate of analysis from an
 
05:55:54.548 --> 05:55:54.558 align:start position:0%
independent uh lab testing firm to make
 
05:55:56.230 --> 05:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
sure it's free of those contaminants
 
05:55:58.310 --> 05:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
they think they're buying pure kratom
 
05:55:59.270 --> 05:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
and what they're getting is an
 
05:56:01.110 --> 05:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
adulterated product and that's why we
 
05:56:03.030 --> 05:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
think this is important for consumers to
 
05:56:05.030 --> 05:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
be protected because right now there's
 
05:56:10.310 --> 05:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:11.590 --> 05:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
05:56:13.590 --> 05:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions for mr
 
05:56:13.600 --> 05:56:15.110 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions for mr
hatto

mr chan with your permission i'll send
 
05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%

05:56:25.830 --> 05:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
the of the committee members
 
05:56:27.430 --> 05:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
some of the questions i'll be glad to do
 
05:56:29.830 --> 05:56:29.840 align:start position:0%

05:56:34.390 --> 05:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
05:56:38.708 --> 05:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
um i see another hand up uh oh kate fry

okay so uh kate did you sign up i didn't
 
05:56:45.590 --> 05:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:45.600 --> 05:56:52.390 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:56:52.390 --> 05:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:55.590 --> 05:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:57.430 --> 05:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't expect you to weigh in on this
 
05:56:59.910 --> 05:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
one but i wasn't planning to weigh in on
 
05:56:59.920 --> 05:57:00.628 align:start position:0%
one but i wasn't planning to weigh in on
a

05:57:00.628 --> 05:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:57:02.788 --> 05:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt so i had not signed up and
 
05:57:06.390 --> 05:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
i apologize no problem me okay yep we
 
05:57:09.110 --> 05:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
can it's saying i'm muted um i we
 
05:57:11.270 --> 05:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
actually uh new future is not taking a
 
05:57:12.948 --> 05:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
position on this bill we've been
 
05:57:15.110 --> 05:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
watching it and monitoring it from from
 
05:57:17.990 --> 05:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
afar and attending some hearings
 
05:57:20.708 --> 05:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
but i guess i had the same question that
 
05:57:22.948 --> 05:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
you did regarding the age and the
 
05:57:22.958 --> 05:57:24.310 align:start position:0%
you did regarding the age and the
regulation

05:57:24.310 --> 05:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
05:57:26.230 --> 05:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to say this because this
 
05:57:28.788 --> 05:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
committee has done a lot of great work
 
05:57:32.070 --> 05:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
on issues like tobacco control and we
 
05:57:35.270 --> 05:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
did increase that age to 21. and you
 
05:57:38.708 --> 05:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
have to be 21 to drink we also know a
 
05:57:41.510 --> 05:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
lot of the issues around addiction and
 
05:57:45.510 --> 05:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
that sensitive age period of 18 to 21 so
 
05:57:47.590 --> 05:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
i'm really curious why
 
05:57:50.868 --> 05:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
the um sponsor the bell chose 18 i did a
 
05:57:52.708 --> 05:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
quick search again i'm not familiar with
 
05:57:56.070 --> 05:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
this issue very much um a state i
 
05:57:57.510 --> 05:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
looks like tennessee
 
05:58:00.070 --> 05:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
has it at 21 so
 
05:58:02.310 --> 05:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
um if you go down that road i would
 
05:58:04.310 --> 05:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
seriously consider why you would be
 
05:58:07.350 --> 05:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
selecting an age of 18 when we know
 
05:58:10.470 --> 05:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
18 to 21 is critical with
 
05:58:12.230 --> 05:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
brain development there's a lot we don't
 
05:58:15.110 --> 05:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
know about kratom and i would just uh
 
05:58:16.548 --> 05:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
caution you to be
 
05:58:16.558 --> 05:58:17.990 align:start position:0%
caution you to be
cautious

05:58:17.990 --> 05:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
cautious
 
05:58:19.350 --> 05:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
and that's all i want to say and i
 
05:58:21.190 --> 05:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
apologize again for not signing up all
 
05:58:23.110 --> 05:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
right so i guess that was my fault for
 
05:58:25.750 --> 05:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
mentioning the 21
 
05:58:27.670 --> 05:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much kate
 
05:58:30.150 --> 05:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
all right uh seeing no more hands up on
 
05:58:33.190 --> 05:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
my in the attendees list
 
05:58:33.200 --> 05:58:34.628 align:start position:0%
my in the attendees list
and

05:58:34.628 --> 05:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:58:38.310 --> 05:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
so i will end the public hearing
 
05:58:42.470 --> 05:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
on house bill 333 uh we had 25 people in
 
05:58:45.670 --> 05:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
support we had four people opposed and
 
05:58:48.868 --> 05:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
nobody and nobody's neutral on it and
 
05:58:50.390 --> 05:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
with that we will close the public
 
05:58:53.270 --> 05:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and we are behind schedule now
 
05:58:55.190 --> 05:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
officially okay
 
05:58:57.430 --> 05:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
so the last but not least is house bill
 
05:58:57.440 --> 05:58:59.350 align:start position:0%
so the last but not least is house bill
335

05:58:59.350 --> 05:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
335
 
05:59:01.910 --> 05:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
so i'll ask the sponsor i see your chuck
 
05:59:02.948 --> 05:59:02.958 align:start position:0%

house

05:59:27.750 --> 05:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:59:30.390 --> 05:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
five uh which is a bill relative to the
 
05:59:32.628 --> 05:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
labeling of bottled water
 
05:59:34.868 --> 05:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh this bill originally came in under a
 
05:59:37.590 --> 05:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
different name uh two sessions ago
 
05:59:40.708 --> 05:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
i introduced it uh as a with mindy
 
05:59:42.390 --> 05:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative mindy messier
 
05:59:43.510 --> 05:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
and it was a bill to require the
 
05:59:45.110 --> 05:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
labeling of bottled water here in new
 
05:59:45.120 --> 05:59:46.310 align:start position:0%
labeling of bottled water here in new
hampshire

05:59:46.310 --> 05:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:59:48.470 --> 05:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
the last two years
 
05:59:48.480 --> 05:59:50.470 align:start position:0%
the last two years
um

05:59:50.470 --> 05:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:53.190 --> 05:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
consumer reports has done studies on the
 
05:59:55.110 --> 05:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
quality of our drinking water and
 
05:59:58.150 --> 05:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
particularly bottled water in 2019
 
06:00:00.390 --> 06:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
november 2019 they
 
06:00:00.400 --> 06:00:01.190 align:start position:0%
november 2019 they
um

06:00:01.190 --> 06:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:03.750 --> 06:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
they did a very comprehensive report on
 
06:00:05.910 --> 06:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
the quality of our bottled water
 
06:00:09.350 --> 06:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
with the advent of pfas
 
06:00:12.150 --> 06:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
and a number of other contaminants that
 
06:00:13.430 --> 06:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we've been very
 
06:00:15.270 --> 06:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
aggressively addressing
 
06:00:16.868 --> 06:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
06:00:19.590 --> 06:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
people have looked at bottled water as a
 
06:00:20.788 --> 06:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
safe haven
 
06:00:23.350 --> 06:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
let's say when they have concerns
 
06:00:25.510 --> 06:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
of the quality of their drinking water
 
06:00:27.030 --> 06:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh we have adopted some very good
 
06:00:29.190 --> 06:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
standards but still we have a long way
 
06:00:30.150 --> 06:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
to go
 
06:00:32.868 --> 06:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that uh when we
 
06:00:34.548 --> 06:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
originally introduced this bill we felt
 
06:00:36.150 --> 06:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
that it was something that people needed
 
06:00:38.628 --> 06:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
to know what was in their bottled water
 
06:00:41.030 --> 06:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
last session it was house bill 1274
 
06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
which was before your committee
 
06:00:45.990 --> 06:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
and you took it under advisement and you
 
06:00:48.230 --> 06:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
decided to amend it to
 
06:00:49.990 --> 06:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
take care of the legalities as far as
 
06:00:51.830 --> 06:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
federal regulations were concerned as
 
06:00:53.110 --> 06:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
far as new hampshire that it would be
 
06:00:54.310 --> 06:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
just for
 
06:00:56.548 --> 06:00:56.558 align:start position:0%
basically that any bottled water in the
 
06:00:58.628 --> 06:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
state sold in the state of new hampshire
 
06:01:00.230 --> 06:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
would have to meet state of new
 
06:01:01.670 --> 06:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire drinking water quality
 
06:01:01.680 --> 06:01:02.788 align:start position:0%
hampshire drinking water quality
standards

06:01:02.788 --> 06:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
standards
 
06:01:03.990 --> 06:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
06:01:05.990 --> 06:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's the least we can do for those
 
06:01:09.190 --> 06:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
parents who depend on bottled water as a
 
06:01:11.350 --> 06:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
safe source of drinking water i mean the
 
06:01:13.110 --> 06:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
best we could do is to label it so they
 
06:01:14.788 --> 06:01:14.798 align:start position:0%
would know what was in their water but
 
06:01:17.190 --> 06:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
we may not be able to actively do that
 
06:01:19.350 --> 06:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
but what we can do is we can require
 
06:01:21.670 --> 06:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
that the minimum drinking water
 
06:01:24.230 --> 06:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
meets the drinking water minimum to meet
 
06:01:25.670 --> 06:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
state standards
 
06:01:27.110 --> 06:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
your committee took on an advisement
 
06:01:28.628 --> 06:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
amended the bill
 
06:01:30.708 --> 06:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
totally happy with that as far as it's
 
06:01:32.310 --> 06:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
something that we can get into
 
06:01:34.470 --> 06:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
application it passed the house last
 
06:01:35.590 --> 06:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
year was approved by this committee
 
06:01:37.510 --> 06:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
passed the house and it sort of died on
 
06:01:40.310 --> 06:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
the covert floor in the senate last year
 
06:01:42.310 --> 06:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh which was unfortunate but it's
 
06:01:44.230 --> 06:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
something that we hopefully we can
 
06:01:45.990 --> 06:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
correct this year getting this bill
 
06:01:48.150 --> 06:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
through i know the department of health
 
06:01:50.470 --> 06:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
and human services has also suggested
 
06:01:52.948 --> 06:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
another amendment i would support i have
 
06:01:56.628 --> 06:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
a chance to quickly review that and
 
06:01:58.470 --> 06:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
i certainly would support it anything
 
06:02:00.150 --> 06:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
that they can do
 
06:02:02.628 --> 06:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
that they feel they need to make this
 
06:02:04.230 --> 06:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
bill more enforceable
 
06:02:05.910 --> 06:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
is certainly welcome
 
06:02:07.190 --> 06:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's a start
 
06:02:08.628 --> 06:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
and it's a start in the right direction
 
06:02:10.310 --> 06:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
and it may be satisfactory for most
 
06:02:11.670 --> 06:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
people to know that at least the bottled
 
06:02:13.350 --> 06:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
water that they're buying the stores
 
06:02:15.190 --> 06:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
meets requirements my understanding is
 
06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
and talking with lobbyists that those
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturers within the state of new
 
06:02:20.628 --> 06:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire have no problem with this bill
 
06:02:22.868 --> 06:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
some out-of-state manufacturers do when
 
06:02:24.470 --> 06:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
you take a look at the amount of efas
 
06:02:26.948 --> 06:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
and some water that comes into the state
 
06:02:30.070 --> 06:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
it's signific it is significant
 
06:02:31.990 --> 06:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
and this is water which we have no
 
06:02:33.990 --> 06:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
control over so maybe we want to take a
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
look at if they want to sell in the
 
06:02:36.548 --> 06:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire they'll have to
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
meet state standards i'll try to anthony
 
06:02:41.830 --> 06:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
questions you have mr chairman
 
06:02:44.788 --> 06:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think so i did do you have
 
06:02:47.030 --> 06:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
any evidence that we've had any bottled
 
06:02:48.948 --> 06:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
water in this state that actually did
 
06:02:51.750 --> 06:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
have pfas or any or anything that did
 
06:02:53.830 --> 06:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
not meet our water standards is there
 
06:02:55.670 --> 06:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
any evidence that that we've ever had
 
06:02:57.350 --> 06:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
bottled water problem
 
06:02:59.590 --> 06:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
i will i will tell you that according to
 
06:03:02.868 --> 06:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
the uh consumer reports articles they
 
06:03:04.788 --> 06:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
list a number of bottled waters that
 
06:03:07.270 --> 06:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
have pc pfast levels of above certain
 
06:03:09.670 --> 06:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
levels and below certain levels and they
 
06:03:11.350 --> 06:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
list the names of those companies i will
 
06:03:13.270 --> 06:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
be happy to send those companies that
 
06:03:15.750 --> 06:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
list to the committee
 
06:03:17.350 --> 06:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
okay and i assume these are bottled
 
06:03:18.548 --> 06:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
waters that are available in new
 
06:03:20.470 --> 06:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire some of them are available in
 
06:03:21.510 --> 06:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire some of them are not
 
06:03:23.670 --> 06:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
available here they actually in one
 
06:03:25.430 --> 06:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
category they list here they actually
 
06:03:28.470 --> 06:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
have a poland spring water that is as a
 
06:03:31.110 --> 06:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
relatively high level of bottled water
 
06:03:33.590 --> 06:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
um of pfast in the water so it's
 
06:03:35.350 --> 06:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
something that we'd want to take a look
 
06:03:37.110 --> 06:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
at now that may have been cleaned up and
 
06:03:39.030 --> 06:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully companies do clean up their
 
06:03:42.708 --> 06:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
water but we don't know that's the thing
 
06:03:46.070 --> 06:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
right so this bill requires you to send
 
06:03:49.750 --> 06:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh tests on how regular basis right if
 
06:03:50.948 --> 06:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with the water how
 
06:03:53.030 --> 06:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
regularly supposed to be sending sampler
 
06:03:53.040 --> 06:03:53.910 align:start position:0%
regularly supposed to be sending sampler
tests

06:03:53.910 --> 06:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
tests
 
06:03:55.910 --> 06:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
to the to the department
 
06:03:58.150 --> 06:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
it it there is a they've said the
 
06:03:59.590 --> 06:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
06:04:01.590 --> 06:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
will be centered rules and regulations
 
06:04:03.750 --> 06:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with that uh that they will make
 
06:04:05.350 --> 06:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
that determination on how many times
 
06:04:07.430 --> 06:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
they shall have to comply with with
 
06:04:10.070 --> 06:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
testing okay so you're saying this is
 
06:04:11.510 --> 06:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
consumer report weren't the ones
 
06:04:13.030 --> 06:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
consumer report one point time saying
 
06:04:14.708 --> 06:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
new york city water was the best water
 
06:04:17.590 --> 06:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
to drink actually yeah they were and i
 
06:04:19.750 --> 06:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
mean that was a that's an old study but
 
06:04:21.910 --> 06:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of clean water i mean a
 
06:04:23.590 --> 06:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
lot of bottled water manufacturers here
 
06:04:24.628 --> 06:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire get the
 
06:04:26.390 --> 06:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
water from londonderry right from the
 
06:04:26.400 --> 06:04:27.270 align:start position:0%
water from londonderry right from the
tap

06:04:27.270 --> 06:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
tap
 
06:04:29.430 --> 06:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
and they add a few chemicals to a few
 
06:04:31.430 --> 06:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
minerals to it to enhance the flavor but
 
06:04:32.548 --> 06:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
it comes right out of the tap of
 
06:04:34.788 --> 06:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
londonderry and that's good to know as
 
06:04:37.350 --> 06:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
long as londonderry
 
06:04:42.628 --> 06:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:44.070 --> 06:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
which i assume they have to submit the
 
06:04:45.670 --> 06:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
water to be tested yes
 
06:04:48.150 --> 06:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
okay anyway okay representative abramson
 
06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:52.788 --> 06:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was trying to lower my hand

thank you chairman
 
06:05:08.240 --> 06:05:10.628 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
um

06:05:13.670 --> 06:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
so am i to understand uh mr grassi that
 
06:05:13.680 --> 06:05:14.788 align:start position:0%
so am i to understand uh mr grassi that
uh

06:05:14.788 --> 06:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:05:14.798 --> 06:05:15.590 align:start position:0%
uh
the

06:05:15.590 --> 06:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:05:17.110 --> 06:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed
 
06:05:18.628 --> 06:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
last year
 
06:05:18.638 --> 06:05:19.590 align:start position:0%
last year
uh

06:05:19.590 --> 06:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:05:21.670 --> 06:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment that you
 
06:05:23.510 --> 06:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
you're fine with that bill
 
06:05:25.110 --> 06:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
but there's an amendment that the
 
06:05:27.510 --> 06:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
department would like to see in it and
 
06:05:29.350 --> 06:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
so we're very close to having a bill
 
06:05:29.360 --> 06:05:30.070 align:start position:0%
so we're very close to having a bill
that

06:05:30.070 --> 06:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:05:34.470 --> 06:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh will pass and and satisfy your
 
06:05:36.708 --> 06:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh your desires to have cleaner water or
 
06:05:38.868 --> 06:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
better water or whatever
 
06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
is that where we are thank you for the
 
06:05:42.548 --> 06:05:42.558 align:start position:0%
question yes the bill that that i
 
06:05:44.628 --> 06:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
introduced this year was the bill that
 
06:05:46.548 --> 06:05:46.558 align:start position:0%
came out of this committee last year you
 
06:05:48.628 --> 06:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
folks took the original ballot bill you
 
06:05:51.350 --> 06:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
amended it based on recommendations from
 
06:05:54.788 --> 06:05:54.798 align:start position:0%
dhhs and others and you amended it and
 
06:05:56.310 --> 06:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
the bill passed out of this committee to
 
06:05:58.470 --> 06:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
the floor and was passed by the house
 
06:06:01.190 --> 06:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
um dhhs has said they would like some
 
06:06:03.350 --> 06:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
additional amendments i just found out
 
06:06:06.230 --> 06:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
about that this weekend and i i
 
06:06:07.990 --> 06:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
briefly scan them i have no problems
 
06:06:10.150 --> 06:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
with it basically it helps them as far
 
06:06:13.510 --> 06:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
as setting up their rule making process
 
06:06:17.030 --> 06:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:19.350 --> 06:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
let me
 
06:06:20.948 --> 06:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:06:23.190 --> 06:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative grassy
 
06:06:25.830 --> 06:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh londonderry water
 
06:06:27.990 --> 06:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
that comes through the pipe comes from
 
06:06:30.150 --> 06:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
the dairy water system
 
06:06:32.310 --> 06:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
which comes from the manchester water
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
works which is one of the ten top
 
06:06:36.390 --> 06:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
aquifer systems
 
06:06:39.830 --> 06:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the united states would you believe
 
06:06:41.750 --> 06:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
i i would believe that and i will tell
 
06:06:43.350 --> 06:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
you one thing because we had here in
 
06:06:46.230 --> 06:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
rochester i'm from we also have a uh we
 
06:06:48.390 --> 06:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
have our water which is which is
 
06:06:51.590 --> 06:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
basically from reservoirs instead of
 
06:06:54.230 --> 06:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
aquifers reservoirs tend to have fewer
 
06:06:57.270 --> 06:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
problems with bfast than aquifers do but
 
06:06:59.510 --> 06:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
i understand that the system over there
 
06:06:59.520 --> 06:07:00.230 align:start position:0%
i understand that the system over there
is

06:07:00.230 --> 06:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:07:03.030 --> 06:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
is quite complex how the water circles
 
06:07:04.708 --> 06:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
around and eventually comes out of your
 
06:07:07.110 --> 06:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
tap it does come from manchester from
 
06:07:09.510 --> 06:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
the major uh reservoirs and afterwards
 
06:07:11.830 --> 06:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
that they do have
 
06:07:14.150 --> 06:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you very much uh
 
06:07:16.070 --> 06:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
06:07:18.868 --> 06:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
you were are you a co-sponsor or you're
 
06:07:23.030 --> 06:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:24.868 --> 06:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you very much mr chairman
 
06:07:26.628 --> 06:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
my name is representative david muse i'm
 
06:07:28.470 --> 06:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
from portsmouth and i'm just here to
 
06:07:30.628 --> 06:07:30.638 align:start position:0%
lend my full support to this bill
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
um portsmouth
 
06:07:34.628 --> 06:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
uh like many new hampshire communities
 
06:07:37.510 --> 06:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
has found itself on the wrong side of
 
06:07:39.190 --> 06:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
water contamination several times
 
06:07:40.868 --> 06:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
throughout its history one of the things
 
06:07:42.708 --> 06:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit unique about my
 
06:07:44.390 --> 06:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
community is that we find found
 
06:07:47.110 --> 06:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves on both sides of the issue
 
06:07:48.390 --> 06:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
we have been
 
06:07:51.030 --> 06:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
both the victim of the negligence of
 
06:07:53.990 --> 06:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
another party uh over at uh peace trade
 
06:07:54.000 --> 06:07:55.270 align:start position:0%
another party uh over at uh peace trade
port

06:07:55.270 --> 06:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
port
 
06:07:57.670 --> 06:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
and we've also been a responsible party
 
06:07:57.680 --> 06:07:58.708 align:start position:0%
and we've also been a responsible party
um

06:07:58.708 --> 06:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:01.510 --> 06:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
in coakley landfill uh responsible for
 
06:08:04.788 --> 06:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
uh the contamination of of of water uh
 
06:08:06.390 --> 06:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
this affected water supplies in
 
06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
greenland northampton and rye
 
06:08:09.990 --> 06:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh so one of the things that we're
 
06:08:11.990 --> 06:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
pretty familiar with are bottled water
 
06:08:12.000 --> 06:08:12.788 align:start position:0%
pretty familiar with are bottled water
and

06:08:12.788 --> 06:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the things that i've
 
06:08:15.590 --> 06:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
seen over the years
 
06:08:17.670 --> 06:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
is just the the anxiety and the
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
consternation on the part of people who
 
06:08:20.948 --> 06:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden find out that their
 
06:08:24.150 --> 06:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
water supply um is contaminated
 
06:08:24.160 --> 06:08:25.030 align:start position:0%
water supply um is contaminated
and

06:08:25.030 --> 06:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:26.708 --> 06:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
and i think the one thing that that
 
06:08:28.548 --> 06:08:28.558 align:start position:0%
pretty much all of them accept as the
 
06:08:29.910 --> 06:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
gold standard
 
06:08:31.830 --> 06:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
is that the water that's provided to
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
them the bottled water that's provided
 
06:08:36.310 --> 06:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
to them and while their their own water
 
06:08:37.990 --> 06:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
supply is offline
 
06:08:40.868 --> 06:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
uh is actually cleaner than the water
 
06:08:43.270 --> 06:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
that would be coming out of their tap
 
06:08:43.280 --> 06:08:44.070 align:start position:0%
that would be coming out of their tap
and

06:08:44.070 --> 06:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:46.070 --> 06:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that happened uh just
 
06:08:47.750 --> 06:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago there was an
 
06:08:50.070 --> 06:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
incident where a company called spring
 
06:08:51.350 --> 06:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
hill farms out of haverhill
 
06:08:54.868 --> 06:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
massachusetts was bottling water uh for
 
06:08:57.910 --> 06:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
companies like uh uh store brand water
 
06:09:00.390 --> 06:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
for companies like whole foods cbs
 
06:09:03.190 --> 06:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
market basket uh and cumberland farms
 
06:09:04.948 --> 06:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
and the peat fast levels in those in
 
06:09:07.190 --> 06:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
that water actually exceeded the former
 
06:09:09.910 --> 06:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
federal standards so 70 parts per
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
trillion we're not talking about the
 
06:09:13.190 --> 06:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
state standards that were recent
 
06:09:15.030 --> 06:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
reasonably passed this water didn't even
 
06:09:17.350 --> 06:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
pass muster under the under the federal
 
06:09:20.310 --> 06:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
standards so this is something that has
 
06:09:22.310 --> 06:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
happened in new hampshire and one of the
 
06:09:24.070 --> 06:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
things that representative uh grassley
 
06:09:26.150 --> 06:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
recommend uh actually said during his
 
06:09:28.948 --> 06:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
testimony is that consumer reports has
 
06:09:32.788 --> 06:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
actually gone out and uh requested uh
 
06:09:36.310 --> 06:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
water uh water reports uh from over 200
 
06:09:38.708 --> 06:09:38.718 align:start position:0%
companies that sell bottled water uh and
 
06:09:41.110 --> 06:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
they also did their own spa testing and
 
06:09:43.110 --> 06:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
as a result of some of that uh spot
 
06:09:45.510 --> 06:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
testing uh there actually were several
 
06:09:48.390 --> 06:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
brands that had to uh or they chose to
 
06:09:50.788 --> 06:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
remove their brands from the market
 
06:09:53.110 --> 06:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
because they had levels of chemicals in
 
06:09:55.590 --> 06:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
them not just pfas but chemicals like
 
06:09:59.190 --> 06:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
antimony uh and arsenic um that were
 
06:10:02.150 --> 06:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
also above the standards so this this is
 
06:10:04.628 --> 06:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
not sort of a shot in the dark situation
 
06:10:07.110 --> 06:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
that that happens every once in a while
 
06:10:07.120 --> 06:10:08.150 align:start position:0%
that that happens every once in a while
um

06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:10.948 --> 06:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
this is something that that has happened
 
06:10:13.670 --> 06:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
um that will probably happen again
 
06:10:15.430 --> 06:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the things i think that i
 
06:10:17.270 --> 06:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
remember from last year's testimony is
 
06:10:19.510 --> 06:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
there were folks from the uh
 
06:10:21.830 --> 06:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
international bottled water association
 
06:10:23.830 --> 06:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
that came in and talked about
 
06:10:25.830 --> 06:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
the rigorous standards that they have
 
06:10:28.390 --> 06:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
and and essentially how the the industry
 
06:10:31.110 --> 06:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
likes to police themselves
 
06:10:32.708 --> 06:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that we found in the
 
06:10:35.270 --> 06:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
case of the the spring hill valley
 
06:10:37.110 --> 06:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
contamination is that
 
06:10:38.628 --> 06:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
they were not members of the
 
06:10:41.190 --> 06:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
international bottled water association
 
06:10:44.070 --> 06:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
and not every company is so
 
06:10:44.080 --> 06:10:45.270 align:start position:0%
and not every company is so
essentially

06:10:45.270 --> 06:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
06:10:47.830 --> 06:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
i'm here to say
 
06:10:49.750 --> 06:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the statute that's in front
 
06:10:52.470 --> 06:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
of you now uh it looks much simpler and
 
06:10:54.150 --> 06:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
much more straightforward than the one
 
06:10:55.990 --> 06:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
that we had in front of you one of you
 
06:11:00.070 --> 06:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
last year it really requires um that
 
06:11:00.080 --> 06:11:00.830 align:start position:0%
last year it really requires um that
that

06:11:00.830 --> 06:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:11:02.948 --> 06:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
06:11:04.788 --> 06:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
06:11:08.548 --> 06:11:08.558 align:start position:0%
that you know we we review the um
 
06:11:10.628 --> 06:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh that that essentially bottled water
 
06:11:13.110 --> 06:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
companies comply uh with the same
 
06:11:15.510 --> 06:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
standards uh as our our public drinking
 
06:11:18.548 --> 06:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
water standards uh and you know to me it
 
06:11:21.110 --> 06:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
just makes common sense uh that we would
 
06:11:23.510 --> 06:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
do that and that we would require that
 
06:11:25.830 --> 06:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
um and i'll
 
06:11:30.948 --> 06:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:32.708 --> 06:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
okay i guess we're
 
06:11:34.070 --> 06:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
we're all set
 
06:11:35.750 --> 06:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
past three three o'clock hour people are
 
06:11:37.270 --> 06:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
slowing down
 
06:11:40.070 --> 06:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you uh so
 
06:11:40.080 --> 06:11:41.190 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you uh so
uh

06:11:41.190 --> 06:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:11:43.270 --> 06:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
you know it calmly smells like i can't
 
06:11:44.868 --> 06:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
believe i moved you off and then i'd
 
06:11:46.470 --> 06:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
take to turn the page and see you're
 
06:11:49.270 --> 06:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
still there so um i'm glad i was able to
 
06:11:50.708 --> 06:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
schedule these two bills right next to
 
06:11:52.230 --> 06:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
each other so that you could testify to
 
06:11:53.590 --> 06:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
both of them
 
06:11:55.190 --> 06:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
so i realized the department is neutral
 
06:11:57.430 --> 06:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
but you did say you want to share some
 
06:11:57.440 --> 06:11:58.868 align:start position:0%
but you did say you want to share some
stuff

06:11:58.868 --> 06:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
06:12:00.390 --> 06:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman hunt and members of
 
06:12:01.910 --> 06:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
the committee again for the record my
 
06:12:03.110 --> 06:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
name is colleen smith i'm the
 
06:12:04.628 --> 06:12:04.638 align:start position:0%
administrator of the food protection
 
06:12:06.470 --> 06:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
section within the department of health
 
06:12:09.030 --> 06:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
and human services and i'm here today to
 
06:12:10.548 --> 06:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
provide some background information
 
06:12:12.310 --> 06:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
regarding the current regulation of
 
06:12:13.670 --> 06:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
bottled water in new hampshire and
 
06:12:15.430 --> 06:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
available to answer any questions that
 
06:12:18.708 --> 06:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
you have pertaining to these regulations
 
06:12:20.708 --> 06:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
so the food protection section within
 
06:12:23.750 --> 06:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
dhhs we currently license and inspect
 
06:12:25.990 --> 06:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
all in-state manufacturers of bottled
 
06:12:28.470 --> 06:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
water and we register annually all
 
06:12:30.628 --> 06:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
out-of-state manufacturers of bottled
 
06:12:32.390 --> 06:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
water who distribute bottled water in
 
06:12:34.470 --> 06:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:12:36.788 --> 06:12:36.798 align:start position:0%
we would like to let you know that we
 
06:12:38.948 --> 06:12:38.958 align:start position:0%
are initiating rule making
 
06:12:41.270 --> 06:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
that would also
 
06:12:43.830 --> 06:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
require bottled water to meet the same
 
06:12:46.310 --> 06:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
standards as drinking water standards in
 
06:12:47.510 --> 06:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:12:50.948 --> 06:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
particularly the the requirements for
 
06:12:53.030 --> 06:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
the four pfos
 
06:12:56.070 --> 06:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
substances and also arsenic so we are
 
06:12:58.390 --> 06:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
hoping to complete this rule making by
 
06:13:00.788 --> 06:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
this summer um and we have started to
 
06:13:02.708 --> 06:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
alert our stakeholders of of this
 
06:13:05.510 --> 06:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
upcoming rule change
 
06:13:07.190 --> 06:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
we are very happy to hear that
 
06:13:10.070 --> 06:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative grassy is amenable to a
 
06:13:11.830 --> 06:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
suggested language change and it's a
 
06:13:13.590 --> 06:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
very small change
 
06:13:15.270 --> 06:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
to this current
 
06:13:17.830 --> 06:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
bill which would just clarify that we
 
06:13:19.750 --> 06:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
are intending this
 
06:13:21.990 --> 06:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
this to apply to only water that's for
 
06:13:24.868 --> 06:13:24.878 align:start position:0%
retail sale in new hampshire and not for
 
06:13:28.150 --> 06:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
retail sale in other states so that
 
06:13:30.390 --> 06:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
suggested language is in my written
 
06:13:33.270 --> 06:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
testimony which was distributed to the
 
06:13:35.030 --> 06:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee in advance
 
06:13:36.868 --> 06:13:36.878 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd be happy to take any
 
06:13:38.548 --> 06:13:38.558 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:13:40.310 --> 06:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
regarding bottled water regulations
 
06:13:42.390 --> 06:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
right so you already have statutory
 
06:13:43.510 --> 06:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
authority to go ahead with this
 
06:13:43.520 --> 06:13:45.750 align:start position:0%
authority to go ahead with this
rulemaking

06:13:45.750 --> 06:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
06:13:47.670 --> 06:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
so currently the the bottled water
 
06:13:49.430 --> 06:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
standards are in our administrative
 
06:13:51.830 --> 06:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
rules and they refer to
 
06:13:53.590 --> 06:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
the standard that's standards that are
 
06:13:55.830 --> 06:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the code of federal regulations and
 
06:13:57.510 --> 06:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
within rulemaking we would just be
 
06:13:59.270 --> 06:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
looking to add
 
06:13:59.280 --> 06:14:00.230 align:start position:0%
looking to add
those

06:14:00.230 --> 06:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:14:01.990 --> 06:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
that are
 
06:14:03.990 --> 06:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
different which are the four pfos
 
06:14:06.628 --> 06:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
contaminate contaminants or substances
 
06:14:09.510 --> 06:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
and the arsenic those are the only
 
06:14:09.520 --> 06:14:10.868 align:start position:0%
and the arsenic those are the only
differences

06:14:10.868 --> 06:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
differences
 
06:14:13.670 --> 06:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the drinking water standards and the
 
06:14:17.110 --> 06:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:19.590 --> 06:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm confused so i i'm saying do
 
06:14:21.350 --> 06:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
you have you know
 
06:14:23.430 --> 06:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
again do we why do we need this bill if
 
06:14:24.868 --> 06:14:24.878 align:start position:0%
you're going ahead with the rulemaking
 
06:14:28.230 --> 06:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
and implementing it already
 
06:14:28.240 --> 06:14:29.110 align:start position:0%
and implementing it already
so

06:14:29.110 --> 06:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:14:30.628 --> 06:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
um that that's
 
06:14:33.510 --> 06:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
a great question it like i guess uh
 
06:14:35.430 --> 06:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
there would probably there's there we
 
06:14:36.708 --> 06:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
have to go through the rule making
 
06:14:39.510 --> 06:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
process there could be stakeholder um
 
06:14:42.150 --> 06:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
there could be stakeholder
 
06:14:43.750 --> 06:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
that come out in the public hearing that
 
06:14:46.788 --> 06:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
perv that prevent this but this would be
 
06:14:49.030 --> 06:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
two i guess two ways to get at the the
 
06:14:52.548 --> 06:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
same end result if if it was so um
 
06:14:54.310 --> 06:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
deemed that it should be in statute as
 
06:14:57.030 --> 06:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
well okay and when do you plan to do the
 
06:14:58.788 --> 06:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
the hearings the rule hearings and when
 
06:15:00.230 --> 06:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
the rules so
 
06:15:02.708 --> 06:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
we have just started the process those
 
06:15:04.390 --> 06:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
public hearings would be scheduled
 
06:15:07.990 --> 06:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
within the next few months
 
06:15:10.390 --> 06:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
so if we were to retain this bill till
 
06:15:12.310 --> 06:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
next september we'll know whether there
 
06:15:15.510 --> 06:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
was any pushback or any problems
 
06:15:17.670 --> 06:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes that would be correct
 
06:15:17.680 --> 06:15:18.708 align:start position:0%
yes that would be correct
okay

06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:15:21.830 --> 06:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative abramson has a question
 
06:15:23.350 --> 06:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
06:15:26.830 --> 06:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:29.910 --> 06:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
um how is this enforced do you just
 
06:15:32.548 --> 06:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
randomly sample uh bottles
 
06:15:34.948 --> 06:15:34.958 align:start position:0%
and uh what happens if someone fails you
 
06:15:37.190 --> 06:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
know one of the tests is there an appeal
 
06:15:38.788 --> 06:15:38.798 align:start position:0%
or a certain period of time before they
 
06:15:41.270 --> 06:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
have to do another test
 
06:15:44.070 --> 06:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
so our intention within
 
06:15:46.708 --> 06:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
within our rule would be to ask that
 
06:15:49.270 --> 06:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
bottled water manufacturers submit
 
06:15:51.510 --> 06:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
proof of having their water anal
 
06:15:54.628 --> 06:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
analyzed for these components with their
 
06:15:57.350 --> 06:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
registry annual registration
 
06:16:00.310 --> 06:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
from an accredited lab
 
06:16:01.990 --> 06:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay so all all
 
06:16:05.670 --> 06:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
their entire supply of water um
 
06:16:08.070 --> 06:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
oh yeah further question um so my second
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
question was
 
06:16:11.990 --> 06:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you would make the
 
06:16:13.430 --> 06:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
habits make the small change that it
 
06:16:15.670 --> 06:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to water that is exported
 
06:16:17.430 --> 06:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
or sold to other states wouldn't it
 
06:16:21.270 --> 06:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:23.110 --> 06:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
the purpose or a purpose of this bill
 
06:16:25.430 --> 06:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
would be that the water that we sell if
 
06:16:28.230 --> 06:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's made in new hampshire at least
 
06:16:29.910 --> 06:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
any new hampshire bottled water meets
 
06:16:31.990 --> 06:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
our standards kind of try to increase
 
06:16:33.670 --> 06:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
the value of water that's sold in new
 
06:16:36.310 --> 06:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire or maybe
 
06:16:38.868 --> 06:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
no no um just to clarify so in-state
 
06:16:41.430 --> 06:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturers would have to comply with
 
06:16:43.990 --> 06:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
the same standards as drinking water
 
06:16:46.470 --> 06:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's just that the way this the bill is
 
06:16:49.030 --> 06:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
worded there could be confusion to say
 
06:16:51.830 --> 06:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
that our rules would apply to these
 
06:16:53.830 --> 06:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
autostate bottled water manufacturers
 
06:16:55.510 --> 06:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
regardless if they're selling in new
 
06:16:57.910 --> 06:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire or other states so we we just
 
06:17:00.150 --> 06:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
want a clarifying language that this
 
06:17:03.510 --> 06:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
requirement is only for their products
 
06:17:04.830 --> 06:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
sold in new
 
06:17:07.350 --> 06:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire a quick follow-up
 
06:17:10.150 --> 06:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
further question you may inquire
 
06:17:12.230 --> 06:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that your
 
06:17:14.390 --> 06:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
preference is that this would apply only
 
06:17:16.788 --> 06:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
to water that's sold in new hampshire or
 
06:17:17.990 --> 06:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
water that's
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
made that's
 
06:17:21.350 --> 06:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
made in new hampshire and then sentences
 
06:17:22.628 --> 06:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that she doesn't want to
 
06:17:25.030 --> 06:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
regulate water that is made in maine and
 
06:17:26.868 --> 06:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
shipped to new york
 
06:17:29.430 --> 06:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
she only cares about if it is sold in
 
06:17:38.708 --> 06:17:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:41.430 --> 06:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair um thanks ms
 
06:17:44.548 --> 06:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
smith you've been here a long day today
 
06:17:44.558 --> 06:17:45.830 align:start position:0%
smith you've been here a long day today
um

06:17:45.830 --> 06:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:49.830 --> 06:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
my question is how long has dhhs been
 
06:17:53.190 --> 06:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
looking at this issue regarding
 
06:17:56.310 --> 06:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:57.910 --> 06:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
require the
 
06:18:00.390 --> 06:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
in-state bottlers
 
06:18:03.510 --> 06:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
comply with the regulations
 
06:18:06.310 --> 06:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
so our timing on this was aligning with
 
06:18:08.868 --> 06:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
the the change into the drinking water
 
06:18:12.470 --> 06:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
standards so so um you know just within
 
06:18:14.868 --> 06:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
the recent years and for those those
 
06:18:18.230 --> 06:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
standards to become um official in
 
06:18:20.470 --> 06:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
regulation from the drinking water
 
06:18:23.430 --> 06:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint so once that uh once that was
 
06:18:25.110 --> 06:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
finalized then we started to move
 
06:18:27.750 --> 06:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
forward with looking at bottled water to
 
06:18:30.628 --> 06:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
comply with the same standards
 
06:18:32.708 --> 06:18:32.718 align:start position:0%
for the question manquer thanks very
 
06:18:34.230 --> 06:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
much um
 
06:18:35.670 --> 06:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
so can you give me some kind of a
 
06:18:38.070 --> 06:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
timeline because i think we had the pfas
 
06:18:40.628 --> 06:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
um discussion a couple of years ago and
 
06:18:44.868 --> 06:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
you were looking at it at that time too
 
06:18:47.190 --> 06:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
so one of the one of the things that we
 
06:18:50.150 --> 06:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
had to wait for was for these to become
 
06:18:53.190 --> 06:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
um official regulations for drinking
 
06:18:56.310 --> 06:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
water and there were some there was some
 
06:19:00.948 --> 06:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:03.270 --> 06:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
so does that mean this is good
 
06:19:03.280 --> 06:19:04.150 align:start position:0%
so does that mean this is good
sorry

06:19:04.150 --> 06:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:19:06.708 --> 06:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
so does that mean
 
06:19:08.628 --> 06:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
the process is now
 
06:19:11.430 --> 06:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
clear and it can move right forward and
 
06:19:13.830 --> 06:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
we don't need the bell or should we i'm
 
06:19:15.030 --> 06:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
not going to ask you whether we should
 
06:19:16.868 --> 06:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
move forward with the bill but i'm i'm a
 
06:19:19.510 --> 06:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
little concerned about the timeline
 
06:19:21.590 --> 06:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so sorry so there so there were
 
06:19:24.230 --> 06:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
some regulatory challenges with the rule
 
06:19:26.230 --> 06:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
in the department of environmental
 
06:19:29.590 --> 06:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
services uh there there was um there had
 
06:19:32.230 --> 06:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
to be an actual those started in rule if
 
06:19:33.910 --> 06:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
if you recall those standards for
 
06:19:35.590 --> 06:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
drinking water and then they were put
 
06:19:39.110 --> 06:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
into statute last in la the last session
 
06:19:40.708 --> 06:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
and so we had to wait for that process
 
06:19:43.270 --> 06:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
to be complete before we look to update
 
06:19:46.070 --> 06:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
the bottled water standards so we're
 
06:19:48.788 --> 06:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
hopeful now that those are in place in
 
06:19:51.750 --> 06:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
statute and in rural for drinking water
 
06:19:53.910 --> 06:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
there's there's not a reason for us not
 
06:19:55.510 --> 06:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to move forward with our
 
06:19:55.520 --> 06:19:57.270 align:start position:0%
to be able to move forward with our
rulemaking

06:19:57.270 --> 06:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
06:20:00.230 --> 06:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:02.470 --> 06:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
06:20:05.030 --> 06:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
06:20:07.110 --> 06:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
taking for taking my question ms smith i
 
06:20:09.670 --> 06:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
know it's been a very long day
 
06:20:12.470 --> 06:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
my question is on
 
06:20:16.628 --> 06:20:16.638 align:start position:0%
21 cfr 165 110 b
 
06:20:17.990 --> 06:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
are the
 
06:20:22.230 --> 06:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
mcls the five mcls embedded in that or
 
06:20:24.628 --> 06:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
is that in addition to
 
06:20:25.830 --> 06:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
so those five
 
06:20:29.110 --> 06:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
mcls are not in the cfr that's why we
 
06:20:31.350 --> 06:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
would want to add them
 
06:20:33.910 --> 06:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
either in statute or rule
 
06:20:37.110 --> 06:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:20:39.830 --> 06:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much uh miss

until you're on jim
 
06:20:59.590 --> 06:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
you just have to unmute yourself there
 
06:21:00.390 --> 06:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
you go
 
06:21:02.548 --> 06:21:02.558 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon i'm james toner
 
06:21:03.910 --> 06:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
director of government relations for the
 
06:21:05.830 --> 06:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
international bottled water association
 
06:21:07.270 --> 06:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
i think you've heard us mention a few
 
06:21:08.788 --> 06:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
times here and we thank you for the
 
06:21:11.590 --> 06:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on house bill 35
 
06:21:11.600 --> 06:21:12.788 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on house bill 35
335

06:21:12.788 --> 06:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
335
 
06:21:14.230 --> 06:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
although we consider ourselves neutral
 
06:21:16.708 --> 06:21:16.718 align:start position:0%
on the bill uh ibwa still has concerns
 
06:21:18.548 --> 06:21:18.558 align:start position:0%
over the precedent which set
 
06:21:20.948 --> 06:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
imposing new hampshire safe uh drinking
 
06:21:23.030 --> 06:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
water accuracily regulations on a
 
06:21:25.110 --> 06:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
product manufactured outside of the
 
06:21:26.948 --> 06:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
state interferes with interstate
 
06:21:28.708 --> 06:21:28.718 align:start position:0%
commerce and we put out of state
 
06:21:30.470 --> 06:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
bottlers at a disadvantage when trying
 
06:21:33.350 --> 06:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
to sell a product in the state
 
06:21:35.830 --> 06:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
the epa sets drinking water standards
 
06:21:37.190 --> 06:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
for the nation and allows states to
 
06:21:39.590 --> 06:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
impose standards that may differ or be
 
06:21:41.430 --> 06:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
stricter than what has been set
 
06:21:43.270 --> 06:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
nationally that is due to the fact that
 
06:21:45.350 --> 06:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
the state water oversight only applies
 
06:21:47.590 --> 06:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
to water within a state does not apply
 
06:21:49.430 --> 06:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
to drinking water in any other state or
 
06:21:49.440 --> 06:21:50.628 align:start position:0%
to drinking water in any other state or
country

06:21:50.628 --> 06:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
country
 
06:21:52.948 --> 06:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
the fda set standards for bottled water
 
06:21:55.030 --> 06:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
and while they follow the epa in regard
 
06:21:57.350 --> 06:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
to their standards they do not follow
 
06:21:59.190 --> 06:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
the individual states they do not allow
 
06:22:01.190 --> 06:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
for individual states to impose
 
06:22:03.190 --> 06:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
standards that are greater than that was
 
06:22:05.910 --> 06:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
imposed by the fda
 
06:22:07.350 --> 06:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
states have attempted to do this and
 
06:22:09.590 --> 06:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
have been notified by the fda that they
 
06:22:11.270 --> 06:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
have exceeded their jurisdiction and
 
06:22:12.708 --> 06:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
that the national standard for bottled
 
06:22:15.910 --> 06:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
water is set by the fda
 
06:22:17.430 --> 06:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
i state that we are neutral on this bill
 
06:22:19.830 --> 06:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
because ibw members are already required
 
06:22:21.510 --> 06:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
to meet standards set by our code of
 
06:22:23.830 --> 06:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
practice ibwa's code of practice with
 
06:22:25.510 --> 06:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
regard to the standards
 
06:22:27.590 --> 06:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh to several contaminants is stricter
 
06:22:29.990 --> 06:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
than fda and we are allowed to do this
 
06:22:31.590 --> 06:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
as a bottler does not have to be a
 
06:22:34.230 --> 06:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
member of ibwa but if they wish to they
 
06:22:35.750 --> 06:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
must comply with the association
 
06:22:37.990 --> 06:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
standards this includes testing for
 
06:22:39.510 --> 06:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
contaminants that are not currently
 
06:22:42.310 --> 06:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
addressed by either epa or fda such as
 
06:22:42.320 --> 06:22:43.430 align:start position:0%
addressed by either epa or fda such as
pfas

06:22:43.430 --> 06:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
06:22:45.590 --> 06:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
or mtbe
 
06:22:47.670 --> 06:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
we believe that ibwa's code of practice
 
06:22:49.270 --> 06:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
covers all the requirements set within
 
06:22:51.270 --> 06:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire sales safe drinking
 
06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
water act but nine ibw members
 
06:22:56.548 --> 06:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
may likely not be testing for everything
 
06:22:58.708 --> 06:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
covered by the act and solely operate
 
06:23:00.948 --> 06:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
based upon fda requirements but they
 
06:23:02.310 --> 06:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
know they are completely within the
 
06:23:04.310 --> 06:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
national standards based upon the fda
 
06:23:04.320 --> 06:23:05.590 align:start position:0%
national standards based upon the fda
guidelines

06:23:05.590 --> 06:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
06:23:07.030 --> 06:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
is our suggestion that the committee
 
06:23:08.310 --> 06:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
report the bill and expediate to
 
06:23:10.310 --> 06:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
legislate in an effort to avoid possible
 
06:23:12.548 --> 06:23:12.558 align:start position:0%
conflict with fda on bottled water
 
06:23:16.150 --> 06:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
oversight and jurisdiction thank you
 
06:23:18.868 --> 06:23:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you we do have a question
 
06:23:19.910 --> 06:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
of course
 
06:23:21.830 --> 06:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thanks very much
 
06:23:23.510 --> 06:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
06:23:24.948 --> 06:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
06:23:26.470 --> 06:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
i have a tough time with your saying
 
06:23:29.430 --> 06:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
that you are neutral on this because it
 
06:23:32.230 --> 06:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
um from your testimony it sounds like
 
06:23:34.788 --> 06:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
you don't want more regulation um on the
 
06:23:34.798 --> 06:23:36.070 align:start position:0%
you don't want more regulation um on the
standards

06:23:36.070 --> 06:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
standards
 
06:23:39.750 --> 06:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
um and that if as a yes or no question
 
06:23:41.830 --> 06:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
it does not sound that like you are
 
06:23:43.510 --> 06:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
06:23:44.948 --> 06:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not supporting it but i'm not
 
06:23:46.548 --> 06:23:46.558 align:start position:0%
opposed to it because our members are
 
06:23:49.430 --> 06:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
already complying with the regulations
 
06:23:51.430 --> 06:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
you have set in the state but what
 
06:23:53.990 --> 06:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
you're doing is is against what fda
 
06:23:56.150 --> 06:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
requirements are and i'm it's more of a
 
06:23:58.628 --> 06:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
kind of a caveat that if you go down
 
06:24:00.708 --> 06:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
this path you will get notified by the
 
06:24:02.948 --> 06:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
fda that you don't have a jurisdiction
 
06:24:06.230 --> 06:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
as a state to do this
 
06:24:07.430 --> 06:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
the question is do we not have the
 
06:24:10.070 --> 06:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to regulate what's going to
 
06:24:12.070 --> 06:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
other states or do we not have
 
06:24:13.670 --> 06:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions you don't have the
 
06:24:15.750 --> 06:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to regulate
 
06:24:17.590 --> 06:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
a bottled water that's being
 
06:24:19.350 --> 06:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
bottled at a neighboring state coming
 
06:24:21.590 --> 06:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
into your state you cannot require that
 
06:24:23.030 --> 06:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
bottled water
 
06:24:24.948 --> 06:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
to meet the standards that new hampshire
 
06:24:28.230 --> 06:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:28.240 --> 06:24:29.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:24:29.110 --> 06:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:24:30.470 --> 06:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
and this is a
 
06:24:31.910 --> 06:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
federal preempt this is federal
 
06:24:31.920 --> 06:24:33.190 align:start position:0%
federal preempt this is federal
guidelines

06:24:33.190 --> 06:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
06:24:35.350 --> 06:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
are preemption that that we we state
 
06:24:35.360 --> 06:24:36.548 align:start position:0%
are preemption that that we we state
cannot

06:24:36.548 --> 06:24:36.558 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
06:24:36.558 --> 06:24:37.430 align:start position:0%
cannot
uh

06:24:37.430 --> 06:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:24:39.270 --> 06:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's the standards that are over
 
06:24:40.868 --> 06:24:40.878 align:start position:0%
you know i think you look at it kind of
 
06:24:43.190 --> 06:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
this way you know that that the
 
06:24:45.270 --> 06:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
it is it is interstate commerce is the
 
06:24:48.470 --> 06:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
issue here uh in that even though uh
 
06:24:50.470 --> 06:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
a bottler who is not in your state
 
06:24:53.110 --> 06:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
follows all the fda guidelines uh that
 
06:24:55.510 --> 06:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
they are acquired to uh but then they're
 
06:24:57.110 --> 06:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
not allowed to sell in your state
 
06:24:58.310 --> 06:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
because they have to meet the
 
06:25:00.070 --> 06:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
requirements you have in your state that
 
06:25:04.470 --> 06:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:07.990 --> 06:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
well that's it'll be interesting
 
06:25:09.990 --> 06:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative abramson you have a
 
06:25:10.000 --> 06:25:12.470 align:start position:0%
okay representative abramson you have a
question

06:25:12.470 --> 06:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:14.310 --> 06:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
06:25:17.750 --> 06:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
toner for taking my question um
 
06:25:19.830 --> 06:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh where would we find the uh federal
 
06:25:21.590 --> 06:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines is that listed on the fda's
 
06:25:23.910 --> 06:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
website or is that a federal yes yeah
 
06:25:25.990 --> 06:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
you can find the guidelines both both
 
06:25:28.390 --> 06:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
epas and fda's guidelines in terms of
 
06:25:29.750 --> 06:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
what they require for testing
 
06:25:32.070 --> 06:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
contaminants on both their websites
 
06:25:34.628 --> 06:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
as well actually you could go to ibwa's
 
06:25:36.868 --> 06:25:36.878 align:start position:0%
website and look at our code of practice
 
06:25:41.350 --> 06:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
that we compare uh ebas fdas and ours uh
 
06:25:43.510 --> 06:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's a full list of them
 
06:25:45.830 --> 06:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much cool
 
06:25:47.990 --> 06:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
everybody all set
 
06:25:50.230 --> 06:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh as often happens we have another hand
 
06:25:51.830 --> 06:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
that pops up and uh former
 
06:25:53.750 --> 06:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative messmer
 
06:25:56.070 --> 06:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
mindy feels like uh feels like you i've
 
06:25:58.708 --> 06:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
sponsored this bill originally like six
 
06:26:00.230 --> 06:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
years ago or something
 
06:26:02.230 --> 06:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
06:26:03.830 --> 06:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
what's up welcome back to the congress
 
06:26:03.840 --> 06:26:04.868 align:start position:0%
what's up welcome back to the congress
committee

06:26:04.868 --> 06:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:26:06.548 --> 06:26:06.558 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh thank you for
 
06:26:08.070 --> 06:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony and thank you for
 
06:26:10.948 --> 06:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
hearing this important bill as you just
 
06:26:12.390 --> 06:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
stated i did
 
06:26:14.708 --> 06:26:14.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor with representative grassy the
 
06:26:14.718 --> 06:26:15.910 align:start position:0%
sponsor with representative grassy the
first

06:26:15.910 --> 06:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
first
 
06:26:18.390 --> 06:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
iteration of this bill a few years ago
 
06:26:20.948 --> 06:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
and interestingly enough after that
 
06:26:22.788 --> 06:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
first bill was sponsored went through
 
06:26:24.390 --> 06:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
06:26:26.470 --> 06:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire as mentioned
 
06:26:28.150 --> 06:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
by representative muse
 
06:26:31.190 --> 06:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
des did go out and sample about 30
 
06:26:32.868 --> 06:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
bottled water companies in the state of
 
06:26:34.948 --> 06:26:34.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:26:37.750 --> 06:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
randomly they just picked 30. and five
 
06:26:40.150 --> 06:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
of those samples came back with pfas
 
06:26:43.350 --> 06:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
levels above our current mcls right now
 
06:26:46.548 --> 06:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
and some were even above as represented
 
06:26:50.390 --> 06:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
the epa number so clearly the the
 
06:26:52.310 --> 06:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
compliance of bottled water companies
 
06:26:52.320 --> 06:26:53.190 align:start position:0%
compliance of bottled water companies
with

06:26:53.190 --> 06:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:26:56.310 --> 06:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
epa standards was not being adhered to
 
06:26:57.830 --> 06:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
and certainly that was discovered in the
 
06:26:59.350 --> 06:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire that company
 
06:27:00.708 --> 06:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
immediately i believe went out of
 
06:27:03.110 --> 06:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
business is no longer selling bottled
 
06:27:05.510 --> 06:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
water in new hampshire but
 
06:27:05.520 --> 06:27:06.310 align:start position:0%
water in new hampshire but
the

06:27:06.310 --> 06:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:27:08.468 --> 06:27:08.478 align:start position:0%
i ask you to support this bill even
 
06:27:10.548 --> 06:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
though rulemaking may be going on
 
06:27:13.670 --> 06:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's still no official notice of the
 
06:27:15.910 --> 06:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
food service people and the
 
06:27:18.868 --> 06:27:18.878 align:start position:0%
rulemaking but because this is the
 
06:27:18.878 --> 06:27:19.990 align:start position:0%
rulemaking but because this is the
language

06:27:19.990 --> 06:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
06:27:21.910 --> 06:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
says that bottled water in new hampshire
 
06:27:23.510 --> 06:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
should adhere to
 
06:27:25.670 --> 06:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
our drinking water mcls and so that
 
06:27:27.670 --> 06:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
covers more than just
 
06:27:30.548 --> 06:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
the pfas that it appears the rulemaking
 
06:27:32.868 --> 06:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
may cover along with the arsenic that
 
06:27:34.628 --> 06:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking may cover
 
06:27:34.638 --> 06:27:35.430 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking may cover
it

06:27:35.430 --> 06:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:27:38.628 --> 06:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
is more flexible in that as new drinking
 
06:27:41.430 --> 06:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
water levels are passed and promulgated
 
06:27:43.110 --> 06:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire that the
 
06:27:44.548 --> 06:27:44.558 align:start position:0%
bottled water companies would have to
 
06:27:46.708 --> 06:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
keep up with those including
 
06:27:49.030 --> 06:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
mtve which was
 
06:27:53.110 --> 06:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
one of the i think it was 2015 where new
 
06:27:55.430 --> 06:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire passed a pretty
 
06:27:58.628 --> 06:27:58.638 align:start position:0%
strict enforcement of mtbe
 
06:27:59.830 --> 06:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
on drinking water in the state of new
 
06:28:01.590 --> 06:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire and so it would also cover
 
06:28:03.430 --> 06:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
things like mtbe which it doesn't sound
 
06:28:04.868 --> 06:28:04.878 align:start position:0%
like the drinking water the bottled
 
06:28:07.590 --> 06:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
water rule making that the food service
 
06:28:09.670 --> 06:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
people are doing right now would cover
 
06:28:12.230 --> 06:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
um so i guess the crux of this is is you
 
06:28:14.390 --> 06:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
know we have decided in new hampshire
 
06:28:16.548 --> 06:28:16.558 align:start position:0%
what is safe for people to drink in new
 
06:28:18.708 --> 06:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire and as representative grassy
 
06:28:21.430 --> 06:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
said when people like all of the people
 
06:28:23.750 --> 06:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the merrimack bedford litchfield area
 
06:28:25.910 --> 06:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
people live in portsmouth when they feel
 
06:28:28.070 --> 06:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
that and know that their drinking water
 
06:28:30.070 --> 06:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
provided to them is unsafe and they're
 
06:28:31.590 --> 06:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
provided bottled water by the state of
 
06:28:33.430 --> 06:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and want to go to the
 
06:28:35.510 --> 06:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
store and buy bottled water to protect
 
06:28:37.510 --> 06:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
their families to be in compliance while
 
06:28:39.510 --> 06:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
we're sorting through
 
06:28:41.750 --> 06:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
liability issues with the industrial
 
06:28:44.788 --> 06:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
polluters they should be able to
 
06:28:47.590 --> 06:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
know and understand and rely upon the
 
06:28:49.270 --> 06:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
safety of the bottled water that
 
06:28:50.628 --> 06:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
actually the bottled water they're
 
06:28:53.030 --> 06:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
getting is as safe as the state of new
 
06:28:55.830 --> 06:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire says is safe
 
06:28:57.830 --> 06:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
for instance you could buy bottled water
 
06:29:00.310 --> 06:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
right now bottled in massachusetts and
 
06:29:02.868 --> 06:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
it may have levels of arsenic and mtbe
 
06:29:02.878 --> 06:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
it may have levels of arsenic and mtbe
higher

06:29:03.830 --> 06:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
higher
 
06:29:06.468 --> 06:29:06.478 align:start position:0%
than the tap water in our state is
 
06:29:08.468 --> 06:29:08.478 align:start position:0%
allowed to serve you by your water
 
06:29:10.548 --> 06:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
supplier so i think this is a very
 
06:29:11.910 --> 06:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
important bill
 
06:29:13.670 --> 06:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
i would say you know it's been a very
 
06:29:15.990 --> 06:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
long time there still is no public
 
06:29:18.390 --> 06:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
notice around the rule making these
 
06:29:20.468 --> 06:29:20.478 align:start position:0%
could go into effect by june of this
 
06:29:21.990 --> 06:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
year if the governor
 
06:29:25.430 --> 06:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
signed this into law and that would put
 
06:29:27.030 --> 06:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
you know the drinking water the bottle
 
06:29:29.110 --> 06:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
drinking water of all these people who
 
06:29:31.110 --> 06:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
are stressed and worried about their
 
06:29:34.070 --> 06:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
public water supplies uh feeling that
 
06:29:35.750 --> 06:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
they are water that the bottled water is
 
06:29:37.190 --> 06:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
safe for them and their families to
 
06:29:40.310 --> 06:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
consume so i ask you to please pass this
 
06:29:46.788 --> 06:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:49.190 --> 06:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
i said but it is true that the bill asks
 
06:29:51.430 --> 06:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
for rulemaking anyways
 
06:29:51.440 --> 06:29:52.390 align:start position:0%
for rulemaking anyways
so

06:29:52.390 --> 06:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:29:54.150 --> 06:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't want them to wait
 
06:29:56.150 --> 06:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
around with the making we want to go
 
06:29:58.948 --> 06:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
steam full steam ahead and and not wait
 
06:30:00.948 --> 06:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
for us to pass the legislation and that
 
06:30:03.030 --> 06:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
they'd have an effective date you know
 
06:30:05.430 --> 06:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
who knows effective date 60 days after
 
06:30:08.390 --> 06:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
passage that when they when we better to
 
06:30:10.868 --> 06:30:10.878 align:start position:0%
wait to see what happens in that ruling
 
06:30:13.590 --> 06:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
process and see what what hurdles were
 
06:30:15.750 --> 06:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
created that we might want to address
 
06:30:18.390 --> 06:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
can i respond to that yes like i said
 
06:30:21.590 --> 06:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
this is more broad in in terms of you
 
06:30:24.150 --> 06:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
know not just the pfas and the mt and
 
06:30:26.390 --> 06:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
the arsenic levels that they're going to
 
06:30:28.788 --> 06:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
maybe set but this covers
 
06:30:30.468 --> 06:30:30.478 align:start position:0%
you know making sure that the bottled
 
06:30:32.310 --> 06:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
water and drinking water regulations
 
06:30:35.350 --> 06:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
line up in the state of new hampshire
 
06:30:37.510 --> 06:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
06:30:40.468 --> 06:30:40.478 align:start position:0%
uh representative has a question for you
 
06:30:42.310 --> 06:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
oh i was just taking my hand down that
 
06:30:45.430 --> 06:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:45.440 --> 06:30:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:30:46.310 --> 06:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:30:48.868 --> 06:30:48.878 align:start position:0%
i have uh no more oh i do have another
 
06:30:51.430 --> 06:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
hand up so thank you very much mindy
 
06:30:55.750 --> 06:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh so i have cynthia walter i am the
 
06:30:58.468 --> 06:30:58.478 align:start position:0%
promote to pants so for you guys you do
 
06:31:01.110 --> 06:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
know how to do the new sign up process
 
06:31:02.948 --> 06:31:02.958 align:start position:0%
go ahead you know choke it would be if
 
06:31:05.030 --> 06:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
you had signed up ahead of time then it
 
06:31:08.310 --> 06:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
would be handy handier so but
 
06:31:14.628 --> 06:31:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:20.070 --> 06:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:22.150 --> 06:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
there you go okay i got the unmuted uh
 
06:31:23.750 --> 06:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
sorry i was trying it couldn't get the
 
06:31:26.230 --> 06:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
button to work so yes i'm cynthia walter
 
06:31:28.230 --> 06:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
i have a phd i've been teaching
 
06:31:30.548 --> 06:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
toxicology and my specialty is water
 
06:31:30.558 --> 06:31:31.750 align:start position:0%
toxicology and my specialty is water
pollution

06:31:31.750 --> 06:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
pollution
 
06:31:35.030 --> 06:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
um i hardly endorse this bill again
 
06:31:36.868 --> 06:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
because it covers
 
06:31:39.270 --> 06:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
not only the current rulemating rule
 
06:31:42.150 --> 06:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
making plans regarding a few important
 
06:31:44.468 --> 06:31:44.478 align:start position:0%
pollutants but it also addresses things
 
06:31:48.390 --> 06:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the future it signals water suppliers
 
06:31:50.230 --> 06:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
that either draw their water from new
 
06:31:52.070 --> 06:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire and or draw their water from
 
06:31:53.990 --> 06:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
other parts of the country
 
06:31:55.510 --> 06:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
to um
 
06:31:57.590 --> 06:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
that what we require for our bottled
 
06:31:59.510 --> 06:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
water in our state
 
06:32:01.670 --> 06:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
we need to do this first and foremost
 
06:32:03.910 --> 06:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
just because of the same old adage
 
06:32:06.788 --> 06:32:06.798 align:start position:0%
safety first
 
06:32:10.548 --> 06:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
and this tells your decisions today um
 
06:32:13.110 --> 06:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
going forward with this bill tell the
 
06:32:16.070 --> 06:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
citizens and also then these companies
 
06:32:17.750 --> 06:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
where we stand in new hampshire on
 
06:32:19.670 --> 06:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
safety first
 
06:32:22.070 --> 06:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
the other feature that i'd like to add
 
06:32:24.548 --> 06:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
they encourage you to do is to expand
 
06:32:27.030 --> 06:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
beyond bottled water because it
 
06:32:30.070 --> 06:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
specifies in here products but it
 
06:32:31.990 --> 06:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't distinguish
 
06:32:34.070 --> 06:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't open up the door to saying
 
06:32:35.350 --> 06:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
that other
 
06:32:35.360 --> 06:32:36.310 align:start position:0%
that other
um

06:32:36.310 --> 06:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:36.320 --> 06:32:37.190 align:start position:0%
um
water

06:32:37.190 --> 06:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
water
 
06:32:39.990 --> 06:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
based products um you know drinks of
 
06:32:43.910 --> 06:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
various mixtures um need also to provide
 
06:32:47.030 --> 06:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
some of those safety uh features
 
06:32:50.548 --> 06:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure just how you came to the
 
06:32:50.558 --> 06:32:51.590 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure just how you came to the
words

06:32:51.590 --> 06:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
words
 
06:32:54.390 --> 06:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
bottled water and how you define that
 
06:32:54.400 --> 06:32:55.110 align:start position:0%
bottled water and how you define that
but

06:32:55.110 --> 06:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:32:57.510 --> 06:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see it expanded
 
06:32:59.750 --> 06:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
to other drink products
 
06:33:02.548 --> 06:33:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:05.270 --> 06:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know well so so you're if you're
 
06:33:07.350 --> 06:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
besides so i think the other brothers
 
06:33:10.830 --> 06:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:12.868 --> 06:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh would say the coca-cola and pepsi
 
06:33:15.190 --> 06:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
they have they uh the uh osmosis or
 
06:33:16.868 --> 06:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
something something
 
06:33:18.948 --> 06:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
the osmosis though or what is it what is
 
06:33:21.110 --> 06:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
that term um they use the word first
 
06:33:23.270 --> 06:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
osmosis excuse me reverse osmosis is
 
06:33:25.190 --> 06:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
what you're thinking of yeah so are you
 
06:33:27.190 --> 06:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
saying that water is not needs to be
 
06:33:29.110 --> 06:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
tested too
 
06:33:31.590 --> 06:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
well what i'm saying is is that because
 
06:33:32.868 --> 06:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
06:33:35.110 --> 06:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
say that the other products that
 
06:33:35.120 --> 06:33:36.468 align:start position:0%
say that the other products that
originate

06:33:36.468 --> 06:33:36.478 align:start position:0%
originate
 
06:33:38.788 --> 06:33:38.798 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and as there are
 
06:33:41.590 --> 06:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
compiled and manufactured and sold
 
06:33:43.910 --> 06:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
either within new hampshire
 
06:33:45.590 --> 06:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know as as are sold within new
 
06:33:45.600 --> 06:33:46.628 align:start position:0%
you know as as are sold within new
hampshire

06:33:46.628 --> 06:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:33:49.830 --> 06:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
that when the final finished product has
 
06:33:51.030 --> 06:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
06:33:52.548 --> 06:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
those standards
 
06:33:54.628 --> 06:33:54.638 align:start position:0%
so we understand that the bottle water
 
06:33:56.628 --> 06:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
needs to meet those five products
 
06:33:58.628 --> 06:33:58.638 align:start position:0%
because water bottled water is probably
 
06:34:01.190 --> 06:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
defined as the finished product
 
06:34:03.830 --> 06:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
but when we have to simply expand to the
 
06:34:07.030 --> 06:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
finished product of an orange drink or
 
06:34:09.030 --> 06:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
you know some other drink
 
06:34:11.110 --> 06:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
does that make sense but i'm not saying
 
06:34:12.788 --> 06:34:12.798 align:start position:0%
that this bill needs to be rewritten in
 
06:34:15.430 --> 06:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
that broader sense i'm just saying let's
 
06:34:16.948 --> 06:34:16.958 align:start position:0%
get this bill done
 
06:34:19.110 --> 06:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
to make bottled water as safe as it can
 
06:34:19.120 --> 06:34:19.830 align:start position:0%
to make bottled water as safe as it can
be

06:34:19.830 --> 06:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:34:23.270 --> 06:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
and signal the industry um that this is
 
06:34:25.270 --> 06:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
where new hampshire stands
 
06:34:27.190 --> 06:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
move ahead with the rulemaking which is
 
06:34:29.510 --> 06:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
great but limited to only a few
 
06:34:32.230 --> 06:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
substances at a time and kind of has to
 
06:34:35.030 --> 06:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
work in reverse almost um
 
06:34:36.628 --> 06:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:34:39.590 --> 06:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
then my suggestion is to go forward
 
06:34:39.600 --> 06:34:40.468 align:start position:0%
then my suggestion is to go forward
and

06:34:40.468 --> 06:34:40.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:34:42.230 --> 06:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
continue with the
 
06:34:42.240 --> 06:34:43.350 align:start position:0%
continue with the
liquids

06:34:43.350 --> 06:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
liquids
 
06:34:43.360 --> 06:34:46.230 align:start position:0%
liquids
safety

06:34:46.230 --> 06:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:46.240 --> 06:34:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
guidelines

06:34:47.830 --> 06:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
06:34:50.390 --> 06:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
for the next bill that you might have
 
06:34:55.590 --> 06:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:57.510 --> 06:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay um if you're willing to take a
 
06:34:59.510 --> 06:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
question uh representative emman has
 
06:35:07.590 --> 06:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:08.948 --> 06:35:08.958 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now
 
06:35:11.110 --> 06:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes we can yeah thank you for taking my
 
06:35:12.628 --> 06:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
question uh i guess i was trying to
 
06:35:12.638 --> 06:35:13.750 align:start position:0%
question uh i guess i was trying to
understand

06:35:13.750 --> 06:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
understand
 
06:35:15.750 --> 06:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
how you would like this bill to be
 
06:35:17.350 --> 06:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
expanded and i was trying to think of
 
06:35:20.390 --> 06:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
what other products might this apply to
 
06:35:21.990 --> 06:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
would it apply to things like beer
 
06:35:24.230 --> 06:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of water and beer
 
06:35:26.868 --> 06:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
or water ice water ice has a lot of
 
06:35:28.530 --> 06:35:28.540 align:start position:0%
water in it
 
06:35:28.540 --> 06:35:30.070 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
06:35:31.590 --> 06:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
i was just trying to think of what all
 
06:35:33.110 --> 06:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
this might
 
06:35:34.948 --> 06:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
apply to is just so that we make sure
 
06:35:36.310 --> 06:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
everyone is
 
06:35:37.350 --> 06:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:35:40.070 --> 06:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
applies to safety first
 
06:35:42.628 --> 06:35:42.638 align:start position:0%
right so all i'm saying is is that i my
 
06:35:43.910 --> 06:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion is
 
06:35:46.310 --> 06:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
let's get the first thing done and the
 
06:35:48.708 --> 06:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
bill as it's written
 
06:35:51.190 --> 06:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
again with that clarification of of
 
06:35:54.708 --> 06:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
where the bot water is made and sold
 
06:35:57.510 --> 06:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
that was suggested by a previous speaker
 
06:35:59.750 --> 06:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
that is fine so i suggest you move ahead
 
06:36:02.390 --> 06:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
with this bill for this legislative
 
06:36:02.400 --> 06:36:03.910 align:start position:0%
with this bill for this legislative
session

06:36:03.910 --> 06:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
session
 
06:36:03.920 --> 06:36:04.868 align:start position:0%
session
then

06:36:04.868 --> 06:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:36:08.070 --> 06:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
in another legislative session
 
06:36:09.750 --> 06:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
i suggest
 
06:36:12.868 --> 06:36:12.878 align:start position:0%
this committee or other committees
 
06:36:14.468 --> 06:36:14.478 align:start position:0%
would look into
 
06:36:17.350 --> 06:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
the idea of securing
 
06:36:17.360 --> 06:36:18.628 align:start position:0%
the idea of securing
standards

06:36:18.628 --> 06:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
standards
 
06:36:18.638 --> 06:36:19.830 align:start position:0%
standards
for

06:36:19.830 --> 06:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:36:23.030 --> 06:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
finished liquid products that are drawn
 
06:36:23.040 --> 06:36:23.910 align:start position:0%
finished liquid products that are drawn
from

06:36:23.910 --> 06:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:36:27.110 --> 06:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire waters that's
 
06:36:27.120 --> 06:36:27.430 align:start position:0%
new hampshire waters that's
okay all

06:36:27.430 --> 06:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
06:36:29.430 --> 06:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
another session
 
06:36:31.750 --> 06:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
right but he's asking you such as beer
 
06:36:34.230 --> 06:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
like are you worried about beer
 
06:36:36.948 --> 06:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
well i have to look into the issue of
 
06:36:38.628 --> 06:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
beer and whether or not there's already
 
06:36:40.788 --> 06:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
legislation associated with the
 
06:36:44.070 --> 06:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
standards associated with beer
 
06:36:46.548 --> 06:36:46.558 align:start position:0%
chemistry i
 
06:36:48.390 --> 06:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of that legislation right
 
06:36:50.310 --> 06:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
now so i'd have to say let's look into
 
06:36:52.708 --> 06:36:52.718 align:start position:0%
it for another legislative session
 
06:36:54.788 --> 06:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
okay so what other water products do you
 
06:36:57.830 --> 06:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
think is that you do are aware of
 
06:37:01.750 --> 06:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah i i only know this build so
 
06:37:05.030 --> 06:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:06.548 --> 06:37:06.558 align:start position:0%
right so i just want to work with one
 
06:37:08.390 --> 06:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
thing at a time maybe i should have made
 
06:37:10.310 --> 06:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
that suggestion for next year open up
 
06:37:11.830 --> 06:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
canada worms like that that's for next
 
06:37:13.750 --> 06:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
year that's for next year please next
 
06:37:13.760 --> 06:37:14.628 align:start position:0%
year that's for next year please next
year

06:37:14.628 --> 06:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:37:16.628 --> 06:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
okay so we do have questions you'll be
 
06:37:18.628 --> 06:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
willing to take some questions
 
06:37:23.270 --> 06:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
and uh representative bartlett is first
 
06:37:25.350 --> 06:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i got a little confused on the
 
06:37:28.230 --> 06:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
direction you were going here um
 
06:37:29.830 --> 06:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to ask your
 
06:37:31.750 --> 06:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
question one of the things our sign up
 
06:37:33.830 --> 06:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
sheets um don't allow for or our
 
06:37:36.548 --> 06:37:36.558 align:start position:0%
testimony is where people are from
 
06:37:39.670 --> 06:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
um and with the virtual um
 
06:37:41.430 --> 06:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
with our remote um
 
06:37:43.830 --> 06:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
type hearings these days um we're
 
06:37:45.990 --> 06:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
getting people from further and further
 
06:37:48.070 --> 06:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
away can i just ask where you're from
 
06:37:51.430 --> 06:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
oh yes i have lived here in dover for um
 
06:37:53.510 --> 06:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
over a year
 
06:37:54.628 --> 06:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
does that help
 
06:37:56.310 --> 06:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:37:57.590 --> 06:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
sure is i'm sorry i should have said
 
06:37:59.430 --> 06:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
that when i started it's okay thanks
 
06:38:00.948 --> 06:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
very much
 
06:38:03.190 --> 06:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay so chuck i'm gonna let you go last
 
06:38:05.270 --> 06:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
because it's sort of a wrap up so but uh
 
06:38:07.430 --> 06:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
so we'll go uh representative abramson
 
06:38:10.548 --> 06:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:12.230 --> 06:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
i assume you're asking this question to
 
06:38:12.240 --> 06:38:13.110 align:start position:0%
i assume you're asking this question to
um

06:38:13.110 --> 06:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:14.468 --> 06:38:14.478 align:start position:0%
miss walter
 
06:38:16.868 --> 06:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
yeah um that that
 
06:38:18.788 --> 06:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
uh beer question did bring up another
 
06:38:20.468 --> 06:38:20.478 align:start position:0%
issue there are a lot of
 
06:38:23.110 --> 06:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
bottled water products that are
 
06:38:25.430 --> 06:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
have very light flavoring or very light
 
06:38:25.440 --> 06:38:27.030 align:start position:0%
have very light flavoring or very light
coloring

06:38:27.030 --> 06:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
coloring
 
06:38:28.628 --> 06:38:28.638 align:start position:0%
if somebody is trying to i always think
 
06:38:30.070 --> 06:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
of rules in terms of somebody's trying
 
06:38:31.670 --> 06:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
to weasel out of it they have water that
 
06:38:34.390 --> 06:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass that could they you know
 
06:38:36.310 --> 06:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
kind of weasel out of this role just by
 
06:38:38.548 --> 06:38:38.558 align:start position:0%
adding some coloring or sugar or
 
06:38:41.030 --> 06:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
something else and then selling it as uh
 
06:38:43.030 --> 06:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know like a crystal like type of
 
06:38:46.390 --> 06:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:48.788 --> 06:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
would would this role apply to
 
06:38:50.788 --> 06:38:50.798 align:start position:0%
colored and flavored products
 
06:38:52.230 --> 06:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think she would be able to
 
06:38:53.750 --> 06:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
answer that question but i'm sure chuck
 
06:38:55.910 --> 06:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
will try to stat take a stab at it when
 
06:38:58.150 --> 06:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
when i invite him back up
 
06:38:58.160 --> 06:38:59.110 align:start position:0%
when i invite him back up
uh

06:38:59.110 --> 06:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:39:01.910 --> 06:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
in representative fargo you still got a
 
06:39:01.920 --> 06:39:03.430 align:start position:0%
in representative fargo you still got a
question

06:39:03.430 --> 06:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:39:05.910 --> 06:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman it's more of a
 
06:39:08.708 --> 06:39:08.718 align:start position:0%
would you believe um cynthia walter is
 
06:39:10.868 --> 06:39:10.878 align:start position:0%
from my ward here in dover so i just
 
06:39:12.390 --> 06:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
want to say that if she would like to
 
06:39:14.628 --> 06:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
talk to me about further legislation i
 
06:39:16.948 --> 06:39:16.958 align:start position:0%
would be open to having that discussion
 
06:39:19.670 --> 06:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay so call your rep cynthia
 
06:39:21.830 --> 06:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes thanks
 
06:39:23.830 --> 06:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
all right i think i'm getting everybody
 
06:39:26.390 --> 06:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to um allow
 
06:39:28.230 --> 06:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative gracie to have the last
 
06:39:30.468 --> 06:39:30.478 align:start position:0%
word i i just didn't want to respond to
 
06:39:32.788 --> 06:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
that last question about uh other types
 
06:39:35.270 --> 06:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
of water that she brought up and one of
 
06:39:37.510 --> 06:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
the things that the consumer reports
 
06:39:39.670 --> 06:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
studies and both times they stated was
 
06:39:41.270 --> 06:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
that it tells the waters
 
06:39:43.910 --> 06:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
a very have very high contaminated
 
06:39:45.990 --> 06:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
levels far above what we would allow in
 
06:39:48.150 --> 06:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
any of our waters here in new hampshire
 
06:39:50.468 --> 06:39:50.478 align:start position:0%
that's another day that's another story
 
06:39:52.150 --> 06:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know when representative
 
06:39:54.070 --> 06:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
abramson's question about if they added
 
06:39:56.150 --> 06:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit of coloring to it i don't
 
06:39:56.160 --> 06:39:57.190 align:start position:0%
a little bit of coloring to it i don't
know

06:39:57.190 --> 06:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:39:58.390 --> 06:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's something i would have to talk to
 
06:40:02.150 --> 06:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
dhs about but certainly in my research
 
06:40:03.670 --> 06:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
when i noticed that
 
06:40:05.190 --> 06:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know we dealt with water this was a
 
06:40:06.788 --> 06:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
bill that came in as you said six years
 
06:40:08.230 --> 06:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
ago when we were just trying to move
 
06:40:09.750 --> 06:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
this through because it died on the
 
06:40:11.350 --> 06:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
floor last year
 
06:40:13.430 --> 06:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
delsa waters may be something different
 
06:40:15.110 --> 06:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
that we have to take a look at i don't
 
06:40:15.120 --> 06:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
that we have to take a look at i don't
know

06:40:15.990 --> 06:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:40:17.750 --> 06:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
and if it is we will be bringing in a
 
06:40:19.110 --> 06:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
bill that will deal with that because
 
06:40:21.510 --> 06:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
certainly they found some significant
 
06:40:23.670 --> 06:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
contaminations particularly with pfas
 
06:40:26.468 --> 06:40:26.478 align:start position:0%
and arsenic in selsa waters
 
06:40:28.310 --> 06:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
don't even have to go to beer and we may
 
06:40:30.788 --> 06:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
not want to go there but um ruin it for
 
06:40:33.510 --> 06:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
all of us uh but the thing is is that
 
06:40:35.030 --> 06:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
those are something we may want to take
 
06:40:37.910 --> 06:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking at health products here
 
06:40:39.430 --> 06:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
things that people look at as being
 
06:40:41.590 --> 06:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
healthy and pure some people like a
 
06:40:43.350 --> 06:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
little fizz in their water not an
 
06:40:45.430 --> 06:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol product
 
06:40:47.350 --> 06:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:40:47.360 --> 06:40:48.788 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
okay

06:40:48.788 --> 06:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:40:51.670 --> 06:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um all right well with that we
 
06:40:53.990 --> 06:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
will uh close the public hearing and
 
06:40:57.270 --> 06:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
then i will read the numbers here
 
06:41:00.788 --> 06:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
uh we had 148 in support
 
06:41:02.788 --> 06:41:02.798 align:start position:0%
11 opposed
 
06:41:05.110 --> 06:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
two are neutral
