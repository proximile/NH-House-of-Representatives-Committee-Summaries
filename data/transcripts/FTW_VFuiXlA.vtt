00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
you um you know I forgot what I was to
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
say you know what what you said is
 
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
really important I mean I sat on the
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
advisory committee for a long and the OT
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and um you kind of feel
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
like you're on an island and and I I we
 
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
I have not talked to people in the
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
medical board yet but I would bet that
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
they would might actually appreciate
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
everything you just
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
said I think the medical board does a
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
great job I think the providers uh in
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
the state are doing a great job I think
 
00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
most hospitals and he Healthcare systems
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
are doing a great job there are outliers
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
that we have to be able to identify if
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
is all I'm saying and I think the way we
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
can get at it is through a committee
 
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
that will be able to understand the
 
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
process and maybe make recommendations
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
maybe not but if there's if the only
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation that came out of it was
 
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
the um Board of Medicine is underst
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
staffed and cannot handle the
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
information that is given to them that
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
would be one thing if the reporting from
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
a Health Care provider's office or an
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
institution or a hospital whatever is
 
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
inadequate we have to understand and
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
what is it that the bare minimum has to
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
be reported and by whom from these
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
institutions maybe not from the CEO's
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
office not in the SE Suite maybe it
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
comes from the medical review board in
 
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
the hospital maybe it comes from you
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
know the um Quality review Boards of any
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
hospital or practice but we we have to
 
00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
better understand how the process
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
happens how the information is garnered
 
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:54.519 align:start position:0%
in the in the healthare setting and then
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
given to the Board of Medicine to make
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
determinations and also to assist them
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
in understanding the information in
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
getting to the bottom line and there
 
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
therefore recommendations to the
 
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
oversight HHS oversight could then
 
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
possibly be
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
made so that would be my two cents I I
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
totally agree and I I don't know what
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
the process of this is but about making
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
motions as a committee do we need to
 
00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:22.839 align:start position:0%
make motions or do we just say that
 
00:11:22.839 --> 00:11:27.949 align:start position:0%
make motions or do we just say that
that's

00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:34.990 align:start position:0%
 
our

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
that oh so there's a note that comes out
 
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.550 align:start position:0%
that oh so there's a note that comes out
of

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:52.949 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
folder

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay um one thing having the idea of a
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
an thing 15 minutes before the uh full
 
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
committee meeting I think represented
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
McDonald's already planned one based on
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
so it we'd have to be careful about that
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise um and that one that's on the
 
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.829 align:start position:0%
otherwise um and that one that's on the
organ

00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
donation I would say at this point in
 
00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
time given the gravity of what can
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
happen with an all I don't disagree that
 
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
most of it probably works fine but we're
 
00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with what happens when we have
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
outliers and what's the process to
 
00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
identify an outlier and what's the
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
process to report that and right now I
 
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
don't understand it well enough to begin
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
to understand what needs to be done to
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
have somebody from an agency come and
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
saying they solved the problem
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
everything's fine I'd like to have the
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
committee Explore More into that and
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
understanding okay what did you do do
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
you need more resources to the Board of
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
Medicine um what's the reporting
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
requirements and that's what I'm trying
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
to get to I think the committee can
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
tease those things out that you would
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
not have
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise I I would fully agree and
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
support that because I also think that
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of comes out of oplc you know
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
testimony if they were to present to us
 
00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519 align:start position:0%
I I still think we would want to have a
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
committee that can say okay thank you
 
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
for that you've done a great job you've
 
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
updated us but we still need to
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
understand better the processes within
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
the hospital in the reporting system the
 
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine their Staffing what do
 
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
they need for support etc etc it's going
 
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
to Sunset by this 322 in 2 years anyway
 
00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
but at least maybe we'll get some
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
information and again my concern is just
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
bottom line patient quality care and um
 
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
and I I I think like I said I I think
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
that most providers most Healthcare
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
organizations the Board of Medicine
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
everybody involved taking care of
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
patients in this state does a great job
 
00:13:58.990 --> 00:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to protect this from the
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
outlier and also to bring back trust for
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
the public to healthc care and to the
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
Medicine if I could add a comment I I
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
think one of the comments that I've
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%
heard over and over again whether it's
 
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
deserved or not was a lack of faith in
 
00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:19.959 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine and if nothing
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
else maybe this can help improve their
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
standing and I I was kind of taken aback
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
by that to be honest but this was coming
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
from not Medical people within our own
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
committee so um so would our
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation as a group then be that
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
we would still want to consider the
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
committee as a recommendation from
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
322 and it would be nice to hear from
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
oplc that gives us a little bit more
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
information but I still feel that a
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
committee um as structured two you know
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
Senators three House of Representatives
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
would be very good to bring in the
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate people from hospital from
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
provid ERS from Board of Medicine and
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
then come up with an understanding of
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
process and any recommendations that
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
follow after
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
that the other thing too is that if it
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
leaves the house with ond to pass and
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
comes out of the house it's also going
 
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:16.759 align:start position:0%
to have a full Hearing in the Senate M
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have opportunities at
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
a point in time to have the Senate weigh
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
on it and have hearing at the Senate
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
level and if we hear all the things that
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
we should hear and it does look like
 
00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:28.759 align:start position:0%
it's going the right direction the the
 
00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
Senate at that point in time could vote
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
to itl it right so I think at this point
 
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
in time to kill it this early in its
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
journey is premature I
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
agree I
 
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
agree that makes sense to me too because
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
if it turns out to really be unnecessary
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
it there there are plenty of places time
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.829 align:start position:0%
 
way

00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
so do we need to oh go ahead so I don't
 
00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
sure exactly what the process and what
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
the procedure is going to be but there a
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
couple of things I wanted to amend in
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
the bill I would like to consider four
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
house two from the HHS possibly two from
 
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.550 align:start position:0%
house two from the HHS possibly two from

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
Edna and one from each party to be sure
 
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
this is nonpartisan or at least
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
bipartisan two members from the Senate
 
00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519 align:start position:0%
but the other thing I picked up on
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
was under line 15 where it says
 
00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
Association of nurses it should be
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
Association in my opinion of nurse
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
practitioners they're the ones I think
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
that really um should be at the table
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
versus a nothing is a registered nurse
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
but they're not at the same level as far
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
as hospital privileges and so forth
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
practitioner you can do both yeah I
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
think nurses in the hospital
 
00:17:03.029 --> 00:17:03.039 align:start position:0%
they're the ones you ask
 
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:07.959 align:start position:0%
ask we all know what they do
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
so no I I agree with you totally
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
and I think this is what I'm struggling
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
with because this case was a hospital
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
issue but we're not just dealing with
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
Hospital issues um so I think I mean the
 
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
only thing I'm struggling with as a
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
husband of a nurse practitioner and I
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
practitioners I mean one thing I've
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
learned from this process is not
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
overburdening committees with numbers
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
and um um I mean do we need to include
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
Pas then too that's what I'm getting at
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
because there's a huge you know I look
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
at the difference I see represent Nel is
 
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that a nurse practitioner does
 
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
have independent practice and therefore
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
the oversight is not there like you do
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
with a pa pa does have position
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
oversight um so they for they're like
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
each other but they are fundamentally
 
00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:04.950 align:start position:0%
each other but they are fundamentally
different

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
but aren't they they aren't regulated by
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine they're regulated
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
by the nursing association correct but
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
so I don't mean that you wouldn't value
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
their input but it is a different I mean
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
it is different as opposed to Pas who
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
are supervised directly by us corre but
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
back the same thing if you're on Private
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
Practice sometimes this is hospital
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
right now but I think it needs to be
 
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
broader than just the hospital and
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
therefore if you have nurse
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
practitioners out there on the own then
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
how do that get pulled into it because
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's a separate type of practice setting
 
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
I do agree with what you're saying about
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
the nurse inside of the hospital they
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
probably know more about what's going on
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
than anyone else but I want to be sure
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
we don't somehow exclude the nurse
 
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
practitioners in in the process because
 
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately there could be issues there
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
as well so so my question would be then
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
uh because obviously you don't have a
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
draft of that would be we'd want to just
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
pass this on to the full committee and
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
then you could draft a a an amendment to
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
be considered at the committee so today
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
all we need to do really is just yeah
 
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
what and what were those recommendations
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
or those changes that you wanted I saw I
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
saw uh well four house members four
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
house members two from HHS and
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
EA two from Edna because that's who the
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
boards are one from each party majority
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
and minority and then in the Senate be
 
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
two members from the Senate again one
 
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:45.799 align:start position:0%
from each party try to make this truly
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
bipartison right what with each of the
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
two committees um Health Human Services
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
and LLY Affairs yeah and and two from
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
executive departments Administration one
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
HHS person would be Democrat one a
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
republican is
 
00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:03.559 align:start position:0%
that gota the same thing with the Edna
 
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:12.919 align:start position:0%
sure and I'm if you want to leave it
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
with the nursing association I think
 
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
they definitely have a role here um but
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
I think also npor should be somehow
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
identified as well
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
um right but if you leave it with the
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
nursing association then they could pick
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
which they
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
want they could that's true but I would
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
be concerned that they would not pick a
 
00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:35.630 align:start position:0%
be concerned that they would not pick a
nurse

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
nurse
 
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
practitioner I think you are totally
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
correct and I think you do need to
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I know that the that medicine in
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
general has has you know we have to be
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
careful that it's not looking like we're
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
going to try to regulate nurse
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
practitioners because that's U that's
 
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.110 align:start position:0%
practitioners because that's U that's
been

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.669 align:start position:0%
been
a

00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
represent Palmer that's definitely been
 
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
a point of contention I think if we
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
include the nurse practition we can
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
minimize that as well so my question is
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
with those changes which are not really
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
substantively you know big changes those
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
changes that are not substantively you
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
know major changes just making a change
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
in the makeup of the committee can that
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
just go right to the committee for
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
Action it doesn't have to have another
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
PLL public hearing or anything like that
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:28.909 align:start position:0%
PLL public hearing or anything like that
great

00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
you so if I put through an amendment to
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
322 with the changes I talked
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
about can I ask you folks to co-sponsor
 
00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:45.990 align:start position:0%
about can I ask you folks to co-sponsor
the

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
amendment thank
 
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:57.029 align:start position:0%
amendment thank
you

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:04.669 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
322 so I will call this hearing closed
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
so then I need to know what I need to do
 
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
so I just fill this form out that we
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
basically said autop pass do I need to
 
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
put any substantive discussion as to why
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
we want why we feel the way we do or
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
just circle
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
all right and then um the amendment part
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
do I need to put that in here too um no
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.310 align:start position:0%
that it
was

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
okay and then I fill this I'll give it
 
00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:50.070 align:start position:0%
okay and then I fill this I'll give it
to

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
right
