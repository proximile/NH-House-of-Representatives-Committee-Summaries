00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
Pas then too that's what I'm getting at
 

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:47.270 align:start position:0%
Pas then too that's what I'm getting at
because<00:17:45.000><c> there's</c><00:17:45.160><c> a</c><00:17:45.400><c> huge</c><00:17:45.760><c> you</c><00:17:46.000><c> know</c><00:17:47.000><c> I</c><00:17:47.120><c> look</c>

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
because there's a huge you know I look
 

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.750 align:start position:0%
because there's a huge you know I look
at<00:17:47.640><c> the</c><00:17:47.799><c> difference</c><00:17:48.080><c> I</c><00:17:48.200><c> see</c><00:17:48.799><c> represent</c><00:17:49.240><c> Nel</c><00:17:49.559><c> is</c>

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
at the difference I see represent Nel is
 

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.390 align:start position:0%
at the difference I see represent Nel is
the<00:17:49.919><c> fact</c><00:17:50.120><c> that</c><00:17:50.280><c> a</c><00:17:50.400><c> nurse</c><00:17:50.720><c> practitioner</c><00:17:51.200><c> does</c>

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that a nurse practitioner does
 

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.950 align:start position:0%
the fact that a nurse practitioner does
have<00:17:51.559><c> independent</c><00:17:52.160><c> practice</c><00:17:53.160><c> and</c><00:17:53.520><c> therefore</c>

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
have independent practice and therefore
 

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.990 align:start position:0%
have independent practice and therefore
the<00:17:54.160><c> oversight</c><00:17:55.000><c> is</c><00:17:55.159><c> not</c><00:17:55.400><c> there</c><00:17:55.600><c> like</c><00:17:55.720><c> you</c><00:17:55.840><c> do</c>

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
the oversight is not there like you do
 

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.710 align:start position:0%
the oversight is not there like you do
with<00:17:56.120><c> a</c><00:17:56.240><c> pa</c><00:17:56.640><c> pa</c><00:17:56.919><c> does</c><00:17:57.120><c> have</c><00:17:57.320><c> position</c>

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
with a pa pa does have position
 

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.350 align:start position:0%
with a pa pa does have position
oversight<00:17:58.840><c> um</c><00:17:59.159><c> so</c><00:17:59.600><c> they</c><00:18:00.000><c> for</c><00:18:00.200><c> they're</c><00:18:01.120><c> like</c>

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
oversight um so they for they're like
 

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.789 align:start position:0%
oversight um so they for they're like
each<00:18:01.520><c> other</c><00:18:01.840><c> but</c><00:18:01.960><c> they</c><00:18:02.039><c> are</c><00:18:02.200><c> fundamentally</c>

00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
each other but they are fundamentally
 

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:04.950 align:start position:0%
each other but they are fundamentally
different

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
different
 

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.870 align:start position:0%
different
but<00:18:05.960><c> aren't</c><00:18:06.360><c> they</c><00:18:06.760><c> they</c><00:18:06.880><c> aren't</c><00:18:07.200><c> regulated</c><00:18:07.760><c> by</c>

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
but aren't they they aren't regulated by
 

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.549 align:start position:0%
but aren't they they aren't regulated by
the<00:18:08.000><c> Board</c><00:18:08.159><c> of</c><00:18:08.320><c> Medicine</c><00:18:08.760><c> they're</c><00:18:09.000><c> regulated</c>

00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine they're regulated
 

00:18:09.559 --> 00:18:13.070 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine they're regulated
by<00:18:09.760><c> the</c><00:18:10.480><c> nursing</c><00:18:11.480><c> association</c><00:18:12.320><c> correct</c><00:18:12.720><c> but</c>

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
by the nursing association correct but
 

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.630 align:start position:0%
by the nursing association correct but
so<00:18:13.360><c> I</c><00:18:13.440><c> don't</c><00:18:13.559><c> mean</c><00:18:13.760><c> that</c><00:18:13.880><c> you</c><00:18:14.000><c> wouldn't</c><00:18:14.360><c> value</c>

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
so I don't mean that you wouldn't value
 

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.190 align:start position:0%
so I don't mean that you wouldn't value
their<00:18:14.799><c> input</c><00:18:15.200><c> but</c><00:18:15.320><c> it</c><00:18:15.440><c> is</c><00:18:15.559><c> a</c><00:18:15.960><c> different</c><00:18:16.960><c> I</c><00:18:17.200><c> mean</c>

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
their input but it is a different I mean
 

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.350 align:start position:0%
their input but it is a different I mean
it<00:18:18.400><c> is</c><00:18:18.600><c> different</c><00:18:18.919><c> as</c><00:18:19.080><c> opposed</c><00:18:19.679><c> to</c><00:18:20.679><c> Pas</c><00:18:21.200><c> who</c>

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
it is different as opposed to Pas who
 

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.390 align:start position:0%
it is different as opposed to Pas who
are<00:18:22.120><c> supervised</c><00:18:22.840><c> directly</c><00:18:23.320><c> by</c><00:18:23.559><c> us</c><00:18:24.679><c> corre</c><00:18:25.679><c> but</c>

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
are supervised directly by us corre but
 

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.789 align:start position:0%
are supervised directly by us corre but
back<00:18:26.640><c> the</c><00:18:26.720><c> same</c><00:18:26.919><c> thing</c><00:18:27.080><c> if</c><00:18:27.159><c> you're</c><00:18:27.240><c> on</c><00:18:27.440><c> Private</c>

00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
back the same thing if you're on Private
 

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:29.710 align:start position:0%
back the same thing if you're on Private
Practice<00:18:28.600><c> sometimes</c><00:18:28.799><c> this</c><00:18:28.960><c> is</c><00:18:29.200><c> hospital</c>

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
Practice sometimes this is hospital
 

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.110 align:start position:0%
Practice sometimes this is hospital
right<00:18:29.880><c> now</c><00:18:30.120><c> but</c><00:18:30.240><c> I</c><00:18:30.360><c> think</c><00:18:30.480><c> it</c><00:18:30.640><c> needs</c><00:18:30.840><c> to</c><00:18:30.960><c> be</c>

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
right now but I think it needs to be
 

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.070 align:start position:0%
right now but I think it needs to be
broader<00:18:31.520><c> than</c><00:18:31.679><c> just</c><00:18:31.799><c> the</c><00:18:31.960><c> hospital</c><00:18:32.919><c> and</c>

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
broader than just the hospital and
 

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.390 align:start position:0%
broader than just the hospital and
therefore<00:18:33.559><c> if</c><00:18:33.679><c> you</c><00:18:33.840><c> have</c><00:18:34.039><c> nurse</c>

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
therefore if you have nurse
 

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.029 align:start position:0%
therefore if you have nurse
practitioners<00:18:35.000><c> out</c><00:18:35.280><c> there</c><00:18:36.000><c> on</c><00:18:36.280><c> the</c><00:18:36.760><c> own</c><00:18:37.760><c> then</c>

00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
practitioners out there on the own then
 

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:39.870 align:start position:0%
practitioners out there on the own then
how<00:18:38.200><c> do</c><00:18:38.440><c> that</c><00:18:38.600><c> get</c><00:18:38.760><c> pulled</c><00:18:39.039><c> into</c><00:18:39.320><c> it</c><00:18:39.559><c> because</c>

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
how do that get pulled into it because
 

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.230 align:start position:0%
how do that get pulled into it because
it's<00:18:40.000><c> a</c><00:18:40.240><c> separate</c><00:18:40.799><c> type</c><00:18:40.960><c> of</c><00:18:41.200><c> practice</c><00:18:41.559><c> setting</c>

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's a separate type of practice setting
 

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.710 align:start position:0%
it's a separate type of practice setting
I<00:18:42.360><c> do</c><00:18:42.600><c> agree</c><00:18:42.880><c> with</c><00:18:43.039><c> what</c><00:18:43.120><c> you're</c><00:18:43.280><c> saying</c><00:18:43.520><c> about</c>

I do agree with what you're saying about
 

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.390 align:start position:0%
I do agree with what you're saying about

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
the nurse inside of the hospital they
 

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.270 align:start position:0%
the nurse inside of the hospital they
probably<00:18:45.720><c> know</c><00:18:46.039><c> more</c><00:18:46.480><c> about</c><00:18:46.679><c> what's</c><00:18:46.919><c> going</c><00:18:47.080><c> on</c>

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
probably know more about what's going on
 

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.870 align:start position:0%

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%

we<00:18:50.960><c> don't</c><00:18:51.200><c> somehow</c><00:18:51.520><c> exclude</c><00:18:51.880><c> the</c><00:18:51.960><c> nurse</c>

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
we don't somehow exclude the nurse

we don't somehow exclude the nurse
practitioners<00:18:52.799><c> in</c><00:18:53.080><c> in</c><00:18:53.200><c> the</c><00:18:53.360><c> process</c><00:18:53.720><c> because</c>

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
practitioners in in the process because
 

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.950 align:start position:0%
practitioners in in the process because
ultimately<00:18:54.880><c> there</c><00:18:55.039><c> could</c><00:18:55.200><c> be</c><00:18:55.440><c> issues</c><00:18:55.799><c> there</c>

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately there could be issues there
 

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.110 align:start position:0%
ultimately there could be issues there
as<00:18:56.080><c> well</c><00:18:57.080><c> so</c><00:18:57.360><c> so</c><00:18:57.559><c> my</c><00:18:57.760><c> question</c><00:18:58.000><c> would</c><00:18:58.120><c> be</c><00:18:58.480><c> then</c>

00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
as well so so my question would be then
 

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.029 align:start position:0%
as well so so my question would be then
uh<00:18:59.679><c> because</c><00:19:00.559><c> obviously</c><00:19:00.919><c> you</c><00:19:01.039><c> don't</c><00:19:01.360><c> have</c><00:19:01.840><c> a</c>

00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
uh because obviously you don't have a
 

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:04.909 align:start position:0%
uh because obviously you don't have a
draft<00:19:02.400><c> of</c><00:19:02.600><c> that</c><00:19:02.840><c> would</c><00:19:03.080><c> be</c><00:19:04.080><c> we'd</c><00:19:04.320><c> want</c><00:19:04.480><c> to</c><00:19:04.679><c> just</c>

00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
draft of that would be we'd want to just
 

00:19:04.919 --> 00:19:07.669 align:start position:0%
draft of that would be we'd want to just
pass<00:19:05.240><c> this</c><00:19:05.400><c> on</c><00:19:05.760><c> to</c><00:19:05.960><c> the</c><00:19:06.039><c> full</c><00:19:06.520><c> committee</c><00:19:07.520><c> and</c>

00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
pass this on to the full committee and
 

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:12.630 align:start position:0%
pass this on to the full committee and
then<00:19:07.840><c> you</c><00:19:07.960><c> could</c><00:19:08.159><c> draft</c><00:19:08.960><c> a</c><00:19:09.919><c> a</c><00:19:10.919><c> an</c><00:19:11.480><c> amendment</c><00:19:12.480><c> to</c>

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
then you could draft a a an amendment to
 

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.750 align:start position:0%
then you could draft a a an amendment to
be<00:19:12.840><c> considered</c><00:19:13.559><c> at</c><00:19:13.720><c> the</c><00:19:13.840><c> committee</c><00:19:14.280><c> so</c><00:19:14.440><c> today</c>

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
be considered at the committee so today

with<00:20:13.159><c> the</c><00:20:13.280><c> nursing</c><00:20:13.760><c> association</c><00:20:14.320><c> I</c><00:20:14.400><c> think</c>

00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
with the nursing association I think
 

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:16.909 align:start position:0%
with the nursing association I think
they<00:20:14.679><c> definitely</c><00:20:15.039><c> have</c><00:20:15.159><c> a</c><00:20:15.320><c> role</c><00:20:15.640><c> here</c><00:20:16.480><c> um</c><00:20:16.799><c> but</c>

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
I think also npor should be somehow
 

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.070 align:start position:0%
I think also npor should be somehow
identified<00:20:19.760><c> as</c><00:20:20.159><c> well</c>

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.830 align:start position:0%
identified as well
um<00:20:23.080><c> right</c><00:20:23.320><c> but</c><00:20:24.080><c> if</c><00:20:24.159><c> you</c><00:20:24.280><c> leave</c><00:20:24.480><c> it</c><00:20:24.600><c> with</c><00:20:24.720><c> the</c>

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
um right but if you leave it with the
 

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.789 align:start position:0%
um right but if you leave it with the
nursing<00:20:25.200><c> association</c><00:20:25.799><c> then</c><00:20:26.000><c> they</c><00:20:26.159><c> could</c><00:20:26.919><c> pick</c>

00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%

include<00:21:02.960><c> the</c><00:21:03.039><c> nurse</c><00:21:03.360><c> practition</c><00:21:03.840><c> we</c><00:21:03.919><c> can</c>

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
include the nurse practition we can
 

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.310 align:start position:0%
include the nurse practition we can

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
minimize that as well so my question is
 

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.669 align:start position:0%
minimize that as well so my question is
