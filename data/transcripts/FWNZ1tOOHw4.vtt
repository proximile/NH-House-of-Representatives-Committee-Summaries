representative betty gay
 
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
i have allergies and that's from eating
 
00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
something with soy or milk in it
 
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
i've just passed out an amendment ols i
 
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
owe them big
 
00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
um it dawned on me when i was talking
 
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
with other attorneys
 
00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 align:start position:0%
who are reps and people who are affected
 
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
by family court but if we open in a
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
commission we already have professional
 
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.830 align:start position:0%
commission we already have professional
commissions

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
but we don't have one that's primarily
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
the people who are affected by
 
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
by the family court so the amendment
 
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
simply changes the members of the
 
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
commission to
 
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
form house members to senate members but
 
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
they're volunteers they're people who
 
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
are really interested they're not going
 
00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
to be hand-picked according to this by
 
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
the speaker or the president because
 
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
that's really hard they've already had
 
00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 align:start position:0%
to staff many commissions and they may
 
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
as well just ask for volunteers who are
 
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 align:start position:0%
really interested in the subject
 
00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
we ask for two domestic violence
 
00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:33.509 align:start position:0%

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
involved in family court an attorney
 
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 align:start position:0%

certified mental health therapists
 
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the change
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
i don't have to tell you that we have
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
issues with the family court most people
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
have been involved or have family
 
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 align:start position:0%

represents victims of domestic abuse and
 
00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
i thought this was the most interesting
 
00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.510 align:start position:0%
i thought this was the most interesting
thing

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.550 align:start position:0%
thing
on

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
the website
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's 12 misconceptions about domestic
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
abuse that were set in the 70s and the
 
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
courts haven't changed and there's been
 
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of research since then so this
 
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.629 align:start position:0%
a lot of research since then so this
addresses

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
these 12 rare events that unfortunately
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
the courts think are standard
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
then the pink
 
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
testimony from a woman who spent
 
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
seven years in family court
 
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.230 align:start position:0%
seven years in family court
and

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
she would you believe today
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
is when her parents
 
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.590 align:start position:0%
is when her parents
house

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
contents are being delivered to her
 
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.029 align:start position:0%
contents are being delivered to her
house

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
so she couldn't come
 
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
so she spent a lot of effort all her
 
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
testimony she she sent testimony very
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
short testimony on several bills so i
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
printed them all on pink
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
so you can see it she's also kind of at
 
00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
risk because she's still in the court
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
system to say anything critical
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
so that's why her name's not on here
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
so thank you for reading it it's really
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
heartfelt and she's very intelligent
 
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
compassionate person
 
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%

thank you for allowing me to speak uh i
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
just have some brief comments i don't
 
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
have written testimony i'm from hollis
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
i'm a state rep there in hollis and i
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that a year ago the
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
family court system wasn't on my radar
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
but there was a couple constituents
 
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
who've actually brought some
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
brought some issues to my attention at
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
that time and it was at that time
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
centered around the judge intracaso
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
issue as you may all recall judge
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
intracaso was the family court judge who
 
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.029 align:start position:0%
intracaso was the family court judge who
was

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
convicted of falsifying documents
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
and it was it could be a felony it could
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
be a misdemeanor as it turned out
 
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
i was actually at that sentencing
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
hearing it was decided it was going to
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
be a
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
lo and behold go figure a misdemeanor
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
with no jail time and the precedent they
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
court judge who was actually also
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
convicted of something that could have
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
been a felony that got a misdemeanor
 
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's slightly erroneous to what this
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
bill is but it
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
when i started getting involved in
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
looking at things i try to look at
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
things in a wide angle so when i was
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the judge intercasso case i
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
was actually talking to the assistant
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
attorney general i was talking to the
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
judiciary code
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
conduct committee and i was trying to
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
really understand it
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i was
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
surprised to find in all of my research
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
was actually there was quite a few
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
people in my town who actually were in
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
the family court system and had some
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
very heartbreaking situations things
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
that they were currently happening in
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
their family and they were left to
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
that was the reason that i decided to
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
to participate with representative gay
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that came
 
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.589 align:start position:0%
one of the things that came
that

00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
is pretty clear to me now is that there
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
are there's a need for a look
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
there's a need for a look there's a need
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
to lift up the rock a little bit and see
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
what exactly is going on in family court
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
system because since that judge in
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
tricasto case we've actually had other
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
situations where we've had a marital
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
master have an issue we've had issues
 
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
with the gal
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of hard-working
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
wonderful people working in the family
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
court system that do yeoman's work
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
there have been enough issues from
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
people that you'll hear today
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
that it just does deserves a little bit
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
more oversight
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things about that i've
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
learned about the judicial conduct
 
00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:39.589 align:start position:0%
learned about the judicial conduct
committee

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
while they are very thorough and they do
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
great work
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
they have a very narrow scope in which
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
they can look at things and they look at
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
things with only regard to does this
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
violate this or that there's a lot of
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
things that seem to be falling outside
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
of that area that they
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
they cannot look into and that's why
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's our responsibility
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have does anyone have
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%

amendment
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
next we have a
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
good morning mr head i see here that
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
you're asking for 10 minutes
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
a huge stack of cards
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
do you think you could keep it to five i
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
obviously thank you kindly um and some
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
of what i'm going to talk about today
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
relates to some of the bills generally
 
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
that you'll be hearing today so
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
my first opportunity to talk to you
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit longer than some of
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
the later ones uh because i won't repeat
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
myself relative to the other bills
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
if you if you could just keep it to this
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
bill we'd appreciate that sir absolutely
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you kindly so my name is richard
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
head i'm the government affairs
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the judicial branch
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
um one of the things i just want to
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
clarify and it's it's a common theme i
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
think is
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
there is no family court anymore
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
there is now a family division in 2011
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
consolidated and created the circuit
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
court and the circuit court has a uh has
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
family division has probate division and
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
has district division
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
and judges in the circuit court sit in
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
all three divisions so there's no
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
with with some exceptions so there used
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
to be a marital master system
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
and in in the same statute in 2011
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
the decision was made to start phasing
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
out marital masters so as marital
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
masters retired
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
those by statute uh could become uh
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
judges instead of masters we currently
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
with the resignation of master delphra
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
we have one marital master currently in
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
and when master cooper retires uh the
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
met there will no longer be any marital
 
00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.509 align:start position:0%
met there will no longer be any marital
masters

00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
masters
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
so in the in the circuit court with with
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
again some limited exceptions judges sit
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
in all types of cases
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
and you have roughly in the circuit
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
division 125 000 cases
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
that are heard
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
that are filed each year
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the family division they're roughly
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh 19 000 new cases
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
in roughly 5 400 cases that are reopened
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
so in the family division itself we're
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
talking about 25 000 cases
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
so it just sort of put it puts into into
 
00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:11.590 align:start position:0%
so it just sort of put it puts into into
context

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
context
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
so what we're talking about when we're
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
talking family division because we no
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
longer have a family court system in a
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
dedicated family court
 
00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:23.670 align:start position:0%
dedicated family court
process

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
in in in
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
in sort of within that we have 47
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
full-time judges that manage that 125
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
000 caseload
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
so it's a significant caseload that
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
these judges are working under the one
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
marital master we have two senior judges
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
and nine referees i think although once
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
you get into the seniors those are
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
retired judges under 70 and the retired
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
referees are over 70 are no longer able
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
to act as judges
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
and and they work essentially
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
on a volunteer basis they're paid but
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
but they work at
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
their own schedule they're not a
 
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.269 align:start position:0%
their own schedule they're not a
full-time

00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
they're no longer full-time
 
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.430 align:start position:0%
they're no longer full-time
employees

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
the other aspect that i think is
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
important for the committee to know so
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
with regard to this bill which is to
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
create a commission
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
there is currently
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
a task force domestic violence task
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
force that began in january is expected
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
to issue a report probably sometime in
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
march or thereabouts
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
and many of the people that are
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
participating in that in that domestic
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
violence task force are similar to the
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
types of people that would be in this
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
commission that's being proposed and
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
i've not seen representative gay's
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
amendment so i don't know exactly what
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
was proposed there
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
but within the domestic violence task
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
force we have county attorneys we have
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
legal assistants we have victim witness
 
00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:46.710 align:start position:0%
legal assistants we have victim witness
advocates

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
advocates
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
we have chiefs of police we have the
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
coalition we have dove casa
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh private attorneys
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
so it is a
 
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
a wide spectrum of people that are
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
currently participating in a in a task
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
force that ultimately is likely to lead
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
to legislative recommendations
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
so it may make sense to look at those
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations see what comes out of
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
that and really tailor what it is that
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
you're talking about in this bill
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
into into a more substantive bill that
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
can that can incorporate those task
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
force recommendations and also the
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
testimony that you'll hear here today
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
and and from other people that you may
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
be hearing from but it just may be
 
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.590 align:start position:0%
be hearing from but it just may be
premature

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
premature
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
given that there is this task force
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
given that they will be issuing a report
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
and given
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
that it is likely
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
to include legislative recommendations
 
00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.870 align:start position:0%
to include legislative recommendations
um

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
and now i'll say simply that you know
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
there are this is a very difficult area
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
of the law in and in the vast majority
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
of cases roughly 75 of the cases that
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
are in the family division they are
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
completed within one year of filing not
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
all cases are there are some highly
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
contested cases and you're going to hear
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
this afternoon from judge lemire
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
who does who is one of the few judges
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
that does mostly family family division
 
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.829 align:start position:0%
that does mostly family family division
cases

00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
but they are they are significant and
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
um in some instances highly contested
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
and and judges are simply in the context
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
of the cases that are being presented
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
trying to take the evidence and and
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
render decisions and what we're talking
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%

head
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
so with respect to the task force um
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
if you look uh on page uh actually it's
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
the first page starting at line 28
 
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.629 align:start position:0%
the first page starting at line 28
um

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
i mean it looks like they're
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're looking at domestic abuse so
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
some of these would be picked up with
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
that i would suspect correct
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
i think that's i think that's correct
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
that's right okay and with respect to
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
other uh
 
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.030 align:start position:0%
other uh
uh

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
educating court staff uh
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
trauma suffered by victims um
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
children permitting to speak for
 
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.949 align:start position:0%
children permitting to speak for
themselves

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
do you think any of that within the task
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
force will be addressed
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
truthfully i i'm not sure some of it
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
certainly training uh is is on their
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
agenda um uh
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
and again i'll i'll note that it is a
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
domestic violence task force right so it
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover the full range of
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
matters that are being heard in the
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
family division um but i think in terms
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
of that type of recommendation i i do
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
believe that is one of the specific
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
items that they have on their list of
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
things to look at one more follow-up if
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
i may madam chair certainly uh
 
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.070 align:start position:0%
i may madam chair certainly uh
who

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
who picked this task force uh the chief
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
justice the chief of justice i think
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
that i think that's picked any i think
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
he consulted with some folks but it it
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
was created by the the chief justice
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay great and i should have added
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
the task force has a public hearing
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
scheduled for the 21st
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%

my name is katrina heinrich my case has
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
been in the control of the family court
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
for over a decade
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill i'd like to
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
speak to some notable reasons i believe
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
that this needs to happen
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
first let me begin by saying i was
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
delighted that the governor signed
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
the family court awareness month
 
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.470 align:start position:0%
the family court awareness month
proclamation

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
proclamation
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
which embedded in that proclamation was
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
governmental and academia studies that
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
support the reasoning behind it and the
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
need for it
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
the statistics from 2020
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
from the administrative office of the
 
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.590 align:start position:0%
from the administrative office of the
court

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
noted that about 20 percent of the
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
family law cases
 
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.789 align:start position:0%
family law cases
actually

00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
actually are extracted from the overall
 
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.630 align:start position:0%
actually are extracted from the overall
pool

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
pool
 
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.909 align:start position:0%
pool
of

00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the number was at that time 20
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
25 000 cases
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
in those cases when you break it down
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's 3 000 cases and in that 3 000
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
cases that's actually affecting at least
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
a minimum of two
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire because
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
there's two people in every case that
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't even include what children there
 
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.430 align:start position:0%
doesn't even include what children there
is

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
so a number of people are being
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know affected by this
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
so with that said i'm going to go on
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
with some of the issues that i have
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
found that are very transparent you can
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
see them you have to look at the data
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
and the only way to do that is to
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
investigate it
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
the lack of transparency issues at the
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
family court
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
for me one of the biggest ones is the
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
gals are paid private contractors
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
in that particular case i feel like they
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
should not get immunity they do not work
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
directly for the government they work
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
for themselves they have no direct boss
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
of responsibility they themselves are
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
the boss
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
the control of that
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
goes without speaking
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
they work directly with children and
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
family without obligation or
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
accountability this includes their
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
business practices actions and decisions
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
non-medical professionals are paid
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
privately also in most cases
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
void of accountability the court
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
is ordering medical and psychological
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
services and treatment to families and
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
children where it's not needed
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
there is no litmus test for them
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
the court is making judgments and orders
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
rendering opinions and decisions about
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who may or may not be party
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
to the case without service
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
and a very good example of that is
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
they're including
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
people that have never been served
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
they've never been given court decisions
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
but they're in the orders restricting
 
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.110 align:start position:0%
but they're in the orders restricting
them

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
children do not have the voice as in my
 
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.430 align:start position:0%
children do not have the voice as in my
case

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
my daughter has already stated
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
in numerous letters to
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
numerous legislators
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
how her kidnapping occurred
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
and that had the gao actually been
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
working for the child it would have
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
never happened
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
the result of that is her lifelong ptsd
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
which is the reason she is not here
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
today to testify
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
the little girl that is missing harmony
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
really set uh
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
her off for the last week
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
she herself was removed from the state
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
and the state didn't care no matter what
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
i tried to do
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
she couldn't contact me for 45 days she
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
found a way to get a message to me i had
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
no idea where my child was
 
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.390 align:start position:0%
no idea where my child was
none

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
the court fails to acknowledge the abuse
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
and trauma suffered by the victims
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%

by way of written transcripts of family
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%

incomplete and missing critical data
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the court the family

court software and technology is
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
incapable of accurately recording

proceedings in their entirety
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%

time
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
if you uh
 
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.789 align:start position:0%
if you uh
understand

00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
the that the simple summation of the
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
natural rights that our constitution
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
state constitution is designed to
 
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
recognize and protect
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
are that a man's home is his castle
 
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.549 align:start position:0%
are that a man's home is his castle
the

00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
subjects that this committee deals with
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
every one of them every single one of
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
them reaches inside that castle
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore it is incumbent upon you
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
to have a particular regard to those
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:00.789 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
family court
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
this committee was formed the year after
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
the first family court was
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
created and then it was under the
 
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
auspices of this committee
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
that it was eventually expanded
 
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.909 align:start position:0%
that it was eventually expanded
statewide

00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
that courts those courts deal with
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
the subject matter of your committee
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's divorce
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
child protection
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
whatever and it is therefore your duty
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the court is doing its
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
job in dealing justly with your
 
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.190 align:start position:0%
job in dealing justly with your
constituents

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.549 align:start position:0%
constituents
um

00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
one thing i'd like to bring up it was
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
brought up that there are no longer any
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
marital masters as of 2012 they were
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
phased out that is true they were
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
replaced with referees
 
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.990 align:start position:0%
replaced with referees
however

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
while the
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
all have specific recom uh requirements
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
of their referees
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
family court reference referees have no
 
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.750 align:start position:0%
family court reference referees have no
requirements

00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
when i tried to impose requirements it
 
00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.350 align:start position:0%
when i tried to impose requirements it
was

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
pursuant to a tally of the referees and
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
family court at the time was
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 2014 2015 i can't really
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
give you a precise number anymore
 
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.310 align:start position:0%
give you a precise number anymore
um

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
a large number of them
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
were simply listed as former court
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
employees they were not attorneys they
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
were not former judges they were former
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
court employees
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
you can obtain this information through
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
legislative services and i
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
advise you to do so
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
see who is there doing making uh
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the judges
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh this is important
 
00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:42.789 align:start position:0%
uh this is important
because

00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
second party i or second hand
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
i have knowledge of
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
referees or marital master who's then a
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
referee and is now a judge who accepted
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
closed envelopes as
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
information upon which children were
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
removed from custody
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
no one ever saw what was inside of that
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
it was observed by then representative
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
ms heinrich who
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
you just heard observed the same
 
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.269 align:start position:0%
you just heard observed the same
behavior

00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
not everything and there's a lot of good
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
that happens in family court there's a
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
lot that is not good that happens in
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
family court and it's your job
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it ceases the bad
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
if there is anything i find
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
missing now in this legislation i advise
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
you to adopt the proposed amendment
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's a very good idea to have
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
members of the community
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
what is not included is investigating
 
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.950 align:start position:0%
what is not included is investigating
uh

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
what happened you know those cases in
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
which it goes sideways
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
what and find out why certain cases go
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
sideways when there is loss of due
 
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.470 align:start position:0%
sideways when there is loss of due
process

00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
and that's basically every time it goes
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
sideways it's a loss of due process
 
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.110 align:start position:0%
sideways it's a loss of due process
figure

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
figure
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
court rule 1.2 says the court in the
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
interest of justice the judge may waive
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
any rule not in statute
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
which means simply
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
there are no rules
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
except at the discretion of the judge
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
so you need to define determine
 
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:20.870 align:start position:0%
so you need to define determine
which

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
rules or what needs to be put into
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
statute so that it cannot be
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
circumvented i'd be happy to take any
 
00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:27.669 align:start position:0%
circumvented i'd be happy to take any
questions

00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mister it's uh
 
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:30.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mister it's uh
we've

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
one question representative cody
 
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.710 align:start position:0%
one question representative cody
bollinger

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you the
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
honorable daniza for being here today uh
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
if anybody understands the family court
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
at this table probably one of the number
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
one people who do
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
one of
 
00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.230 align:start position:0%
one of
um

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
what was that uh
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
what was that
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
the court rule you just mentioned 1.2
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh it dovetails with the
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
authorization of the family courts i
 
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
think it's uh
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
473 d colon 4 which says notwithstanding
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
in spite of which means in spite of any
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
law to the contrary
 
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:11.990 align:start position:0%
law to the contrary
the

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
family court has equity powers in all of
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
any law that was passed
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
prior to 2012 has no particular force in
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes ma'am certainly thank you
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%

can you provide that to this committee
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
for the follow-up
 
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.669 align:start position:0%

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i don't have the amendment
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
in front of me but if somehow i can get
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%

00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
particularly dissolved what what this
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%

and if we can just listen to that
 
00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:45.190 align:start position:0%
and if we can just listen to that
briefly

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
and i recognize attorney sternberg's
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
writing i believe maybe maybe not but
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
her name
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
the council should know that attorney
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
sternberg and i are
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
very good friends
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
very good friends i don't know if she
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me sir excuse me sir yeah we're
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
very good friends can you speak to the
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
relevance of this
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
yes the need to establish a court record
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
so again
 
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.310 align:start position:0%
so again
um

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
we have serious issues in just these
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
nine cases
 
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.509 align:start position:0%
nine cases
alone

00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
alone
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to ask uh if everyone
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
caught that on the audio because
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
kathleen sternenberg was a little harder
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
but they were both there and she
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
certainly agreed with julie intercostal
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
about the friendship
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the key that's back in
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
okay and marital master bruce staupra
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
also knew about the conflict
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
since then too and we know that because
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
julian tricasso said so in her sworn
 
00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:05.110 align:start position:0%
julian tricasso said so in her sworn
deposition

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
deposition
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
anyway not everyone from all those nine
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
cases is here today but we have a couple
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
you can hear more from them directly
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
and so i just wanted to be crystal clear
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
to everyone what the issue was in those
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
cases it goes far beyond the alteration
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
of court documents and for everyone to
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
pretty much just hear
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh miss intercostal and sternenberg to
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
say it for themselves
 
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.669 align:start position:0%
say it for themselves
so

00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
that's right there is reason enough to
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
support the bill i'll just add i like
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
the amendments
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i agree there's probably
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
plenty of
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
other good reasons as well
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh that's all i have to say on this so
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
i'd like to save the bulk of my time to
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
speak to appeals later thank you does
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for mr
 
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.069 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for mr
albrecht

00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
albrecht
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:58.230 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
sir

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
just a quick question
 
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.430 align:start position:0%
just a quick question
how

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
how do you believe this commission is
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
going to solve all the issues that
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
you're bringing forward
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh so i'm just bringing forward
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully nine cases in which we know
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
there are serious problems
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
that really justifies the need for this
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
commission and i would imagine
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
in its existence that
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
more cases with serious problems other
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
than these nine i think you'll probably
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
hear from vivian later
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
would also be representative
 
00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:35.990 align:start position:0%
would also be representative
of

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
cases that a commission like this just
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
might want to look into and figure out
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up for me certainly i
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't see in the in the bill where uh
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
they're looking at specific cases so
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
that that's where i'm having a hard time
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
tying into how these nine
 
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.069 align:start position:0%
tying into how these nine
issues

00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
are expected to be resolved within
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
with this study committee i'm trying to
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
get that tie-in can you help me with
 
00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.990 align:start position:0%
get that tie-in can you help me with
that

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:04.870 align:start position:0%
that
uh

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
gather if they don't look at any cases
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
what are they doing
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
well they're doing what the bill says
 
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.589 align:start position:0%
well they're doing what the bill says
they

00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
should be looking at
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
i mean they're studying the family court
 
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
system but how do you do that without
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
some representative examples of what
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
it's doing yeah i don't know okay thank
 
00:36:24.839 --> 00:36:26.710 align:start position:0%
it's doing yeah i don't know okay thank

um
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
it says that um on line 28 part 3 the
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
commission shall study parenting cases
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
and decisions by courts
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
within the judicial family branch system
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:06.710 align:start position:0%
is the
and

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
as i understand you're one of these nine
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
correct so
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
is it your
 
00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.430 align:start position:0%
is it your
hope

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
hope
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
that um your
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
case will be used
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
as instructive
 
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.710 align:start position:0%
as instructive
yes

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
all of the nine is instructive and may i
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
follow up please yes and so i'm
 
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.829 align:start position:0%
follow up please yes and so i'm
um

00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
is it um
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm asking is are your
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
your hope if i understand your hope is
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
that these nine will create
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
um a template for exploring further
 
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.589 align:start position:0%
um a template for exploring further
cases

00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
possibly case review is that
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
i i think these are a great example of
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
things that can make a template that
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean there aren't some
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
other different types of cases that
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
can't as well
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay i i
 
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
get it yes now thank you i understand
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
in october of 2018 i went through the
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
family division in nashua where judge
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
intercasso and marital master delta
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
assigned kathleen sternenberg moving
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
forward six months later march 12 2019
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
judge intercostal personally signed off
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
on three specific orders related to the
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
guardian at lightham her payments and
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
how i have to comply with her and in one
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the cover sheets from the court it
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
said my failure to comply with the
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
guardian at lightham would potentially
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.599 --> 00:39:22.710 align:start position:0%
 
two

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
three days later judge introcaso issued
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
a handwritten order in my case in which
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
she said
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
i have to disclose for the record that
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
gl sternberg is my best friend we travel
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
together we discuss finances she is the
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
godmother to my children and this is a
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest that in my opinion
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
cannot be waived at this point i looked
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
at the order and i said it took you six
 
00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.109 align:start position:0%
at the order and i said it took you six
months

00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
to realize this and to disclose this to
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
me this is not fair when you're making
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
substantive motions
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
regarding my life my child and how i pay
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
for the guardian at lightham
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i filed a judicial conduct committee
 
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.990 align:start position:0%
so i filed a judicial conduct committee
complaint

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
while under investigation
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
julian tricasso took my file into her
 
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.589 align:start position:0%
julian tricasso took my file into her
office

00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
and altered several of my documents
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
including whiting out the handwritten
 
00:40:12.319 --> 00:40:14.550 align:start position:0%
including whiting out the handwritten
portion

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
portion
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
where she
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
said i had to pay kathleen sternenberg
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
she went on to blame me for this
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
i didn't do it i would never do anything
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
she blamed the court staff they said we
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
didn't do it we have no interest in
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
so i had to be prepped by the judicial
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
conduct committee and in my opinion they
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
did the attorney waste act did a stellar
 
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.309 align:start position:0%
did the attorney waste act did a stellar
job

00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
however moving forward
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
i went to
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
the court and i filed a motion saying
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
can we remove this gal there's clearly a
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
conflict she's an attorney she had a
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
duty to disclose this conflict with
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
former judge intercosta and it makes you
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
conflict or
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
or question
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
her ability to testify truthfully if
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
she's not even disclosing a known
 
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.870 align:start position:0%
she's not even disclosing a known
conflict

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
despite my request to have her removed
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
as gal
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
my new judge said to me
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
this can be redressed with the supreme
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
court you can file an appeal ma'am can
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
can you stay with the substance of the
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
bill your issues are very valid and
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
relevant to a degree
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
but we really need to hear about okay
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
the bill i apologize so my but my i'm
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
just trying to tie it together and i'm
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
almost done so my judge said to appeal
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
it to the supreme court go to the
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
judiciary or go to the gal board i tried
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
all three gal boards said you cannot
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
file a complaint until your case is
 
00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.670 align:start position:0%
file a complaint until your case is
concluded

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
concluded
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
i can't appeal to the supreme court
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
until it's done the judiciary said
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
go to your judge and ask
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
i have no recourse at this point so
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
to tie it all together i think if there
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
was a committee to
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
investigate this it would give litigants
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
who are in my situation an opportunity
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
to be hurt i feel like my hands are tied
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
at this point and every state agency
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
that could be helping is
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
there's a loophole and nobody can help
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
at this point that's concludes my
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
testimony if anybody has any questions
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
any questions for this
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
next i'll call on laura
 
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.550 align:start position:0%
next i'll call on laura

my daughter and son are from separate
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
relationships as such they have separate
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
court cases both of which i'm labeled
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
the respondent both of which were heard
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
nashua new hampshire court system
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
and approximately 2019 with jl and
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
sternenberg initiating both of those
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
since then it's just gone off of that
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
determination by j.l sternberg and um
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
former george anacosta
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
my the exhibits that you have in front
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
of you are labeled chronologically um
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
this is especially important given the
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
fact that um in in particular note there
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
was an instance in which julian acosta
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
wrote an ex parte email directly to my
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
attorney at that point in time
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh saying she was going to appoint
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
kathleen sternenberg at g as a jail
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
in the case unless she unless my
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
attorney objected within the next 27
 
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.910 align:start position:0%
attorney objected within the next 27
minutes

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
i've been going through this process
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
since 2005 every three years
 
00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.030 align:start position:0%
since 2005 every three years
2019

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
was the initiation that
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
both my exes
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
had started and
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
essentially that was the point in time i
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
lost both my children they were taken
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
away from me citing the fact that i
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
my gps wasn't working and i couldn't
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
make it to the softball field my
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
daughter's softball game was at and they
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
felt that that was an extreme case of
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
mental disorder and that was rationale
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
behind taking my kids away
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
i haven't had normal parenting time with
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
my children since 2019 prior to that i
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
was a primary caregiver for both my
 
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
parents for both my children with
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
limited involvement from their
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
respective fathers
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is an extreme upheaval and it goes

parenting
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
i started out as a full-time mom for
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
almost 12 years and i offered and
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
proposed a schedule close to 50 50 and
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
now i've become an every other weekend
 
00:46:31.359 --> 00:46:32.390 align:start position:0%
now i've become an every other weekend
mom

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
mom
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
for the majority of the year
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
my entire life changed when kathleen
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
sternberg took my daughter away for no
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
good reason in a 20-minute review
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
hearing before marital master thomas
 
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.470 align:start position:0%
hearing before marital master thomas
cooper

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
cooper
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
on november 30th 2020 it's hard to
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
believe a gal can make such an influence
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
on a marital math and a marital master
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
did decide without any proof of neglect
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
or abuse
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
never did i think november 30th 2021
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
would result in the young in the outcome
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
it did unfortunately it happened to be
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
it happened to me in a blink
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
i am still struggling to figure out why
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
and how kathleen sternberg
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
made her recommendation on hearsay and
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
false allegations before my scheduled
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
final hearing january 28 2021
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
i brought the transcript for you that
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
for that it's only 15 pages
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's all it took to lose the most
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
precious thing in my life 20 minutes
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
this recommendation from the gal did
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
destroy the close and fun-loving
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
relationship between my daughter and me
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
one would think the court exercising its
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
equitable powers would exercise fairness
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
and good conscience ought to be
 
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.270 align:start position:0%
and good conscience ought to be
administered

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
administered
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
all relief
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
with the nature of the case and the
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
facts demand
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
please understand what the courts did in
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
my case
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not just a case number
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
only having one child
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
in the judiciary system took that honor
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
well this is is extremely difficult to
 
00:48:23.839 --> 00:48:25.990 align:start position:0%
well this is is extremely difficult to
comprehend

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
comprehend
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
inequal to change the child's residence
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
in a school
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
on a temporary basis
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
i feel the findings of fact and ruling
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
of law should avoid significance in
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
determining the relocation of my
 
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.069 align:start position:0%
determining the relocation of my
daughter

00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
and this is exactly why i support hb
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
1346 and i hope you will consider it too
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
we need to study the family court system
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
and figure out why this is happening to
 
00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.109 align:start position:0%
and figure out why this is happening to
families

00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%

i left when she was a year old i always
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
tried i think both parents deserve to be
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
involved in the child's life
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
he had every thursday friday
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
and every other weekend
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
when she became five he took me to court
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
again for full custody
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
um we went to mediation that time
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
no gal worked out okay
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know he then became in every other
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
and every other week in the summer
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
school vacations
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
anything that wouldn't disrupt
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
her schooling here in concord
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
he lives in dover
 
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.069 align:start position:0%
he lives in dover
um

00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
now it's completely flipped i offered
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
throughout the course
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
of this last previous time of november
 
00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.270 align:start position:0%
of this last previous time of november
2019

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
every weekend school vacations every
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
other week in the summer my daughter
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
wanted more time with her father
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely she craved it
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
i never wanted to deprive her of that
 
00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.589 align:start position:0%
i never wanted to deprive her of that
um

00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
but yet when you have somebody that
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
almost has his
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
and not to say but it feels like
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
his hatred for me for leaving him
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
um was almost stronger than the love of
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
his child
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
what father really wants
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
to do this to a mother
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's obviously to hurt her
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
and he manipulated the gal
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
and we'll hear more i have a few bills
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to testify on today
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
but um i really felt
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
when a parent is
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do the best of their child and
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
the other one's just
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
bashing the other one
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
where and there's no evidence it's just
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
boggling to me how
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
i could end up like this and what scary
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
is i'm very well known
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
within the community
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
i'm a realtor i've owned a hair salon
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
business for 22 years
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
and everybody knows what type of mom i
 
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.829 align:start position:0%
and everybody knows what type of mom i
am

00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
am
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
they're scared to think
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
to see what i've gone through
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
they are scared they're like how does
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
this happen
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
we we can't even imagine
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
you are such a wonderful mom you and
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
still have always been like this but
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a child can be bride a
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
child can be made promises
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
a child wants to love both parents
 
00:51:46.559 --> 00:51:47.910 align:start position:0%
a child wants to love both parents
period

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
and a gal in the middle of it no kid
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
deserves to be in the middle
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
and a gal does that in favor is it
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps the parent that's paying her
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
is it um
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
i had
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
allegations made against me when he
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't getting his way
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
and then a gal was ordered thomas
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
marital master thomas cooper
 
00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.829 align:start position:0%
marital master thomas cooper
um

00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
refused to give him an in-camera
 
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.270 align:start position:0%
refused to give him an in-camera
interview

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
interview
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
early into
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
the proceedings of him filing again for
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
so things were going right i can't say
 
00:52:27.359 --> 00:52:28.390 align:start position:0%
so things were going right i can't say
thomas

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
thomas
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
cooper is to blame for everything but i
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
think gals hold too much power and it
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
needs to be overlooked more
 
00:52:36.079 --> 00:52:37.190 align:start position:0%
needs to be overlooked more
um

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
because if you were to read
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
the temporary order and her
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations and the things that are
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
said about me
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
are horrifying it's embarrassing
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
so embarrassing
 
00:52:50.079 --> 00:52:52.870 align:start position:0%
so embarrassing
um

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
and i guess i i hope i answered your
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
question i know i probably went off a
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
little no you did but i i i think i was
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
fair i think i um
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
i always try and look at things from all
 
00:53:03.119 --> 00:53:04.549 align:start position:0%
i always try and look at things from all
perspectives

00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
perspectives
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
um tuesday was very hard for me i i
 
00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.230 align:start position:0%
um tuesday was very hard for me i i
actually

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
i'm very emotional about this this like
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
tuesday reminded me of being in court a
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
mic people staring at you being judged
 
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.390 align:start position:0%
mic people staring at you being judged
so

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'm here today
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
to hopefully say
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
to my daughter and
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
future families that voices can be heard
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
things can be changed
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
but you can't stay silent and i think we
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
kind of stand in numbers today and i
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
really appreciate you guys hearing us
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
i just want to make an announcement for
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
the safety of the committee
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
i would ask all audience members or
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
people who are testifying to not
 
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.069 align:start position:0%
people who are testifying to not
approach

00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
the committee members if you have
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
something you would like us to
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
enter into the record please do
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
leave it at the first
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
of each end of the table
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
especially those who are
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.559 --> 00:54:09.670 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
safer for our committee members for you
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
to not approach
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate that thank you very much
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
and the next person i'd like to call is
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%

children and family
committee

00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
um i actually won't even need three
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
minutes but i did that just in case
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
my name is vivian gerard i'm the mother
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
of two daughters age 13 and 15.
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
many of you heard my testimony on
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
tuesday last week about my struggles
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
getting child support
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
i had 20 trial court hearings
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
mostly by julian dicasso and
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
more recently master bruce delpra
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
i had four appeals
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire supreme court
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
the rulings came from them they were all
 
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.670 align:start position:0%
the rulings came from them they were all
okay

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
and it's been seven
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
it's been a seven year sentence from
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
hell for me
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
clearly something is very very wrong
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
here so maybe just maybe
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
we should figure this out
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
what it really is
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
and that's why i support this bill
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%

thank you very much
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is alicia brochu
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
i uh i'm not very good at public
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
speaking i apologize
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
i'm here today as a mother stepmother
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
and a formal former legal professional
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
and i support this bill
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
um our family courts do have an
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
unbelievable amount of discretion
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
the only guidance that they really have
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
when determining children's lives is in
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
their best interest that guidance is
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
vague our judges are only human though
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
they have all sworn an oath to complete
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
their duties in accordance with the law
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
and without bias because they are only
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
human that bias will affect their
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
decision they can't help it
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes they get it right but other
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
times they get it wrong
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
and when they get it wrong it can have a
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
devastating effect on the children
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
not just physically and mentally but
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
also mentally and emotionally
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
we need this committee to give the
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
legislature the information and the data
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
they need to determine where more
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
guidance to the judiciary is needed
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
we've all heard um the statistics
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
regarding the benefits of equal shared
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
parenting it needs to be known how often
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
our judiciary follows the science and
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
ensures that when parents are both
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
willing fit and able
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
that our children are able to maintain
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
an equal relationship with both
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
we all know the devastating effects that
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
domestic violence has on children as the
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
gentleman in the smashing thai said
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
there is a death task force regarding it
 
00:57:18.069 --> 00:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
but what is not talked about is the
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
effects of false allegations of abuse
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
and how that has on children
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
i personally have been a victim of
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
domestic violence in my past
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
relationships and my family has been the
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
victims of false allegation and that
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
pain is very real that trauma is very
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
real for children
 
00:57:37.359 --> 00:57:41.270 align:start position:0%
real for children
um

00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
we need we also need to know um if the
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
guardian idol items are
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
performing their duties ethically
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
um and without the loyalty binds that
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
where the payment comes from can create
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
without all of this data every attempt
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
of the legislature to issue more direct
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
guidance to the judiciary will be like
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
trying to stop a flood without knowing
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
where the water is coming from
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
the only ones who will truly suffer are
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
not the parties listed
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the case name
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
but it's the children whose lives these
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
orders directly affect
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
i believe in the need for the study so
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
much that when my husband said to me
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
we need to do something
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a study into these
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
courts there's been too much going on
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
there and i said
 
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:29.990 align:start position:0%
there and i said
okay

00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
he said let's sue the state i was like
 
00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.150 align:start position:0%
he said let's sue the state i was like
okay

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh he couldn't find an attorney to take
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
it so i said you know what let's throw
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
the spaghetti on the wall let's try it
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
so we petitioned this uh superior court
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
in rockingham county to ish to issue a
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
manamis relief for
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
studying the family courts of course
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
superior court doesn't have the
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
authority to issue mandemous relief and
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
create a study so now i am here
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
looking at you all to do the right thing
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
we really need this data
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
the only people that are truly a hundred
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
percent affected by these judicial
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
orders are children and it's lifelong
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
and now we have generations of children
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
that are now adults being traumatized by
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
when judges get it wrong thank you
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
we do have one more person who wishes to
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
testify eric braund
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
eric you've asked for three minutes
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
can we make it even more brief
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
i will thank you madam chair i will do
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
my best thank you kindly
 
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and committee
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
members for listening to me today there
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
are obviously a number of bills um
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
affecting family courts that are on the
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
docket today i only plan on speaking on
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
a few of them um most of my remarks and
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
many others here uh will probably be
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
very duplicate in nature
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
um i am
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
life pretty much a lifelong citizen of
 
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
nashua business owner for 30 plus years
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
father of three
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
um i do support hb 1346.
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
um this committee is seeing an onslaught
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
of bills between this week and last week
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
that all have to do with the family
 
01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.270 align:start position:0%
that all have to do with the family
court

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is really all coming in light of
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
the three court officials that were
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
removed from nashua
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
i believe and many others believe that
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
there are many others that have been
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
affected by not just these judges and
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
court officials but by many others
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state there have
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
been many before myself and the group of
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
people behind me that have tried to make
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
some change within the state within the
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
court systems that have kind of given up
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's a very very hard uphill icy battle
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
in order to try to make change within
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
the state on a lot of these things
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
currently the judges and and masters if
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
court officials can throw out evidence
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
not listen to evidence
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
use their own opinion as fact
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
completely erase one parent
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
completely disable financially another
 
01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.990 align:start position:0%
completely disable financially another
parent

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
as you're listening to the testimony
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
over the last week and
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
what you're going to hear today it
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
should be very clear that there needs to
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
be a look into what's going on in these
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's more than 50 percent of the
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
population that is affected by divorce
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
with so many people that have been
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
affected by this there's been very very
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
few changes over the years that have
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
gone to if to
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
help out
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
representative long asked how this bill
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
would help before
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned there are so many people
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
that have tried to make change before
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
that haven't gotten the ears of the
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
committees and of the rest of the
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
legislature in the senate
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
we're just the tip of the iceberg here
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make a change and we really
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
truly hope that everyone in this room is
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
listening and that we've gotten your
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
attention and we can make some change
 
01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.109 align:start position:0%
attention and we can make some change
together

01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's not just the
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
guardian items that we hear a lot about
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
but it's really the whole entire process
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's erasing parents
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
i've had my children removed from me
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
from my from my life to become just in
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
every other parent when i was probably
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
one of the most involved dads that you
 
01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
can imagine not just in the community
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
but in the upbringing of my children
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
from feeding and changing diapers to
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
teaching them things to coaching for
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
them and doing all of this and to
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
practically erase me financially and as
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
a parent
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like it's the right thing
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
i think that this review
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
will help find the flaws and make the
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
correct changes that are necessary
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
as you can see with a lot of the bills
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
that are coming out in last week and
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
this week
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
there needs to be that change our
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
children don't deserve just to be with
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
the best parent as some of the guardian
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
items try to choose they deserve to be
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
with both parents and this is just part
 
01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:11.990 align:start position:0%
with both parents and this is just part
of

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
complexity to what's going on within the
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
family courts you also need to look at
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
the financial aspect of it as well so
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's a whole court system that needs to
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
be done i'll be happy to take any
 
01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:27.430 align:start position:0%
be done i'll be happy to take any
questions

01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:28.839 align:start position:0%
do we have any
 
01:03:28.839 --> 01:03:30.390 align:start position:0%
do we have any
questions

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you

and with that i'll close the hearing
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%

wait a minute
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
that one was for the other one
 
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.829 align:start position:0%
that one was for the other one
yeah

01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh i apologize that was a clerk too
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay 1436. here you go
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
representative gig
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
what is the appropriate way to address
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
you all
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
i should know by now
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
just thank you for hearing my my
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
presentation for house bill 1436
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
to establish the right to a de novo
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
which means from the beginning
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
i don't have latin but they said that
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
means starting over appeal to the
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
superior court for family court
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
divisions because right now
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
you have to appeal to the supreme court
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
and some of the inconveniences of that
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
are number one supreme court's extremely
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
busy and there's only one of them and
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
the other is that they require they just
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
review what has happened so if you were
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
not able to present a
 
01:05:09.119 --> 01:05:10.630 align:start position:0%
not able to present a
testimony

01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know what i ate
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
if you're able uh if you are only able
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
to or you were not permitted to present
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
evidence and
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
testimony it's still not going to be in
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
the record or reviewed
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
so if you start over
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
with a
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
superior court you can be have your case
 
01:05:32.079 --> 01:05:33.589 align:start position:0%
superior court you can be have your case
reheard

01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
reheard
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
and it it's true there is a risk in
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
there because they said over 90 of the
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
cases are
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
pro se
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
so i mean you're stepping into something
 
01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.430 align:start position:0%
so i mean you're stepping into something
that

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know a good attorney could just work
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
right around you but hopefully the the
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
truth will out so that's the conclusion
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
of my testimony if anybody wants to ask
 
01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.910 align:start position:0%
of my testimony if anybody wants to ask
questions

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.510 align:start position:0%
questions
please

01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
next i'll call
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch um just in terms of
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
background the superior court would be
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
where this these cases would be appealed
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
currently there are
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
approximately 21 superior court judges
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
they hear about 17 000 plus cases a year
 
01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.150 align:start position:0%
they hear about 17 000 plus cases a year
currently

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
in if we were to
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
incorporate family division into the
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
superior court on de novo
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
trial so essentially starting over again
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
going to make the party start over again
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
the courts are going to start over again
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
the evidence is going to start over
 
01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.829 align:start position:0%
the evidence is going to start over
again

01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
you were talking about a significant
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
increase in caseload in the superior
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
court where they don't currently do
 
01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.069 align:start position:0%
court where they don't currently do
family

01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
family cases so if you currently in
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
family division and again family court
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist anymore we're talking
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
family division of the circuit court
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
there are roughly 25 000 new or reopened
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
cases there that would all be eligible
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
for appeal on a on a
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
a brand new case essentially in superior
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
court um the
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
increase in load the increase in
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
um in in complexity of of managing the
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
is going to is going to increase
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
exponentially if these cases were all
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
appealed or or some significant
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
percentage of them are appealed on a de
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
novo basis to the superior court i can't
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
say how many are going to appeal be
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
appealed but there is it's an inevitable
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
significant increase in in case load
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
where they're simply not currently set
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
up to do that i don't know that that's
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of this bill it doesn't
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
talk about what type of decisions can be
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
appealed it just says aggrieved by the
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
decision in the course of any particular
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
case that's pending there are numerous
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
decisions that are being made along the
 
01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.510 align:start position:0%
decisions that are being made along the
way

01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
and it's it's just unclear from the bill
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not we're talking every
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
decision that is being made at the
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
family division is appealable to the
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
superior court to be heard over again
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to you're going to
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
cause a significant load in the superior
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
court you're also going to potentially
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
create significant additional costs for
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
the parties
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
especially you have the non-appealing
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
party who is now going to have to try
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
that entire case over again
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
there are just
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
significant complexities that i think
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
obvious from a fairly simple bill that
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
simply says
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
you can have de novo appeals to the
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
i think what what that would entail is
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
significant and not currently manageable
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
in the system we have today i'd be happy
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions with that
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know who raised their hand first
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
so we'll
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you madam
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
chairs uh so mr head
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
when we set up the family division
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
that was to expedite out of superior
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
court correct that was that
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
expedite these cases no family division
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
was was established as as part of the
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
creation of the circuit court so there
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
was a consolidation of family court um
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
district court and probate court all of
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
which operated separately and brought
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
them under the the new circuit court a
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
lot of it was a
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh budgetary issue so
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
a significant reduction in staff flowed
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
from that
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
and just some some other uh
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh efficiencies but no it was not a
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
it was not a superior court operation it
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
was it was a family court operation
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
prior to that
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
right uh follow up by me
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
certainly the um so so there was no
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
there was no expedition with respect to
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh this family division being the
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
circuit court being set up
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
it was financial
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding i wasn't involved in
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
2011 but i think a lot of it was uh
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
was both efficiency and financial
 
01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.149 align:start position:0%
was both efficiency and financial
okay

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding okay thank you
 
01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.390 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding okay thank you
and

01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
the next person
 
01:10:41.679 --> 01:10:42.830 align:start position:0%
the next person
representative

01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
belanger thank you madam chair and i'm
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
going to preface this because
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i will get to my question just
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
there is a preface to that
 
01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.830 align:start position:0%
there is a preface to that
so

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
i've been to family court myself twice
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
now for two different cases one to adopt
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
my nephew and one to obtain
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me one to obtain custody of my
 
01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.229 align:start position:0%
excuse me one to obtain custody of my
niece

01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
niece
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
the second case
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
we have a judge who
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
tends to think he has a lot of power in
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
that courtroom and in fact mentioned to
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
me directly
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
that it's his courtroom and his rules
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
for many families that are dealing with
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
the same issue in the same judicial
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
discretion that is slightly
 
01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.310 align:start position:0%
discretion that is slightly
more

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
inappropriate if you will
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
what is the current appeals process for
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
families like myself and some of the
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
families that are dealing with that
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's a couple aspects i think thank
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
you for the question there's a couple
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
aspects one is
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
appeals on the decisions being made to
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
there are if the if the judge is acting
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
in a way that is unethical there's the
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee which would
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
enforce as you heard earlier specific
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
some of those could apply to the
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
circumstance that you're talking about i
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't know the specifics
 
01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.669 align:start position:0%
don't know the specifics
um

01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:13.679 --> 01:12:14.709 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh there can also some people would
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
at least flag any issues for the
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the circuit
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
court judge king
 
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.149 align:start position:0%
court judge king
but

01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
in general what you're talking about are
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
appeals to the supreme court on
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
decisions appeals to or
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
complaints filed with the judicial
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
conduct committee on ethical violations
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
and on the basic administration of the
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
courts uh judge king
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes man i'm sure thank you thank you for
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
answering my question so basically what
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
you're saying is there's already an
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
appeals process
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
if i can clarify there's already an
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
appeals process to the supreme court
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
follow

01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
so this bill is saying that
 
01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.990 align:start position:0%
so this bill is saying that
um

01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
you can appeal to the
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
correct no this bill says this bill
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
would say that any party aggrieved by a
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
decision of the family court shall have
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
the right to a de novo appeal in the
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
and and actually one other defect in the
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
in the just the way that bill is phrased
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
it says has a de novo appeal in the
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
superior court in the county in which
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
the aggrieved party resides not all the
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
parties necessarily reside in new
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire so it would be unclear at
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
least as the bill was written as to
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
final follow-up yes
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
for those of us who don't know what a
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
novo appeals is can you kind of i want
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
to say for a lack of better terms done
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
that down but uh it's a start over so um
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
so nothing nothing in the original
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
decision would apply to the spirit court
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
in that case you essentially start
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
over again so it'd be as if nothing had
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
happened you file a new petition in this
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
case it would be an appeal
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
in superior court
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
unclear sort of the way the the bill is
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
written as to whether or not you would
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
start discovery over again
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
but typically when you're in superior
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
court you have a period of discovery um
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
and you have motions that are filed and
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
you have a trial if the trial is
 
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
warranted or if it's not resolved in the
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
in the pleadings so you know again it's
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's a starting game start from
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
scratch proceeding
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
no further questions and things
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative grossman did you have
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative all chiller did
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for the
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
explanation and i'm i'm curious mr head
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
um what does the appeals docket look
 
01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.430 align:start position:0%
um what does the appeals docket look
like

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
it seems that what we're hearing
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
is that the process is either
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
so backed up maybe or
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
arduous to access
 
01:15:07.199 --> 01:15:08.790 align:start position:0%
arduous to access
that

01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
that we have this bill sitting in front
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
of us so what is what does the
 
01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.750 align:start position:0%
of us so what is what does the
administrative

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
judge's appeals docket look like
 
01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:18.790 align:start position:0%
judge's appeals docket look like
the

01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.590 align:start position:0%
the
uh

01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
the the family division appeals you mean
 
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that's we're talking about yeah um
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
so currently in the supreme court from
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
the family division
 
01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.709 align:start position:0%
the family division
um

01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
in taking sort of 2019 through 2021
 
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
there were between 184 to 193 cases that
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
were appealed to the supreme court
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
each year so 20 1993 2020 184 and 2021
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'm 186
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's roughly 25 to 30 percent of the
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
supreme court's
 
01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.270 align:start position:0%
supreme court's
caseload

01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
caseload
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
and then within family division of
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
course you have
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
a host of types of cases that are that
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
are within the jurisdiction of the
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
family division so that includes abuse
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
and neglect adoption chins
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
divorce domestic violence
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
family sort of general guardianships of
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
minors juvenile delinquency paternity
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
and termination of parental rights
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
all of those under this bill would in
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
theory be appealable to the superior
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
court for for a start over trial i'm
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
sorry could i get a clarification on
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
what you just said follow up yeah follow
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
up um
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
did you
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong please but there
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
was a lot of numbers right
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
no worries um
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
did you just say that between
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
there are there are between
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
184 to 193 appeals
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
from the family division
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
pending did i catch that correctly every
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
year on so those are annual files so um
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
there are no
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
so taking uh 2020
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh 2020 for example there were 184
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
appeals filed in the supreme court from
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
a family division decision
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
of those
 
01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:08.790 align:start position:0%
of those
well

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
so like the determination parental
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
rights were 68 of those 15 of those were
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
31 of those involve divorce degrees
 
01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:18.709 align:start position:0%
31 of those involve divorce degrees
um

01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
so on et cetera okay let me
 
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
gather a further clarification
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um and
 
01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
of that number that you just gave us of
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
that that range 184. yep um
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
25 are you telling us that 25 to 30
 
01:17:35.679 --> 01:17:37.030 align:start position:0%
25 are you telling us that 25 to 30
percent

01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
of the supreme court's total caseload
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
is reviewing
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
these appeals is that did i understand
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
that correctly
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
yes i think so so approximately 25 to 30
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
percent of the
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
total number of appeals filed
 
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.350 align:start position:0%
total number of appeals filed
um

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
approximately 25 to 30 are appeals from
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
the family division from the family
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
division alone correct okay which which
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
then has within that division a wide
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
range of types of cases
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much i think i get
 
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.669 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much i think i get
it

01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.709 align:start position:0%
any further questions
actually

01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
may i
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
inquire the the numbers that you have is
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
that submitted to us and i just haven't
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
seen that um it was actually submitted
 
01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.110 align:start position:0%
seen that um it was actually submitted
so

01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
oh is that in the email
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
no so
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
on i think the 11th judge king judge
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
ashley and judge lemire all came and
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
presented to this to this um committee
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
and this was part of judge king's
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and he he submitted some
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
written documents when when he testified
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
i think on the 11th of january yep i
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
might have that wrong but um so this is
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
this is from judge king's testimony
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
um when you when the when
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
on the introduction session for this
 
01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.590 align:start position:0%
on the introduction session for this
committee

01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay to also be applied here
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you got it thank you
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
sure representative long thank you
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
um are there any cases that are denied
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry cases of the supreme court do
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
they deny any of them and would you know
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
what to do so
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
fair question so um appeals from uh
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
superior court and circuit court are
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
mandatory appeals in the supreme court
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
so they're they're not subject to
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
discretion as to whether they accept
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
them okay if you're asking so if you're
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
asking whether they accept them they
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
accept all of those
 
01:19:24.239 --> 01:19:26.310 align:start position:0%
accept all of those
the

01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
there's some technical variations that i
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
won't need to get into
 
01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the decision on the merits
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many are no but as far
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
as the what's what's the appeals that
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
are being the numbers you gave us they
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
can't just deny
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not rejecting their
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
appeals they're not able to reject the
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
bill absolute technical defects or
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know if they're not yet a final
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
decision on the merits
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
in between stuff too thank you
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr head thank you
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you again miss heinrich and if you
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
have written testimony and can
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
submit that we'd appreciate it yes
 
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.189 align:start position:0%

absolutely

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm katrina heinrich i'm not going to
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
need the full three minutes
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
due to some information already come out
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
there's no point in
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
doubling down on that
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
for my experience and the cases that
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
i've observed or participated in
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
the access to appeals
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
filing fees tools resources to the
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
family court causing undue burden
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
occurs in the 20 percent of the family
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
cases that i'm speaking about
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
access to law and legal protection seems
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
almost void
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
in my case in particular
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
like most other cases the numerous
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
barriers to access a fair review with a
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
higher court
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
or functional deterrence do exist one of
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
the biggest ones of course being
 
01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:14.229 align:start position:0%
the biggest ones of course being
financial

01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
all attempts at trying to
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
follow the processes that were in place
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh have been caught in loopholes
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
and they continued
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
to determine i mean that was effectively
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
what they did
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
so there was no
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity in any way to get a review
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have to say
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
the next person to testify will be
 
01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.629 align:start position:0%
the next person to testify will be
alicia

01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%

01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
and you've asked for three minutes
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
my name is alicia broshu uh once again
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm in support of this bill and once
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
again i'm testifying as a former legal
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
professional a mother and a stepmother
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
um as it states in the methodology of
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
this bill the supreme court appeals to a
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
matter of um
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
basically they're a matter of law not a
 
01:22:16.719 --> 01:22:17.669 align:start position:0%
basically they're a matter of law not a
fact

01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
so what doesn't state in the methodology
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
is that except for the first final order
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
out of a family law case
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
the supreme court appeals are
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
discretionary they're not mandatory
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
so what that means is that if a person
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
files an appeal with the supreme court
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
unless it is the first final order the
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court can use their discretion
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
to not hear the case
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
and then because of supreme court rules
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
discretionary appeals when they kick it
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
out they don't even have to give you a
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
reason why they're rejecting it so that
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
means that this leaves the majority of
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
the parties with a family law order with
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
no recourse
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
if the orders are in violation of the
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
law or if the violation
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
if the violation is of facts
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
which caused the violation of the law
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
family cases canyon usually do have
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
several final orders especially when the
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
parties per statute have the right to
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate child support every three
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
years or if there's a substantial change
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
in circumstances my husband has appealed
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court three times with
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
two cases all three times the supreme
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
court justices decided it was
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
discretionary so they were not going to
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
hear them two of those cases were in
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
front of the supreme court at the same
 
01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:36.310 align:start position:0%
front of the supreme court at the same
time

01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
both were for child support in the first
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
case the issue is whether or not the
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
child support order was legal due to the
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
fact that the judiciary nine years
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
earlier effectively terminated his
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
rights and issued a lifelong no-contact
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
order but then nine years later same
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
court same judge decided to issue child
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
support even though there's a statute in
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
place that specifically states that any
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
order that permanently severs the
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
parent-child relationship also severs
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities to
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
financially support the child that's the
 
01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.910 align:start position:0%
financially support the child that's the
tpo

01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
tpo
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights statute
 
01:24:12.719 --> 01:24:14.149 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights statute
um

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
the other case is in a different court
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
with a different judge my husband in
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
that case has 80 residential
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility with the mother having 20
 
01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
percent but yet the judge decided that
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
her monthly child support obligation was
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
zero dollars a month
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
the factual reason was because she
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
determined that the parents have
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
approximately equal shared parenting
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
not only as we know equal shared
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
parenting is not a reason permissible by
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
statute to deviate from the child
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
support guidelines but last i checked 80
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
and 20 is not even remotely equal
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
by allowing family court rulings to be
 
01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
appealed to the superior court it will
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
allow parties that are aggrieved by the
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
family courts to have that right to
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
review the way the system currently
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
functions there is absolutely no
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
recourse when a case is opened again
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
once a family law judge makes a ruling
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
whether it is right wrong it is done if
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
they made a mistake there is nowhere to
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
turn to fix it the family court judges
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
are aware of this and last i checked
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's not the definition of justice
 
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
that is actually tyranny thank you
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you madam
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
chair so
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i've been here in an hour of all
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
the court systems are not
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
doing their due diligence yeah so why
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
would going to another
 
01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.430 align:start position:0%
would going to another
court

01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
mostly um
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
a little back story for the past i don't
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
know five years
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
we've been basically trying to for build
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh documentation
 
01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.830 align:start position:0%
uh documentation
and

01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard because
 
01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
going to another court it just gets that
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
eyes in place and right now for instance
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
the the case where my husband's rights
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
were terminated
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
um and then now he has to pay child
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
support 10 years later um the judicial
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
referee in that case actually
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
threatened to default him if he didn't
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
create a crime
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
um if he didn't illegally access my
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
personal banking information even though
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
we are uh married we keep everything
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
separate so he has no access to my bank
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
account information she point blank said
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
if you do not tell me your wife's income
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
and her bank account information i am
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to um i'm going to default you
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
we filed a complaint with the judicial
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
conduct committee and that went nowhere
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
i we filed we
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
went to the attorney general's office
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
they said they didn't have jurisdiction
 
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
i even contacted we filed a federal
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that went nowhere because of
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
judicial immunity um we even contacted
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
the fbi to say hey
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
you know maybe you guys can do something
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
i i think it's the it's the desperation
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
that people need right now because not
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
only are the these judges and court
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
actors they're not upholding your
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
statutes that you guys pass they're not
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
upholding them they're finding ways to
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
go around them um
 
01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.070 align:start position:0%
go around them um
but

01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
then you go to all these other agencies
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they're not
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
they don't want to do anything about it
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
so i think that filing the appeal to the
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
superior court is really it's going to
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
create that paper trail because that's
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
what you need you need to have that
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
paper trail in order to have
 
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:45.669 align:start position:0%
paper trail in order to have
a

01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
more effective
 
01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.470 align:start position:0%
more effective
action

01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
by the legislature because that's what
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
checks and balances is about in our
 
01:27:53.199 --> 01:27:55.189 align:start position:0%
checks and balances is about in our
government

01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing none
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
i will move on to
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
you've asked for five minutes and we're
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
35 minutes
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
over our time
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
so if we can make it
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
brief and not repeat information we've
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
already heard i'd appreciate it thank
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
you and i think i can do that because a
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
lot of people earlier covered points
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to cover so
 
01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:29.910 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to cover so
um

01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
again for the record my name is dana
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
albrecht and you heard me testify
 
01:28:34.159 --> 01:28:35.590 align:start position:0%
albrecht and you heard me testify
previously

01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
and i support this bill i've had a lot
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
of appeals
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
in my case and i'll get to that
 
01:28:43.199 --> 01:28:45.669 align:start position:0%
in my case and i'll get to that
momentarily

01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
momentarily
 
01:28:45.679 --> 01:28:46.709 align:start position:0%
momentarily
uh

01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:46.719 --> 01:28:48.310 align:start position:0%
uh
but

01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh echoing the prior testimony there's a
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
lot of cases where appeals simply don't
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
get heard at all because they're
 
01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:58.310 align:start position:0%
get heard at all because they're
discretionary

01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
discretionary
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so you have
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
fundamentally no right of appeal
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
to anywhere
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
of a family court division
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
and i've got uh an exhibit if that could
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
go around you don't need to look at it
 
01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:14.629 align:start position:0%
go around you don't need to look at it
now

01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
you probably don't even need to read it
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
all it's just a good case study thank
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
you in how this happens
 
01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:23.669 align:start position:0%
you in how this happens
um

01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
but first i'd like to address something
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
that the judicial branch said in their
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
analysis of this bill
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
they talk about a scenario where half of
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
family division cases
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
might be appealed to superior court so i
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
guess my question for them
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
is are they saying that the family
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
division is so messed up
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
that in half of all cases
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
there's an aggrieved party
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
who is sufficiently aggrieved to want an
 
01:29:54.159 --> 01:29:55.270 align:start position:0%
who is sufficiently aggrieved to want an
appeal

01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
because if that's true we've likely got
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
a much bigger problem
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
than we could solve with any of these
 
01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
bills so maybe they could address that
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
next i'd like to point out that at the
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
state level
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
41 of the 50 states
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
have an intermediate appellate court
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
there's only nine that don't
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
and we're one of them
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
so back to my case where
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
i've actually filed a number
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
of appeals
 
01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.229 align:start position:0%
of appeals
um

01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
and again the exhibit is simply a case
 
01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.790 align:start position:0%
and again the exhibit is simply a case
study

01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
um i don't expect you to read it
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
carefully heck the trial court sure
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
didn't read any of this stuff it was
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
their job they didn't do it
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
so just please remember that i had paul
 
01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.270 align:start position:0%
so just please remember that i had paul

and
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
i just want you to realize that if i
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
thought their orders were wrong in
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
practice i don't necessarily get to
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
appeal to anyone
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
and there's your case study
 
01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.950 align:start position:0%
and there's your case study
um

01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
let me tighten this up
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
just pointing out we have discretionary
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me mandatory appeals under
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
supreme court rule 7a
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
and discretionary appeals under supreme
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
court rule 7b
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh which require a process called
 
01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.070 align:start position:0%
uh which require a process called
certiorari

01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
certiorari
 
01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:29.510 align:start position:0%
certiorari
you

01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:31.189 align:start position:0%
you
heard

01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
more on that earlier if you need more
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
from me you can ask me in the questions
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
um this is typically because of the
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
caseload up at the appellate court
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
so for example the u.s supreme court
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
would only hear four to six percent of
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
all cases
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh they just don't have time to hear all
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
of them so they take the big ease of
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
national importance and those are the
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
ones you read about in the news again
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
that's u.s supreme court
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and again the
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
big problem i'm trying to bring up is
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court kind of works
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
the same way they don't have to hear
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
your case
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i think you already heard in prior
 
01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.270 align:start position:0%
and i think you already heard in prior
testimony

01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.709 align:start position:0%
testimony
the

01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
um situations in which they don't so i
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
won't repeat that
 
01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:24.709 align:start position:0%
won't repeat that
um

01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.719 --> 01:32:25.669 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
just a quick note on that case study
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh what we've got here
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
is a case
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
in which all of the judges involved
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
julian tricasso mark derby
 
01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.910 align:start position:0%
julian tricasso mark derby
claimed

01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
claimed
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
not to actually know anything about the
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
orders they signed
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
and so i wanted to appeal that
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i had no right of appeal so i guess
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
my rhetorical question to this committee
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
is what's my remedy in this situation
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
i mean i sent it all the way up
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
i wasn't expecting the us supreme to
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
hear it i mean i'm not of national
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
importance but it's
 
01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:03.910 align:start position:0%
importance but it's
really

01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's why it's such a good case study
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
in which there is no
 
01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:10.070 align:start position:0%
in which there is no
recourse

01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
and this was just about a
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
julian tricasa order where they wouldn't
 
01:33:14.239 --> 01:33:15.430 align:start position:0%
julian tricasa order where they wouldn't
enforce

01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
my cross-country parenting plan all i
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
was trying to do is get a cross-country
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
parenting plan enforced
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
and when the trial court didn't do that
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
you know i wanted to
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
send it up and i couldn't so that's the
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
and i would just point out where all the
 
01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
family court judges
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
involved claiming to know nothing about
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
the orders they signed
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not making that up that's in the
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
official record it's in hearing
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
transcripts and it's in sworn jcc
 
01:33:46.719 --> 01:33:48.790 align:start position:0%
transcripts and it's in sworn jcc
depositions

01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
depositions
 
01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:51.830 align:start position:0%
depositions
um

01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
so i guess
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
kind of i'm saying if we think we got
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
the wrong decision
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
why can't we go up to some next level
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
intermediate state court as an appeal by
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
right just like we can in 41 other
 
01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:07.910 align:start position:0%
right just like we can in 41 other
states

01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
finally in closing i'd also say that
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
most of the complaints i've heard from
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
other people about family court
 
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
involve a claim that the judge got all
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
most of the complaints i've heard from
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
other people about family court involve
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
a claim that the judge got all the facts
 
01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:33.750 align:start position:0%
a claim that the judge got all the facts
wrong

01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
typically because they failed to read
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
pleadings at all or failed to look at
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
evidence at all along with some kind of
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
documentary evidence that the aggrieved
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
party claims proves that again they
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
they're just making a claim
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
my question is what's the remedy
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
if an aggrieved party
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
wants to make that kind of claim and i
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
think it's the superior court and it's
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
not our supreme court and that's why i
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
support this bill and i'd be happy to
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
you're

01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%

welcome the next person i have is vivian
 
01:35:16.239 --> 01:35:23.990 align:start position:0%
welcome the next person i have is vivian
gerard

01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
and you've asked for two minutes i might
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman and members
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee again my name is vivian
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
gerard as you heard my testimony earlier
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm just a mom
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer but i had four appeals
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
this new hampshire supreme court
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
and my lawyer won all of that for me
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
and it's still not
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
fixed was extremely expensive and
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
probably took a toll on the court system
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
it definitely has taken a toll on my
 
01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.109 align:start position:0%
it definitely has taken a toll on my
family

01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
i've heard some of these complex
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
case dockets were some
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
but where
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
i found them in the basement of the
 
01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:28.709 align:start position:0%
i found them in the basement of the
courthouse

01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
courthouse
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.639 --> 01:36:35.830 align:start position:0%
 
hello

01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
hello
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
bueller euler
 
01:36:39.199 --> 01:36:40.390 align:start position:0%
bueller euler
bueller

01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
bueller
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody know that reference
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
is it the supreme court the only way to
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
even try to get my
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
case fixed
 
01:36:54.719 --> 01:36:56.390 align:start position:0%
case fixed
anyways

01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
a question for the committee and you
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to answer this right now
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
do you think if my case
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
had just gone up to the superior court
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
the first time around and stayed there
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
that i'd still be in this mess
 
01:37:12.639 --> 01:37:14.229 align:start position:0%
that i'd still be in this mess
anyways

01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
at julian dicasso's plea hearing and
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
sentence hearing
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
my friends and i actually
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
even tried to intervene at the superior
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
court just to have the right to be heard
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's all judge temple denied that
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
and said that my complaint related to my
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
specific case
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
and there
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
are other remedies
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
so can anyone on this committee tell me
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
what those remedies are
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
i guess parking my truck out front of
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
the national court didn't work
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
because in the document i hand it out to
 
01:37:48.639 --> 01:37:49.590 align:start position:0%
because in the document i hand it out to
you

01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's my truck
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
in that photo within that exhibit i hand
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
it out to you
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm trying to support this
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
bill and i'll take any questions that
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
you may have
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%

the court process a lot more something i
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
never thought i would have to do and i'm
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%

earlier
[Music]

01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
in my and in my situation
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
took

01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
took
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation in a temporary hearing
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
and a judge signed off on it and i went
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
eight weeks
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
on a temporary order that then turned
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
into a permanent order
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's terrifying to think
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
what do i do i don't know what to do
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
i've been told you go to the supreme
 
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
court and then
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
then i hear stories like other people
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
that tell me
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
good luck good luck um
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
to me that's scary i'm already petrified
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
of the result i had do i want to
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
emotionally keep putting myself through
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
that and my daughter
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
um no it would have been nice to have a
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
d is it a de novo hearing
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
um to maybe have all the evidence to
 
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
hear both testimonies
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
um without anybody being
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
biased in my situation um we would hope
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
i that we wouldn't have to go there
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
right to the the supreme court or the
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
superior court we would hope that people
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
that are evaluating our families
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
would do their job so we wouldn't have
 
01:40:02.719 --> 01:40:04.470 align:start position:0%
would do their job so we wouldn't have
to

01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
have more emotional stress
 
01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.070 align:start position:0%
have more emotional stress
um

01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
and and keep asking for for things when
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're not being looked at
 
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
so i guess i you know learning like i
 
01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
so i guess i you know learning like i
said

01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
a bill that would help a lot of families
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know um and therefore i support it
 
01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:28.390 align:start position:0%
you know um and therefore i support it
um

01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
any questions i'm happy to answer but
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
again i'm just a mom i don't really i'm
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer i don't know a lot about it
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
but to me and what i've heard in
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
families a chance if they weren't hurt
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe hold people accountable to do
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
their jobs so it wouldn't be handed down
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
and down and then objected and then it
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
just seems very complicated and
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think the average person that's
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
trying to work and provide
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
should know these things or have to pay
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
the expenses
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
justice like i just feel people should
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
do their jobs and we wouldn't have this
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
right we wouldn't be sitting here today
 
01:41:09.119 --> 01:41:10.390 align:start position:0%
right we wouldn't be sitting here today
um

01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you again madame chairman thank
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
you family law and committee thank you
 
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
and our final person will be the
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
honorable dan itza you've asked for five
 
01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.030 align:start position:0%
honorable dan itza you've asked for five
minutes

01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
i'll do my best to be less
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
committee for the record i'm danitz i
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
currently reside in manchester
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
the most critical aspect of this
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
bill is the de novo nature of the appeal
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
the problem arises primarily out of the
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
manner in which evidence is received in
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
the family court person and family court
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
can be
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh confronted with what i call ambush
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
evidence something that they were not
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
going into the hearing and therefore are
 
01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:00.629 align:start position:0%
going into the hearing and therefore are
not

01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
prepared to rebut
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
it can be by the opposing party it can
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
be by the gal but they are then stuck
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
unless they or their attorney if they
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
have one
 
01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:12.470 align:start position:0%
have one
is

01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
well enough prepared to make an offer of
 
01:42:15.119 --> 01:42:16.470 align:start position:0%
well enough prepared to make an offer of
proof

01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
proof
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
then they can make no more rebuttal of
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
that in any future proceedings
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
their first recourse is what's called a
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
reconsideration in which you bring the
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
case back before the judge that just
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
heard the case
 
01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
when in that case not being able to
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
enter any additional evidence the
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
probability of achieving a different
 
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
result is extremely low
 
01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.189 align:start position:0%
result is extremely low
[Music]

01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can get a reconsideration
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
before a different judge if the if you
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
can make cause for the judge to be
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
recused from the case
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
or you can repeal to the supreme court
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
which may or may not hear your case in
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
any case you can't present
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
any additional
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
evidence because you're limited to what
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of this can be alleviated by
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
statutes you might
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
contrive to regulate or require
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
information evidence to be submitted the
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
other thing that you heard was instances
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
where the judge openly defies the
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
statutes the legislature has
 
01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.470 align:start position:0%
statutes the legislature has
instituted

01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
there is recourse for that but that also
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
resides with you and it's under part 2
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
article 38 i would suggest you read it
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's for mal administration in office
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much and with
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%

01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:59.510 align:start position:0%
and um does anybody need a refresher
break

01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:02.629 align:start position:0%
 
huh

01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:02.639 --> 01:44:04.310 align:start position:0%
 
soon

01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
soon
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%

01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
haste is so important right now
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to do a little bit of
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%

01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you go ahead
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
for your caring i feel i feel that way
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 1265
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
relative to a judge's discretion to set
 
01:44:58.709 --> 01:44:58.719 align:start position:0%
aside rules and family court proceedings
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
is totally legal right now
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
the magistrate marital master whoever is
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
in charge of the proceedings
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
is permitted to set aside
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
any of the family court rules
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
and so that means that when you come in
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
i don't want to call it litigant
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
a participant
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh party
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
when you come in you don't have any
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
rules that you can cling to
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
state your case because any of the rules
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
can be set aside so this just very
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
simply says
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
they can't do it the rules that are
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
there need to be followed and somebody
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
said well if they're going to set aside
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
fees don't you want them to be able to
 
01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
do that so so we added that and my my
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
personal feeling is it's not in the bill
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
because it's not
 
01:45:51.679 --> 01:45:52.870 align:start position:0%
because it's not
polite

01:45:52.870 --> 01:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
polite
 
01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:53.669 align:start position:0%
polite
it's

01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
if it's a bad rule don't have it in the
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
rules so that's
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
that's my whole testimony
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative gay uh
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
i mean every every governing body has
 
01:46:13.119 --> 01:46:14.149 align:start position:0%
i mean every every governing body has
rules

01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh that they are allowed to override
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
those rules i mean we have it in the
 
01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:19.030 align:start position:0%
those rules i mean we have it in the
house

01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:20.550 align:start position:0%
house
um

01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
we have to we have rules
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
and we can change those rules when we
 
01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:26.350 align:start position:0%
vote on them correct so
 
01:46:26.350 --> 01:46:27.910 align:start position:0%
vote on them correct so

i mean i
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to grasp how
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
rules don't get changed once they're
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
established they

wouldn't get changed until
[Music]

01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
yearly or
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:48.709 align:start position:0%
i mean
any

01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
should i can answer sure i'm thinking
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
there must be a process where the rules
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
are made
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
and this is just one of the rules
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the very first rule
 
01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:00.149 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the very first rule
that

01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
all the subsequent rules can be
 
01:47:02.159 --> 01:47:04.149 align:start position:0%
all the subsequent rules can be
overruled

01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
overruled
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
i understand discretion sounds really
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
great maybe there ought to be a set of
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
rules that are discretionary but as it
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
is now we have pages and pages of rules
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
that nobody can count on because it's
 
01:47:16.159 --> 01:47:17.990 align:start position:0%
that nobody can count on because it's
the

01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.189 align:start position:0%
the
option

01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
to ignore them
 
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that is fair for
 
01:47:22.719 --> 01:47:23.750 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that is fair for
people

01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
to go in on what's a very scary
 
01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:27.270 align:start position:0%
to go in on what's a very scary
situation

01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
and not have anything to be confident
 
01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.590 align:start position:0%
and not have anything to be confident
about

01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you thank you thank you
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative belanger you have a
 
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
you representative gay for being here
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
and answering the questions for this
 
01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.070 align:start position:0%
and answering the questions for this
committee

01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
and when we refer to judicial discretion
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
what exactly in an example can you give
 
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to solve what's the
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
problem that you're trying to solve as
 
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:12.149 --> 01:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
well since i'm not an attorney and have
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
the rottnest memory in the entire world
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
i could compete
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that so many of examples
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
given today
 
01:48:24.149 --> 01:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
of things that went wrong were against
 
01:48:24.159 --> 01:48:25.430 align:start position:0%
of things that went wrong were against
rules

01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
they weren't following procedure
 
01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:28.870 align:start position:0%
they weren't following procedure
so

01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to guess that among the many
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
some of those happen to be
 
01:48:33.679 --> 01:48:34.470 align:start position:0%
some of those happen to be
a

01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
violation of not violation but setting
 
01:48:37.679 --> 01:48:39.030 align:start position:0%
violation of not violation but setting
aside

01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
aside
 
01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.189 align:start position:0%
aside
rules

01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
there are many pages of rules but i just
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
stopped at the first two
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that people don't have the
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know are denied rights because there
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
the next person i have
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
is uh richard head
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to waive rules is
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
one of those sort of
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
necessary concepts that a judge needs to
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
be able to have
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
to ensure that that what they're doing
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
makes sense in the context of a specific
 
01:49:47.599 --> 01:49:48.470 align:start position:0%
makes sense in the context of a specific
case

01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
there may be you can disagree with a
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
specific decision to waive a rule
 
01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:54.790 align:start position:0%
specific decision to waive a rule
but

01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
if the judge is going to have an orderly
 
01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:00.870 align:start position:0%
if the judge is going to have an orderly
and

01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:01.830 align:start position:0%
and
thorough

01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
thorough
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the parties to be heard
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
there are instances in which rules need
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be waived
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
what is unclear from this bill is
 
01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:11.750 align:start position:0%
what is unclear from this bill is
what

01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
is there a specific rule that we're
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
talking about as opposed to all rules
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
all context all family division cases
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
because again we're talking about
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
a wide range of cases that fall within
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
family division each of those types of
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
cases has their own sort of
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
body of rules
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
and and really what we're talking about
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
is a blanket
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
rules must be applied whether or not
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to be fair in a particular
 
01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
circumstance or
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
or activity so
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the rules regarding
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
adoption domestic violence um uh
 
01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:50.390 align:start position:0%
adoption domestic violence um uh
guardianships

01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
guardianships
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
invo um
 
01:50:52.719 --> 01:50:53.990 align:start position:0%
invo um
marriage

01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
marriage
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights and a
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
host of others and this
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
statute would say under no circumstances
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
in all cases in the family division the
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
judge has zero discretion in waiving any
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
rule no matter how inconsequential that
 
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
waiver may be and in fact not waving may
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
prove to be harmful we're talking about
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know as i said before 25 000 cases
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
being filed every one of those has their
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
own nuances and change in little quirks
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
about them and maybe a rule needs to be
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
waived in order to provide fairness to
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
the parties what this statute says is
 
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
nope no waiver no rules can be waived
 
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.589 align:start position:0%
nope no waiver no rules can be waived
sorry

01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
you have to follow exactly what the rule
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
says no matter how unfair it may be
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
and and and what is unclear from the
 
01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:42.229 align:start position:0%
and and and what is unclear from the
bill

01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
is are we talking about a specific rule
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
and then secondarily and i think the the
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
question was raised is
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
should the rule be changed and if the
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
rules should be changed there is a rules
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
committee in the court system that rules
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
committee does have a member that from
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
the house of representatives and a
 
01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
member from the from the state senate
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
that sits on it if there is a rule that
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
should be changed really the the best
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle and and process for that is to
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
go to the rules committee and say
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with this rule you
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
should look at it and and that can be
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
introduced through the representative
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
member through the senator member but i
 
01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:20.070 align:start position:0%
member through the senator member but i
think

01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is you know the
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
operation of the
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
of the courts that is that is typically
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
maintained through a court rule
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
not through a statute that says
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know we don't know what what rule
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
we're talking about we think you should
 
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
apply them all without regard to to any
 
01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:39.750 align:start position:0%
apply them all without regard to to any
waivers

01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's just it's too broad and
 
01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
really the proper process is other
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
specific rules that are at issue and if
 
01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:47.669 align:start position:0%
specific rules that are at issue and if
so

01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
those rules should be evaluated through
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
the the process of drafting rules
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
and there is a process and there is a
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
membership that that can allow the house
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
or the senate uh to bring those forward
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions for
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair uh
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
is there when a judge waves the rule is
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
there always an explanation as to why he
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
waived the rules
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
is that required is that a rule no it's
 
01:54:02.719 --> 01:54:04.070 align:start position:0%
is that required is that a rule no it's
required

01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
no it is not the rule does not say that
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh it just says
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
rules can be waived except
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
stat except if required by statute okay
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
they don't need a reason
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
they don't have to tell the parties what
 
01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
of this waiver is
 
01:54:19.199 --> 01:54:21.030 align:start position:0%
of this waiver is
my

01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
my experiences they do but um
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
i can't cite you a rule that says that
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
they're required to put it in writing or
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
or tell the parties uh okay
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you it's my general experiences i
 
01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.189 align:start position:0%
thank you it's my general experiences i
do

01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bolandja thank
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you mr head for
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
is it not an advisory committee that's
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct they don't write
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
the rules but they do provided they
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
bring input on the rules follow-up can
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
you give me a definition of the
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
difference between an advisory committee
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
and someone who tells somebody
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
can you give me the difference between
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
an advisory committee
 
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question an advisory
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee is what its title suggests it
 
01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:04.870 align:start position:0%
committee is what its title suggests it
provides

01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
provides
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
information and recommendations it does
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
not have the authority to implement
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so with respect to
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
to an advisory committee only
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
if if someone has an issue
 
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
that representative or that senator can
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
maybe say
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
we advise that we change that but it
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to get done is that correct
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's correct um but but that is the
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism and that's the process by
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
which our rules are developed is
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
with input from the from the advisory
 
01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:39.589 align:start position:0%
with input from the from the advisory
committee

01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
so i guess may i follow up again final
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up i don't know about that we'll
 
01:55:44.239 --> 01:55:45.430 align:start position:0%
follow-up i don't know about that we'll
see

01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
um i guess i'm just kind of curious
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
why would the
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
why does the judicial branch feel that
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
having such a high
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
and then only having an advisory i mean
 
01:56:03.669 --> 01:56:03.679 align:start position:0%
if you look at this bill it is
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support
 
01:56:05.599 --> 01:56:06.790 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support
both

01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
both both representatives and a senator
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
on each side of the aisle so i'm curious
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
why the judicial branch doesn't feel
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
like this is a problem
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
because it is
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
i i think the
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about in terms of
 
01:56:22.639 --> 01:56:23.430 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about in terms of
of

01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
of what i'm presenting is
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
the rules go through a a fairly
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
substantive process both with the with
 
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
the rules committee um
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
which as you said is advisory and the
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
court itself
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
to implement the rules if there is in
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
what a
 
01:56:42.629 --> 01:56:42.639 align:start position:0%
i suspect they're going to be people who
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
will testify about a specific rule in a
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
specific instance
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
if there are specific rules that should
 
01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:50.070 align:start position:0%
if there are specific rules that should
be

01:56:50.070 --> 01:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
reevaluated or considered
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's a that's a
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
a a more structured way of approaching
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
it simply saying we are eliminating all
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
discretion in all circumstances
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
all of the court rules in family
 
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.270 align:start position:0%
all of the court rules in family
division

01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
i think the the
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
the level of unintended consequences
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
that flow from that can be significant
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
and severe
 
01:57:19.119 --> 01:57:20.149 align:start position:0%
and severe
um

01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
and what i'm what i'm suggesting is that
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about court process
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
and procedure
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism for doing that is through the
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
rules and through the rules that apply
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
that are that are created by the
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
so i do think it is that that process is
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
one more
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
final one
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering the question um
 
01:57:51.199 --> 01:57:55.109 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering the question um
so

01:57:55.109 --> 01:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
i'm a judge right
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
and i choose to
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
use my judicial discretion to
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
make a decision
 
01:58:04.159 --> 01:58:05.589 align:start position:0%
make a decision
that

01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
i feel is the right way based on my own
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
personal experience of the case that's
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
being presented in front of me
 
01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
so i make
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
a huge change and i'm using this as an
 
01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:18.709 align:start position:0%
a huge change and i'm using this as an
example

01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
because i have that judicial discretion
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
but i have maybe unintended biases
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:29.679 align:start position:0%
do you believe that that's not being
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of in many family case
 
01:58:33.199 --> 01:58:34.709 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of in many family case
hearings

01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
i think there are you know as i said
 
01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:38.149 align:start position:0%
i think there are you know as i said
before

01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:58:38.159 --> 01:58:40.470 align:start position:0%
before
um

01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
roughly 25 000 cases filed every year i
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
think the judges
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:49.599 --> 01:58:50.709 align:start position:0%
 
do

01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
work very hard to implement
 
01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:55.189 align:start position:0%
work very hard to implement
the

01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
the intent of the statutes that they're
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
following and the rules that are before
 
01:58:58.480 --> 01:58:59.910 align:start position:0%
following and the rules that are before
them

01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
and they're trained and they receive
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
training on a whole host of of
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not mistakes get made
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
i can't say no mistakes are ever made in
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
the family division but i do think that
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
the judges when we're talking about
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
cases involving children they try
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
very hard to apply the best interests of
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
the child standard i think if there are
 
01:59:27.669 --> 01:59:27.679 align:start position:0%
if there are instances in which a rule
 
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be waived in order for them to
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
receive information about the best
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
interests of the child they may do that
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
you may get some better insight if you
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
ask the question from judge lemire this
 
01:59:39.430 --> 01:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon she unfortunately had a trial
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
today and won't free up until after two
 
01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:43.589 align:start position:0%
today and won't free up until after two
o'clock

01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:59:46.149 --> 01:59:46.159 align:start position:0%
but i i think
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
you have judges that are
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
working very hard
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
to do what is
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
described in the statute and applying
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
the result that the case the facts
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
and the evidence
 
02:00:06.639 --> 02:00:08.070 align:start position:0%
and the evidence
present

02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
present
 
02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:12.550 align:start position:0%
present
sometimes

02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
what is being heard in court has to be
 
02:00:16.709 --> 02:00:16.719 align:start position:0%
the evidence that the judge is relying
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
upon and and the judge is is going to
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
make the best decision based upon the
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
evidence that is presented and based
 
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
upon this the statutory guidelines that
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
are provided i think in the vast vast
 
02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:30.550 align:start position:0%
are provided i think in the vast vast
majority

02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
majority
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
vast majority of these cases
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
you have a very diligent judge doing
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
that i'm not going to make excuses for
 
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
judge intercoson
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to make excuses where
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
somebody like judge intercostal has done
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
something wrong what i am saying is that
 
02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:47.350 align:start position:0%
something wrong what i am saying is that
this

02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:48.470 align:start position:0%
this
bill

02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
would in all cases in the family
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
division in all circumstances prevent
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
any discretion on the part of the judge
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
i think that is
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
a step further than really what it is is
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
what is the goal of this committee i
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
think what
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
if you if you have a specific rule that
 
02:01:08.070 --> 02:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
has been waived and has been waived
 
02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:09.990 align:start position:0%
has been waived and has been waived
unfairly

02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
unfairly
 
02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's a different conversation
 
02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
than what this bill is and i'm just here
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
to address the bill
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
which says all rules cannot be waived
 
02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
under any circumstance under any of the
 
02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
types of cases that are presented in
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
family division
 
02:01:26.629 --> 02:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
and i think that the unintended
 
02:01:31.589 --> 02:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
representative rung
 
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you mr head for
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question you made a couple
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
comments in your opening statement that
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
waving rules is often necessary for
 
02:01:46.149 --> 02:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
orderly and thorough hearings and that
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
not waving could be harmful
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
would you provide an example or two of
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
that please uh when i i probably
 
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say often uh so i if i said
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
often that was that was unintended on my
 
02:01:58.870 --> 02:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
part um i i
 
02:01:58.880 --> 02:01:59.910 align:start position:0%
part um i i
i

02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
it's probably a better job question for
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
judge lemire and i apologize i did not
 
02:02:06.070 --> 02:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
sort of take a survey ahead of time on
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
what what circumstances they may be
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
considering a waiver of a rule usually
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:15.589 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's probably a better question i
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
apologize i just didn't come up with
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
examples before today okay thanks i
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
apologize i'd like to declare that
 
02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative wrong is a co-sponsor on
 
02:02:25.990 --> 02:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
i should not have called on i'm sorry i
 
02:02:31.109 --> 02:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
apologize for that but thank you for
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
answering the question anyway mr head
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
but we do have one more question from
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question this question is more
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
of a broader that i have been hearing
 
02:02:48.149 --> 02:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
all these bills
 
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
so far so the question is i have been
 
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
hearing um thousands of bills or
 
02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of cases are being filed each
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
year and there are backlogs um in the
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
court system how are they prioritizing
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
those cases is there do they go by the
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
dates that has been filed or
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
based on the case scenario i'm just
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my head around this
 
02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:15.589 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my head around this
so

02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
it it's a fair question so the you know
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
as i said
 
02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
circuit court has roughly 125 000 cases
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
in that involves probate division
 
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
district division family division
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
probate division is sort of set aside
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
because those are largely now being
 
02:03:33.199 --> 02:03:34.390 align:start position:0%
because those are largely now being
handled

02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
handled
 
02:03:36.149 --> 02:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
in in concord at the administrative
 
02:03:38.070 --> 02:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
office of courts where they don't need
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
to have trials so that's sort of a
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
separate issue so i'm going to set that
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
aside district division and family
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
division those cases are prioritized in
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
a number of ways and i won't get them
 
02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:49.990 align:start position:0%
a number of ways and i won't get them
all

02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:03:52.550 --> 02:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
but uh so for example criminal cases may
 
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
have uh if there if there's a potential
 
02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:57.910 align:start position:0%
have uh if there if there's a potential
for

02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:59.189 --> 02:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
a jail term
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
those have constitutional priorities
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
there are some statutes in which the
 
02:04:06.550 --> 02:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
legislature has provided priorities
 
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
within the statutory language
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
it is a question also sometimes of how
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
long is the proceeding going to be is it
 
02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:16.870 align:start position:0%
long is the proceeding going to be is it
a

02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
30 minute hearing is it a four day trial
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
so you know it depends on
 
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
what judges are available what are the
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
what other cases
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
have to be heard either through a
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement or
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
through another statutory deadline so
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
for example during the course of a day
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence petitions may be filed
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
you can have
 
02:04:40.159 --> 02:04:41.350 align:start position:0%
you can have
a

02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights cases
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
that are pending you know various as i
 
02:04:45.679 --> 02:04:46.390 align:start position:0%
that are pending you know various as i
said

02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
family division is not just divorce
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
in their each one of those may have
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
their own internal required deadlines
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
and then you have those that have no
 
02:04:57.510 --> 02:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
specific deadline
 
02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:58.709 align:start position:0%
specific deadline
within

02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
within
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
family division
 
02:05:04.069 --> 02:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
they roughly are able to
 
02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
get to a final decision in roughly 75
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
percent of the cases within a year
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
and then beyond that
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
you know some of them do take multiple
 
02:05:13.199 --> 02:05:14.069 align:start position:0%
you know some of them do take multiple
years

02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
some cases are
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
heavily litigated
 
02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
and have just boxes and boxes of
 
02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:22.629 align:start position:0%
and have just boxes and boxes of
pleadings

02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
pleadings
 
02:05:22.639 --> 02:05:23.830 align:start position:0%
pleadings
um

02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
and and those
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
tend to just take longer
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
and they're just highly contested
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
obviously the goal is
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
we have we have sort of internal goals
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
of trying to
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
um get a certain percentage out within
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
six months and within a year
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
but you know it's it's managing the
 
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
entire docket and that's done by staff
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
at each of the courts they know you know
 
02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:48.390 align:start position:0%
at each of the courts they know you know
they

02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:50.719 align:start position:0%
basically you don't want aged cases to
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
be continued to to sit so you know it's
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
really a very complex
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
case management role that our clerks
 
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
handle and handle every day
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
within each of the courts
 
02:06:04.709 --> 02:06:04.719 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
it really become can be fairly
 
02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:08.629 align:start position:0%
it really become can be fairly
complicated

02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
with regard to backlogs
 
02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:12.550 align:start position:0%
with regard to backlogs
there

02:06:12.550 --> 02:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
clearly were some some
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
things that were slowed down during the
 
02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
course of the pandemic
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
roughly in
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
in circuit court i'm not talking family
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
division but circuit court generally
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
they were holding even during through
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
the pandemic about 15 000 hearings a
 
02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:36.470 align:start position:0%
the pandemic about 15 000 hearings a
month

02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
it's a very
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
busy complex system that that gets set
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
up but
 
02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
i can't give you you know any particular
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
cases going to be heard within a certain
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
it is it's the clerks working very hard
 
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
with the mix of cases that they have
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
before them and and what have fixed
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
statutory deadlines what have
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional deadlines what don't
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
what's the length of the proceeding what
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
are the unique circumstances an
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
interpreter needed
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
you know a whole host of
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
things go into into scheduling
 
02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
um long winded answer i apologize but
 
02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's no easy sort of
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
shortcut to sort of how these things get
 
02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:26.310 align:start position:0%
shortcut to sort of how these things get
scheduled

02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you miss had any further
 
02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:29.270 align:start position:0%
uh thank you miss had any further
questions

02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
see you none thank you mr head thank you
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i am katrina heinrich
 
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
just listening to to our judicial
 
02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:09.910 align:start position:0%
just listening to to our judicial
representative

02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh i i wonder a question popped into my
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
mind he talks about the complexity
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
of the cases
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
does the system itself
 
02:08:22.629 --> 02:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
is it such a complex system that our
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
in expediency and haste
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
i'm going to quote from goldstein well
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
known for his research on this topic
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
he stated that professionals who looked
 
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
at these cases found a pattern of
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
mistakes and dangerous outcomes
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
court professionals reacted defensively
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
to any research questioning of their
 
02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:51.830 align:start position:0%
to any research questioning of their
practices

02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
practices
 
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
the assumption continued that when the
 
02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
our friend from the judicial also talked
 
02:09:05.599 --> 02:09:09.430 align:start position:0%
our friend from the judicial also talked
about

02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
reasons being given
 
02:09:11.199 --> 02:09:12.390 align:start position:0%
reasons being given
and

02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:14.310 --> 02:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
at no time in my case have i been given
 
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
any reasons for the waving of
 
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
rules or rights or any
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
anything else one of the biggest
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
leads to question if the family court
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
judges have evolved to rely on the
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
ability to just dismiss and apply
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
specific rules that they choose
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
1.2 and 2.2 which i spoke of earlier
 
02:09:42.390 --> 02:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
waves the right to due process you
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
cannot submit evidence you cannot have
 
02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:46.550 align:start position:0%
cannot submit evidence you cannot have
witnesses

02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
witnesses
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
all the cases we're talking about have
 
02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
that similarity
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
in my specific case
 
02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
i have an issue for the fact that
 
02:09:58.470 --> 02:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
envelopes are being passed in court with
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
we don't know what in it we don't know
 
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
if it's evidence we don't know if it's
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
money we we have no idea what's in these
 
02:10:05.679 --> 02:10:06.790 align:start position:0%
money we we have no idea what's in these
envelopes

02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
envelopes
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
and they were being passed
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
from the guardian at latime to the judge
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
the judge was accepting him the judge
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
would peek in them
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
and we never knew regardless of our
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
question the right to see it
 
02:10:18.239 --> 02:10:19.270 align:start position:0%
question the right to see it
so

02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:21.270 --> 02:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
with that said in my case the new
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire rules that were consistently
 
02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:24.550 align:start position:0%
hampshire rules that were consistently
abused

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
abused
 
02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
and dismissed was
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
specifically for me
 
02:10:34.629 --> 02:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
it was evidence you cannot get evidence
 
02:10:34.639 --> 02:10:37.510 align:start position:0%
it was evidence you cannot get evidence
in

02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
one of the other issues that is really
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
huge in all of these cases and i'm sure
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
if they all take the time the requisite
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
time and think about it
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
is that by eliminating the right to
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
submit all of this
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
the courts are also extending that
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
by eliminating your right to bring in
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
family history my case didn't exist i
 
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
had a divorce
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
everything was set
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
but the moment the papers were signed i
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
was back in court for no reasons
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
i was told specifically by judge cross
 
02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:10.390 align:start position:0%
i was told specifically by judge cross
that

02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:12.069 --> 02:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
there would be no family history there
 
02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
would be no official documents school
 
02:11:16.229 --> 02:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
records medical records we started from
 
02:11:16.239 --> 02:11:19.830 align:start position:0%
records medical records we started from
zero

02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's literally eliminating our family
 
02:11:25.109 --> 02:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
life in every aspect
 
02:11:27.669 --> 02:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
post divorce
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
so i question
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
the ability of the court to exercise
 
02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:34.390 align:start position:0%
the ability of the court to exercise
judgment

02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
over post-divorce issues that are truly
 
02:11:37.199 --> 02:11:39.350 align:start position:0%
over post-divorce issues that are truly
issues

02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
in my case ex partes were just filed
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
randomly even by the guardian at
 
02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
the ex partes were frivolous there was
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
no evidence for the expertise but yet
 
02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
they were granted this extended our case
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
out to where we are now well over a
 
02:11:58.719 --> 02:12:00.950 align:start position:0%
out to where we are now well over a
decade

02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
decade
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
guardian at light and made a lot of
 
02:12:06.069 --> 02:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
these ex partes
 
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
without evidence
 
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
did nothing
 
02:12:14.550 --> 02:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
but emulate imminent harm
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
and that is due to waving of the rules
 
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
of due process
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:33.750 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
testimony

02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
my name is alicia brochu once again i am
 
02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill
 
02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:54.069 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill
um

02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
the reason why i support this bill is
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
very simple judges have and they do set
 
02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
aside the court rules and when they do
 
02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
so they're not looking out for the best
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
interest of the children because that is
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
foremost what these family court judges
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
are supposed to do is look out for the
 
02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
best interest of these children when it
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
comes to parenting cases
 
02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:16.790 align:start position:0%
comes to parenting cases
um

02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
the rules themselves provide a framework
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
for how these matters are pleaded and
 
02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:23.599 align:start position:0%
the procedures that are supposed to be
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
adhered to so when the judge sets aside
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
the court rules uh it sends a message
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
that in the family court forget what you
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
think you know about law
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
and the legal system it is the wild west
 
02:13:36.719 --> 02:13:37.830 align:start position:0%
and the legal system it is the wild west
of

02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
the court uh when i was taking my legal
 
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
classes i had to take a quite a few
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
family law classes and my family law
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
professor actually sat there and told us
 
02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
don't get into family law
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
take it because if you do take
 
02:13:52.709 --> 02:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
everything you think you know and throw
 
02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
it out the window
 
02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:55.350 align:start position:0%
it out the window
uh

02:13:55.350 --> 02:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
when was
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
my husband's rights to two of his
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
children were terminated and the
 
02:14:01.750 --> 02:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
lifelong contact order was placed that i
 
02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier it wasn't because
 
02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
there was a finding of abuse neglect or
 
02:14:09.669 --> 02:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
abandonment it was because he failed to
 
02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
appear at a hearing
 
02:14:13.589 --> 02:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
the mother reopened the case
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
and she did not serve him
 
02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
and there was no proof of surface filed
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
with the court
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
the judge decided to set aside the court
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
rules regarding service and proof of
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
service and stripped the children of
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
their loving father
 
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
and that isn't even the worst tragedy
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
the worst tragedy of that came lasting a
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
year later when the exeter police
 
02:14:37.510 --> 02:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
department knocked on our door at two
 
02:14:38.830 --> 02:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the
 
02:14:41.669 --> 02:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
morning asking if he could take physical
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
possession of the children
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
the mother was found several blocks away
 
02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
from the home
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
high on drugs in a tree
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
the children were left home alone they
 
02:14:56.709 --> 02:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
i will never forget the look of anguish
 
02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
on his face when he had to tell the
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
officer that he could not help his
 
02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:04.310 align:start position:0%
officer that he could not help his
children

02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
because there was a no contact order in
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
place prohibiting him from doing so
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
all because the judge set aside court
 
02:15:12.079 --> 02:15:13.109 align:start position:0%
all because the judge set aside court
rules

02:15:13.109 --> 02:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:15:15.189 --> 02:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
and it's not just the judges that we
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
hear in the news that do this that order
 
02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
was signed by judge foley
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
who is retired now and he's actually um
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
very highly regarded in the judicial
 
02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:27.109 align:start position:0%
very highly regarded in the judicial
system

02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:15:27.119 --> 02:15:27.990 align:start position:0%
system
um

02:15:27.990 --> 02:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
in other cases of his because my husband
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
has multiple children
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
i've seen the judges set aside court
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
rules regarding deadlines for answering
 
02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:36.870 align:start position:0%
rules regarding deadlines for answering
pleadings

02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
pleadings
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
um and the time that they have to
 
02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:41.599 align:start position:0%
actually issue orders all the to the
 
02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
detriment of the children
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the case riaz now has primary
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
residential responsibility for his
 
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
daughters the judge waited on average 10
 
02:15:52.229 --> 02:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
days beyond the deadline for the
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
republican respondent's attorney to file
 
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
an answer to his motions for contempt
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
for violation of the parenting plan
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
there were 23 of them
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
filed by the time the case was settled
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
they never saw a hearing
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
the same case and a different judge
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
there was an ex parte motion that was
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
filed by the mother conveniently right
 
02:16:19.830 --> 02:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
before he was supposed to start his
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
overnight stating claiming that he
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
kicked his two-year-old across the room
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
the initial orders were granted a
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
hearing was set they had the hearing the
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
judge waited four months
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
to reverse the ex parte orders
 
02:16:39.509 --> 02:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
saying that those allegations were
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
unfounded so his child lost four months
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
of parental contact for nothing because
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
so in the meantime these children have
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
to deal with the emotional distress of
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
having their father ripped out of their
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
life again and again
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
all because the judge used their
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
discretion to set aside court rules
 
02:17:07.349 --> 02:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but as the gentleman and the
 
02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
smashing thai stated earlier it's for
 
02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.589 align:start position:0%
smashing thai stated earlier it's for
expediency

02:17:11.589 --> 02:17:11.599 align:start position:0%
expediency
 
02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
but these judges are not there to be
 
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
expedient they are there to protect
 
02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:17.270 align:start position:0%

02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
best interest of children and the way
 
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
that it is now
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
they're putting their convenience
 
02:17:26.639 --> 02:17:28.150 align:start position:0%
they're putting their convenience
and

02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
above what they're supposed to be doing
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
and that is looking out for the best
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
you've asked for one minute
 
02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman and members of the
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
committee thank you again for having me
 
02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
up here um my name again is vivian
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
gerard um and in my case julie and
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
dicasso constantly
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
allowed my ex to file items so late
 
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
that it was very biased against me
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
not allowing my lawyer enough time to
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
prepare for hearings
 
02:18:34.469 --> 02:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
my attorney said these multiple late
 
02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
filings have blindsided me judge julian
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
dicasso also allowed my ex to submit
 
02:18:45.429 --> 02:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
evidence after the fact but not me
 
02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
those were multiple serious violations
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
of the family division rules that really
 
02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
hurt me in my case
 
02:18:52.399 --> 02:18:53.270 align:start position:0%
hurt me in my case
and

02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
this book that i have here i did not
 
02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
make everybody copies but if you would
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
like it i can get it to you but this is
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
when the judge has too much discretion
 
02:19:05.429 --> 02:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
i had to go to the supreme court
 
02:19:05.439 --> 02:19:06.629 align:start position:0%
i had to go to the supreme court
and

02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:09.509 --> 02:19:09.519 align:start position:0%
fight just what's in here because of her
 
02:19:09.519 --> 02:19:11.990 align:start position:0%
fight just what's in here because of her
discretions

02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
discretions
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much all i have but i
 
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
do have one comment
 
02:19:17.429 --> 02:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
to richard head obviously there's
 
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
problems with the rules
 
02:19:21.509 --> 02:19:21.519 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how this is fair that
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
i have to go through this for one
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
hearing to have those rules fixed
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
through the supreme court
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
for one case
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
and she did not tell me why she did not
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
follow the rule but this is my last
 
02:19:37.359 --> 02:19:38.549 align:start position:0%
follow the rule but this is my last
hearing

02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
to get those discretions fixed
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
so if you have any questions i'll be
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them thank you any
 
02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:45.830 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them thank you any
questions

02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
02:19:56.230 --> 02:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:00.309 --> 02:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:02.550 --> 02:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman chairwoman
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
excuse me again for the record my day
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
name is dana albrecht you've heard me
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
testify previously
 
02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
first i'd just like to remark if you've
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
got a bill with great intent but maybe
 
02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
there are some issues in the specific
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
language a pro proposed let's address
 
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
that with amendments
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
to that end i actually just emailed the
 
02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:24.150 align:start position:0%
to that end i actually just emailed the
committee

02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
some proposed language changes to this
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
bill that i think would address
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of mr head's concerns
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
respectfully i asked you look at that
 
02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:35.110 align:start position:0%
respectfully i asked you look at that
offline

02:20:35.110 --> 02:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
offline
 
02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:37.510 align:start position:0%
offline
um

02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
back to what i had prepared i just want
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
to say if we had this law
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps has amended amended that maybe i
 
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have needed to go up to the new
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court on my last
 
02:20:52.469 --> 02:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
appeal at all and spend a year getting a
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
vacate and remand when instead the
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
family division judge could have just
 
02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
followed the rules
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
um speaking to a specific rule
 
02:21:05.429 --> 02:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
family division rule 126 e
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
it requires that motions that are not
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
ascended to will be held from 10 for 10
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
days from the filing date of the motion
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
to allow other parties time to respond
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
unless justice requires an earlier court
 
02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:18.710 align:start position:0%
unless justice requires an earlier court
ruling

02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
ruling
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
so this is the opposite problem of
 
02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:21.910 align:start position:0%
so this is the opposite problem of
vivian

02:21:21.910 --> 02:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
vivian
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
they're not given me
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
the time the rule allows and they're
 
02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
given the other party in her case far
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
more time
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
than the rule allows
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
and so i just like to echo what alicia
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
broshu i forgive i mispronounced that
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
said earlier
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
where you've got aggrieved parties that
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
feel they have false accusations against
 
02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:46.870 align:start position:0%
feel they have false accusations against
them

02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
that would be me
 
02:21:51.349 --> 02:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
i've done nothing to deserve
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence restraining order
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
against me i got one anyway i appealed
 
02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
it to the new hampshire supreme court
 
02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
they gave me a vacate and remand
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
um if you want any further details under
 
02:22:05.190 --> 02:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
the underlying circumstances let's save
 
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
it for questions because we should focus
 
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
on the bill we're discussing
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
um just suffice it to say i'm a peaceful
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
person never committed a violent act
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
back to the rule
 
02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:19.670 align:start position:0%
back to the rule
um

02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:21.910 --> 02:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
unless there's an ex parte or emergency
 
02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:23.349 align:start position:0%
unless there's an ex parte or emergency
situation

02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
the court is supposed to hear from both
 
02:22:26.399 --> 02:22:27.590 align:start position:0%
the court is supposed to hear from both
parties

02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
parties
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
before it decides what to do about
 
02:22:29.439 --> 02:22:30.550 align:start position:0%
before it decides what to do about
something

02:22:30.550 --> 02:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
but in my tv case that the supreme court
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
just remanded
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
ruled judge curran ruled ex part a on
 
02:22:41.830 --> 02:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
the other party's motion when there was
 
02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:43.270 align:start position:0%
the other party's motion when there was
no

02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
reason he couldn't waited ten days to
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
allow me to present my side of the story
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
and file an objection it wouldn't have
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
been prejudicial in any way we were just
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
talking about changing something
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know that's what you should have
 
02:22:55.840 --> 02:22:56.630 align:start position:0%
you know that's what you should have
done

02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
and then figured it out after hearing
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
both sides of the story
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i think this is a widespread problem
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
that goes a lot
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
goes across a lot of different
 
02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
underlying types of cases
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier from laura montgomery
 
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
about getting
 
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
kathleen sternenberg appointed by an
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
ex-part email with only 27 minutes to
 
02:23:22.710 --> 02:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
object what do you do
 
02:23:24.790 --> 02:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
enter kids taken away by
 
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
that in an ex part a proceeding
 
02:23:29.590 --> 02:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
and another one where kids were taking
 
02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
away in a 20-minute review hearing so
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
following the rules
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
that allow a party
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
who's had serious
 
02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
accusations leveled against them
 
02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
to actually be able to respond to those
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
and approach
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
appropriately have at least an
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to rebut them so the judge
 
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
hears both sides and we can figure it
 
02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:54.469 align:start position:0%
hears both sides and we can figure it
out

02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:23:54.479 --> 02:23:56.150 align:start position:0%
out
um

02:23:56.150 --> 02:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:59.030 --> 02:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
and i consider that the real problem
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh what we're really looking for is just
 
02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
to get the right decisions
 
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
out of court cases as much as we can
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
so i would just suggest that we
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
adopt this or maybe some amended version
 
02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
or just do something
 
02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
so we can address this issue
 
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
let's fix it and i'll take any questions
 
02:24:25.030 --> 02:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%

i was previously represented by an
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
attorney but at some point you kind of
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%

who are left to testify
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%

03:09:05.750 --> 03:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll call on
 
03:09:07.990 --> 03:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative dan it's a
 
03:09:09.190 --> 03:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
you're up
 
03:09:09.200 --> 03:09:11.190 align:start position:0%
you're up
kiddo

03:09:11.190 --> 03:09:11.200 align:start position:0%

03:09:17.349 --> 03:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
less than five minutes thank you
 
03:09:17.359 --> 03:09:35.910 align:start position:0%
less than five minutes thank you
um

03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:39.269 --> 03:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
representative long um
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
made the uh raise the idea that
 
03:09:43.510 --> 03:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
in session or
 
03:09:45.910 --> 03:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
you change house rules regularly
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
but i want you to imagine
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
the equivalent of what happens to the
 
03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
litigants and family court
 
03:09:54.309 --> 03:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
you go into session
 
03:09:56.150 --> 03:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
and normally you have an order of
 
03:09:58.550 --> 03:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
precedence on the bills as to which
 
03:09:58.560 --> 03:09:59.750 align:start position:0%
precedence on the bills as to which
motions

03:09:59.750 --> 03:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
motions
 
03:10:01.910 --> 03:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
supersede other motions
 
03:10:06.389 --> 03:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
but what if on any particular bill
 
03:10:06.399 --> 03:10:07.750 align:start position:0%
but what if on any particular bill
the

03:10:07.750 --> 03:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:10:09.910 --> 03:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
speaker might change the order of
 
03:10:14.070 --> 03:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
precedence based upon whom the
 
03:10:15.910 --> 03:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative was making the motion and
 
03:10:19.429 --> 03:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
how much experience he thought they had
 
03:10:21.990 --> 03:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
and that's the kind of situation you
 
03:10:25.510 --> 03:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:27.030 --> 03:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
03:10:29.910 --> 03:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh mr head's concern and some of the
 
03:10:32.710 --> 03:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
concerns of the committee regarding
 
03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
03:10:38.469 --> 03:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
number was the over 200 family court
 
03:10:38.479 --> 03:10:39.750 align:start position:0%
number was the over 200 family court
rules

03:10:39.750 --> 03:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:10:41.910 --> 03:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
and this says that none of them can be
 
03:10:41.920 --> 03:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
and this says that none of them can be
waived

03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
waived
 
03:10:45.429 --> 03:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
and there will be unintended
 
03:10:45.439 --> 03:10:49.349 align:start position:0%
and there will be unintended
consequences

03:10:49.349 --> 03:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:50.950 --> 03:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
i would suggest
 
03:10:53.349 --> 03:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
that if the committee wanted was not
 
03:10:55.750 --> 03:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
inclined to adopt the proposal before
 
03:10:55.760 --> 03:10:57.269 align:start position:0%
inclined to adopt the proposal before
them

03:10:57.269 --> 03:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:11:00.950 --> 03:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
that they might take a different measure
 
03:11:04.229 --> 03:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
which is to require the judge
 
03:11:06.630 --> 03:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
when he wants to waive a rule to cite
 
03:11:08.710 --> 03:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
the rule that he's waving
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
make the justification for it
 
03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
which makes it actionable on uh in
 
03:11:19.030 --> 03:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
further hearings it can be objected to
 
03:11:19.040 --> 03:11:20.630 align:start position:0%
further hearings it can be objected to
um

03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:23.269 --> 03:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
it would it could then also be put into
 
03:11:25.830 --> 03:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
a court or into a database
 
03:11:27.910 --> 03:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
that would cite
 
03:11:30.229 --> 03:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
the the judge
 
03:11:32.070 --> 03:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
the case
 
03:11:34.550 --> 03:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
the court rule the justification
 
03:11:36.469 --> 03:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
and which party in the case
 
03:11:39.670 --> 03:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
the what the rule was waived for
 
03:11:41.830 --> 03:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
and that would give the judiciary and
 
03:11:44.469 --> 03:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
the uh legislature
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
the power to see patterns
 
03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
and if there is a pattern are there one
 
03:11:51.910 --> 03:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
or two judges that are
 
03:11:53.429 --> 03:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
principally involved in waiving the
 
03:11:53.439 --> 03:11:54.550 align:start position:0%
principally involved in waiving the
rules

03:11:54.550 --> 03:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:11:57.830 --> 03:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
three or four limited number
 
03:12:01.110 --> 03:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
when it when a judge is predisposed to
 
03:12:03.670 --> 03:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
waive rules or disposed away rules is it
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
happening in favor of one party or the
 
03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:07.910 align:start position:0%
happening in favor of one party or the
other

03:12:07.910 --> 03:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
those are very salient points as to know
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
and is there a particular rule that's
 
03:12:15.990 --> 03:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
getting consistently waived
 
03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:17.030 align:start position:0%
getting consistently waived
because

03:12:17.030 --> 03:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:12:21.510 --> 03:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:23.830 --> 03:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
those are all parcels of information
 
03:12:26.710 --> 03:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
that need to be brought out
 
03:12:27.990 --> 03:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
if if
 
03:12:29.349 --> 03:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
there were
 
03:12:31.830 --> 03:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
a particular judge waiving rules
 
03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:33.269 align:start position:0%
a particular judge waiving rules
consistently

03:12:33.269 --> 03:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
03:12:33.279 --> 03:12:34.389 align:start position:0%
consistently
then

03:12:34.389 --> 03:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:12:36.469 --> 03:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
the legislature would be disposed to
 
03:12:40.790 --> 03:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
but you can't know what you you can't
 
03:12:45.510 --> 03:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
act on what you don't know
 
03:12:47.670 --> 03:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take any questions
 
03:12:51.830 --> 03:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:56.070 --> 03:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:00.229 --> 03:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
next i'll call on is it gail
 
03:13:02.950 --> 03:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:02.960 --> 03:13:06.630 align:start position:0%
 
gail

03:13:06.630 --> 03:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:21.269 --> 03:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:23.190 --> 03:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
while she's getting her things together
 
03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to let you know that we have
 
03:13:27.670 --> 03:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
been receiving your emails
 
03:13:30.229 --> 03:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
and i i just want you to know that this
 
03:13:32.630 --> 03:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
during this these hearings this is not
 
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:37.670 --> 03:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:13:40.830 --> 03:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
your emails will be taken into
 
03:13:43.750 --> 03:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
consideration they will not fall onto on
 
03:13:46.229 --> 03:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
closed eyes
 
03:13:50.309 --> 03:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
but there will be no rebuttal process
 
03:13:52.710 --> 03:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
everybody's information is important to
 
03:13:54.790 --> 03:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
us and
 
03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
we're the ones that get to ask the
 
03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
questions not the general audience
 
03:14:02.550 --> 03:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate your emails but if you
 
03:14:07.110 --> 03:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:11.990 --> 03:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
gail you did not write in um a time
 
03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
so i'll give you two minutes okay okay
 
03:14:16.950 --> 03:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd like to give other
 
03:14:18.150 --> 03:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
background but i'm going to submit it to
 
03:14:20.309 --> 03:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
you so that that's no big deal but thank
 
03:14:22.550 --> 03:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
you i am in support of this bill um i
 
03:14:25.190 --> 03:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
think too many rules are being
 
03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:27.990 align:start position:0%
think too many rules are being
overlooked

03:14:27.990 --> 03:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:29.830 --> 03:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
such as
 
03:14:31.830 --> 03:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
opposing councils are
 
03:14:33.750 --> 03:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
getting into private bank accounts
 
03:14:35.349 --> 03:14:35.359 align:start position:0%
without properly
 
03:14:37.269 --> 03:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
without even
 
03:14:39.269 --> 03:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
letting the other party know
 
03:14:40.630 --> 03:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
and the judges are not doing anything
 
03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
about that so
 
03:14:43.990 --> 03:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's a civil rights violation
 
03:14:46.070 --> 03:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i
 
03:14:47.269 --> 03:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
really think the judge should have
 
03:14:50.790 --> 03:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
addressed that in the hearing
 
03:14:52.870 --> 03:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
and not let that go so
 
03:14:55.190 --> 03:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important that rules
 
03:14:57.349 --> 03:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
should not be set aside for
 
03:14:59.670 --> 03:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
for their peers
 
03:15:01.590 --> 03:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:15:07.190 --> 03:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:08.469 --> 03:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:15:11.269 --> 03:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
03:15:15.429 --> 03:15:15.439 align:start position:0%
next we have miss aaron justina
 
03:15:18.389 --> 03:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
and you've asked for two minutes
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair and members
 
03:15:27.030 --> 03:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is aaron
 
03:15:29.030 --> 03:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
justina and i direct the domestic
 
03:15:30.870 --> 03:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
violence advocacy project at new
 
03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire legal assistance
 
03:15:36.630 --> 03:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
i had not planned on testifying today i
 
03:15:39.510 --> 03:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
did sign in opposed but
 
03:15:41.830 --> 03:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
a quick review of the family court rules
 
03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to point out a few things
 
03:15:47.429 --> 03:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
that there are situations where it may
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
be beneficial and even safer for
 
03:15:53.429 --> 03:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
litigants to have some discretion
 
03:15:55.269 --> 03:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
in waiving some of these court rules and
 
03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
i'll just give you a few examples if
 
03:15:59.510 --> 03:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful thank you
 
03:16:04.229 --> 03:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
rule 1.25 addresses discovery deadlines
 
03:16:05.830 --> 03:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
it allows for
 
03:16:08.110 --> 03:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
a response to interrogatories and
 
03:16:08.120 --> 03:16:09.670 align:start position:0%
a response to interrogatories and
interrogatories

03:16:09.670 --> 03:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
interrogatories
 
03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
are those questions
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
that one side can ask to the other side
 
03:16:16.630 --> 03:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
and there's a 30-day response
 
03:16:19.269 --> 03:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
deadline to those interrogatories
 
03:16:21.510 --> 03:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
so if someone had access to information
 
03:16:24.229 --> 03:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
and it was beyond the 30 days
 
03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
it may be helpful to the person's case
 
03:16:30.790 --> 03:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
to have that information submitted um
 
03:16:32.950 --> 03:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
and so it would be necessary if that
 
03:16:35.349 --> 03:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
information wasn't available until after
 
03:16:38.150 --> 03:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
the 30 days for a judge to say all right
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
upon request i've looked at that and
 
03:16:44.229 --> 03:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
you know this is information that would
 
03:16:46.229 --> 03:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
be helpful in this case so i'm going to
 
03:16:48.389 --> 03:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
extend that deadline so that would be
 
03:16:51.110 --> 03:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
helpful in that situation for that
 
03:16:52.870 --> 03:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
rule to be waived
 
03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
another one is rule 2.11 which
 
03:16:58.710 --> 03:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
deals with first appearance
 
03:17:00.229 --> 03:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
for those of you who don't know first
 
03:17:01.910 --> 03:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
appearance is
 
03:17:04.790 --> 03:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
required for all parties
 
03:17:06.550 --> 03:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
either in a divorce or parenting case
 
03:17:08.710 --> 03:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
involving minor children you have to
 
03:17:11.349 --> 03:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
attend first appearance
 
03:17:13.510 --> 03:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
and it gives you really
 
03:17:15.269 --> 03:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
an idea of what the family court process
 
03:17:17.590 --> 03:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
will look like and it's also the time
 
03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
when your first
 
03:17:21.110 --> 03:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
court deadlock court hearing or
 
03:17:23.510 --> 03:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
mediation will be scheduled
 
03:17:27.030 --> 03:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
that role 2.11 b requires attendance by
 
03:17:28.389 --> 03:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
both parents
 
03:17:31.030 --> 03:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
and both parents are expected to attend
 
03:17:33.030 --> 03:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
the same first appearance
 
03:17:34.710 --> 03:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
so if there's a domestic violence
 
03:17:37.190 --> 03:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
03:17:39.429 --> 03:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be safe for the parties to
 
03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
attend first appearance together you
 
03:17:43.429 --> 03:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
would want to waive that court rule or
 
03:17:45.030 --> 03:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
you would want to make a request that
 
03:17:47.190 --> 03:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
that rule be waived
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
rule 2.10 involves the child impact
 
03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:51.269 align:start position:0%
rule 2.10 involves the child impact
seminar

03:17:51.269 --> 03:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
seminar
 
03:17:52.870 --> 03:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
that rule states that any action
 
03:17:54.870 --> 03:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
involving married or unmarried parents
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
of minor children the party shall attend
 
03:18:00.309 --> 03:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
the child impact seminar um somebody may
 
03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
make a request that this rule be waived
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
so for example if you didn't want to
 
03:18:07.190 --> 03:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
have to let's say you attended a child
 
03:18:09.269 --> 03:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
impact seminar two years ago and now
 
03:18:10.950 --> 03:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
you're involved in a new family court
 
03:18:12.710 --> 03:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
case where it's required that you attend
 
03:18:15.190 --> 03:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
the child impact seminar again
 
03:18:17.269 --> 03:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't want to necessarily since
 
03:18:18.950 --> 03:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
probably not a whole lot of new material
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
in one or two years you may not want to
 
03:18:23.910 --> 03:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
attend that child impact seminar again
 
03:18:25.590 --> 03:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
it's time away from work time away from
 
03:18:27.269 --> 03:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
your kids more money that's a very
 
03:18:29.990 --> 03:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
lengthy seminar i think it's four hours
 
03:18:31.510 --> 03:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
so you might want the judge to waive
 
03:18:33.190 --> 03:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
that role so you don't have to attend
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
the child impact seminar again and you
 
03:18:38.389 --> 03:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
can just show your certificate
 
03:18:41.190 --> 03:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
rule 2.8 is in regards to children
 
03:18:44.070 --> 03:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
testifying and that rule states a child
 
03:18:45.670 --> 03:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
shall not be brought to court as a
 
03:18:45.680 --> 03:18:46.630 align:start position:0%
shall not be brought to court as a
witness

03:18:46.630 --> 03:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
witness
 
03:18:47.910 --> 03:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i will just point out that
 
03:18:50.229 --> 03:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
representative gay is a sponsor of a
 
03:18:53.429 --> 03:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
bill this afternoon hb 1550 which seeks
 
03:18:55.670 --> 03:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
to waive that very rule
 
03:18:57.429 --> 03:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
so i did just want to point that out and
 
03:18:59.429 --> 03:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your time in allowing me to
 
03:19:01.670 --> 03:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
testify and to i'm happy to answer any
 
03:19:01.680 --> 03:19:02.710 align:start position:0%
testify and to i'm happy to answer any
questions

03:19:02.710 --> 03:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:10.870 --> 03:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
the final person to testify would be
 
03:19:15.910 --> 03:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative cody belander
 
03:19:25.670 --> 03:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and fellow members
 
03:19:29.190 --> 03:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee i wasn't going to
 
03:19:32.070 --> 03:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
testify today but
 
03:19:35.110 --> 03:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is very important to me
 
03:19:36.790 --> 03:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
i have testified before this committee
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
and has spoken to many of you
 
03:19:40.389 --> 03:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
individually about my history with the
 
03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
family court
 
03:19:44.070 --> 03:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
most recently
 
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
referee foley
 
03:19:47.670 --> 03:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
from the rochester district court dover
 
03:19:49.429 --> 03:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
district court excuse me
 
03:19:49.439 --> 03:19:51.590 align:start position:0%
district court excuse me
um

03:19:51.590 --> 03:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:54.150 --> 03:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
told me in a court hearing that his
 
03:19:56.950 --> 03:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
court his rules
 
03:19:59.510 --> 03:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
he has an issue with pro se litigants
 
03:20:01.110 --> 03:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
i am a pro se litigant because i
 
03:20:03.030 --> 03:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
understand the law i may not have went
 
03:20:04.950 --> 03:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
to school for it but it doesn't take a
 
03:20:12.710 --> 03:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough after that hearing
 
03:20:18.389 --> 03:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
i'd googled
 
03:20:20.790 --> 03:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
referee foley
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
and he had and there is a yelp review
 
03:20:26.309 --> 03:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
for the rochester district court
 
03:20:32.710 --> 03:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:34.389 --> 03:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
we have an issue
 
03:20:36.309 --> 03:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
in our state and i've been saying this
 
03:20:37.750 --> 03:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
for years prior to becoming a
 
03:20:40.710 --> 03:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative and i'm saying it now
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
and i'll continue saying it until these
 
03:20:44.070 --> 03:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
issues are fixed
 
03:20:45.910 --> 03:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion is a problem within
 
03:20:47.990 --> 03:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
our family court system
 
03:20:49.429 --> 03:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
it needs to end
 
03:20:53.030 --> 03:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i support the bill as written
 
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:59.990 --> 03:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:21:07.670 --> 03:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh now the last speaker did you hear her
 
03:21:10.469 --> 03:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
justification of waivers in
 
03:21:12.550 --> 03:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed
 
03:21:16.950 --> 03:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:17.990 --> 03:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
03:21:19.590 --> 03:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so i would be
 
03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
opposed to any waiver that allows for
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
any form of judicial discretion
 
03:21:27.269 --> 03:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
that allows for a judge to overrule any
 
03:21:30.070 --> 03:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion that he sees or she
 
03:21:32.389 --> 03:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
sees fit because
 
03:21:32.399 --> 03:21:34.150 align:start position:0%
sees fit because
unfortunately

03:21:34.150 --> 03:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
03:21:37.269 --> 03:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
we see a lot of the times myself in the
 
03:21:38.550 --> 03:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
two hearings with the two different
 
03:21:40.309 --> 03:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
judges that i've had
 
03:21:41.830 --> 03:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:21:41.840 --> 03:21:43.269 align:start position:0%
in the
other

03:21:43.269 --> 03:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:21:45.670 --> 03:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
cases that i'm aware of families just in
 
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
my district alone
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
who are having these issues that there
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
are unintended biases towards families
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
and it's a problem
 
03:21:58.070 --> 03:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
great thanks thank you
 
03:22:01.030 --> 03:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:03.830 --> 03:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions and seeing no
 
03:22:05.429 --> 03:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
other pink cards
 
03:22:09.910 --> 03:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
i will close the hearing on
 
03:22:09.920 --> 03:22:13.110 align:start position:0%
i will close the hearing on
1265.

03:22:13.110 --> 03:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:15.190 --> 03:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to now re open the hearing
 
03:22:19.190 --> 03:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1142
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
i believe the
 
03:22:23.110 --> 03:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor would like to speak
 
03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:51.269 --> 03:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:53.190 --> 03:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:55.269 --> 03:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
relative to the right to submit evidence
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
and testimony family court proceedings
 
03:23:00.389 --> 03:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
as we have just been discussing
 
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:23:05.910 --> 03:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
some of the rules are make give
 
03:23:08.630 --> 03:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
tremendous discretion and this rule is
 
03:23:09.830 --> 03:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
written in
 
03:23:09.840 --> 03:23:10.710 align:start position:0%
written in
that

03:23:10.710 --> 03:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
on test
 
03:23:13.510 --> 03:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
issue of testimony
 
03:23:13.520 --> 03:23:15.190 align:start position:0%
issue of testimony
and

03:23:15.190 --> 03:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:23:18.469 --> 03:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
evidence you cannot present it
 
03:23:21.830 --> 03:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
in your case unless the judge
 
03:23:23.590 --> 03:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
gives you permission
 
03:23:26.229 --> 03:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
so it's not a right
 
03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
and then we learn that if you appeal
 
03:23:32.550 --> 03:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
your case as currently you would appeal
 
03:23:33.910 --> 03:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court
 
03:23:36.389 --> 03:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
you can't bring it up then
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:23:40.389 --> 03:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
that's why it's very simple we just want
 
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
to get rid of that rule and so that
 
03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
people have the right to present
 
03:23:47.190 --> 03:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh evidence
 
03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
and testimony
 
03:23:51.670 --> 03:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
so if you have any questions
 
03:23:54.630 --> 03:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
03:23:57.030 --> 03:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none i appreciate your time thank
 
03:24:00.630 --> 03:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
you next i'd like to call uh
 
03:24:05.030 --> 03:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:07.349 --> 03:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh you're asking for five minutes
 
03:24:09.510 --> 03:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
probably won't either thank you kindly
 
03:24:11.510 --> 03:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
03:24:15.750 --> 03:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
03:24:17.590 --> 03:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
03:24:19.670 --> 03:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
this bill would
 
03:24:21.510 --> 03:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
put in the in the
 
03:24:23.670 --> 03:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
give the capacity to any party to
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
provide any testimony or any evidence
 
03:24:29.269 --> 03:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so for example let's take
 
03:24:32.389 --> 03:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
this hearing that we're here for today
 
03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's not that unlike a court proceeding
 
03:24:35.750 --> 03:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of people you have a lot
 
03:24:37.349 --> 03:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
of bills you have a lot of people that
 
03:24:39.269 --> 03:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
want to come testify
 
03:24:42.630 --> 03:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
and you have a limited amount of time so
 
03:24:45.030 --> 03:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
you are limiting the amount of time that
 
03:24:46.469 --> 03:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
i have to speak
 
03:24:48.469 --> 03:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
appropriately so because everyone's
 
03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
testimony is important all the issues
 
03:24:53.030 --> 03:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
are important and what you're asking is
 
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we come and present testimony that
 
03:24:56.950 --> 03:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
is relevant to the bill that's before
 
03:24:59.510 --> 03:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
you and we've heard that today too
 
03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what a judge is doing when
 
03:25:04.630 --> 03:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
they're in a proceeding and they're
 
03:25:04.640 --> 03:25:07.590 align:start position:0%
they're in a proceeding and they're
asking

03:25:07.590 --> 03:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:09.190 --> 03:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
for the for the
 
03:25:10.710 --> 03:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
parties to
 
03:25:12.870 --> 03:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
present evidence that is relevant to the
 
03:25:16.150 --> 03:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
case the way this bill reads is
 
03:25:18.070 --> 03:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
the parties in any proceeding have the
 
03:25:21.269 --> 03:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
right to present evidence and testimony
 
03:25:23.910 --> 03:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
as written it is unlimited
 
03:25:26.710 --> 03:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
they can come and provide testimony on
 
03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
anything they can come and provide
 
03:25:31.429 --> 03:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
evidence on anything and it's unlimited
 
03:25:34.870 --> 03:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of time and scope so what the
 
03:25:36.950 --> 03:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
significant concern about this bill at
 
03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:44.469 --> 03:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
every case can get out of hand almost
 
03:25:47.910 --> 03:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
immediately you have a judge who is who
 
03:25:50.309 --> 03:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
has a number of cases that have to be
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
heard that day all of them are
 
03:25:53.510 --> 03:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
incredibly important
 
03:25:55.510 --> 03:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
all of the information is important and
 
03:25:57.990 --> 03:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
what the judges need is testimony that
 
03:26:00.870 --> 03:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
relates to the issue that is before the
 
03:26:03.110 --> 03:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
judge and evidence that is related to
 
03:26:05.110 --> 03:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
that issue and once you start going
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
outside of that you start to lose the
 
03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
ability to to hear all of the cases that
 
03:26:12.710 --> 03:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
day to have all of the parties present
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
information and testimony and as written
 
03:26:17.590 --> 03:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
this would essentially provide
 
03:26:17.600 --> 03:26:18.790 align:start position:0%
this would essentially provide
unfettered

03:26:18.790 --> 03:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
unfettered
 
03:26:21.190 --> 03:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
discretion on the parties as to what
 
03:26:23.110 --> 03:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
they present how long they're presenting
 
03:26:23.120 --> 03:26:23.990 align:start position:0%
they present how long they're presenting
and

03:26:23.990 --> 03:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:26:25.990 --> 03:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh the nature of that of that
 
03:26:28.150 --> 03:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
information and evidence and quickly all
 
03:26:30.150 --> 03:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
hearings will get out of control and
 
03:26:31.990 --> 03:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why the judge needs to
 
03:26:34.229 --> 03:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
be able to control what is the evidence
 
03:26:36.630 --> 03:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
and what is the testimony if the intent
 
03:26:38.950 --> 03:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
to this bill is to say
 
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
every case you're entitled to have
 
03:26:43.510 --> 03:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
evidence and testimony okay again these
 
03:26:46.309 --> 03:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
are family court proceedings which again
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
we don't family court family division
 
03:26:49.830 --> 03:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
these are not
 
03:26:51.750 --> 03:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
all marital cases
 
03:26:53.590 --> 03:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
every party does have a right to an
 
03:26:56.550 --> 03:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearing in a in a marital
 
03:26:56.560 --> 03:26:57.910 align:start position:0%
evidentiary hearing in a in a marital
case

03:26:57.910 --> 03:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
unless waived
 
03:27:03.510 --> 03:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
that said not every issue is entitled to
 
03:27:06.870 --> 03:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
a trial you get ultimately on the on the
 
03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
case itself an evidentiary hearing
 
03:27:10.950 --> 03:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
unless it is waived
 
03:27:10.960 --> 03:27:11.910 align:start position:0%
unless it is waived
but

03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:27:13.670 --> 03:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
what is really very unclear about this
 
03:27:15.990 --> 03:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
03:27:18.790 --> 03:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
what what types of of cases what types
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
of i'm sorry what type yeah what types
 
03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
of cases are we talking about
 
03:27:22.640 --> 03:27:23.510 align:start position:0%
of cases are we talking about
um

03:27:23.510 --> 03:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:25.590 --> 03:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
because not every case needs to have a
 
03:27:27.670 --> 03:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
hearing so there are large number of
 
03:27:30.469 --> 03:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
probate cases that get resolved without
 
03:27:32.950 --> 03:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
a hearing it just happens but that is
 
03:27:32.960 --> 03:27:33.830 align:start position:0%
a hearing it just happens but that is
the

03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:36.309 --> 03:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
and and so in in family division there
 
03:27:38.229 --> 03:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
are also other types of cases that do
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
not need a hearing to be resolved
 
03:27:44.950 --> 03:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
this this bill just as written is so
 
03:27:48.550 --> 03:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
broad that it it will it will
 
03:27:51.670 --> 03:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
prevent the courts from doing anything
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
and being able to do their their jobs
 
03:27:55.750 --> 03:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
and be able to get to the issues and to
 
03:27:58.150 --> 03:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
be able to resolve those issues
 
03:28:01.030 --> 03:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
unless you want to add
 
03:28:03.750 --> 03:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
a significantly larger court system
 
03:28:05.110 --> 03:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's ultimately your
 
03:28:05.120 --> 03:28:06.389 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's ultimately your
goal

03:28:06.389 --> 03:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
goal
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
it just is not manageable as written so
 
03:28:11.590 --> 03:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
we would oppose this bill as written
 
03:28:12.790 --> 03:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd be happy to take any
 
03:28:12.800 --> 03:28:14.790 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd be happy to take any
questions

03:28:14.790 --> 03:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:28:16.790 --> 03:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you do i see any questions
 
03:28:18.870 --> 03:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you madam
 
03:28:21.910 --> 03:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
chair so in your opinion the parties
 
03:28:23.750 --> 03:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
shall have the right to present evidence
 
03:28:25.750 --> 03:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
and testimony
 
03:28:27.510 --> 03:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
is that just the parties presented
 
03:28:29.990 --> 03:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
evidence and testimony or do you read
 
03:28:31.269 --> 03:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
this as
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
the testimony can be from
 
03:28:34.080 --> 03:28:35.269 align:start position:0%
the testimony can be from
anybody

03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:28:38.550 --> 03:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
the the bills about the parties um okay
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
so but it doesn't say at what stage so
 
03:28:43.990 --> 03:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
is it the initial
 
03:28:46.469 --> 03:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
the initial conference um to the final
 
03:28:46.479 --> 03:28:47.670 align:start position:0%
the initial conference um to the final
trial

03:28:47.670 --> 03:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
trial
 
03:28:49.110 --> 03:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
but it but at least that's written it's
 
03:28:52.150 --> 03:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
the parties okay thank you
 
03:28:55.590 --> 03:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
03:28:57.349 --> 03:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
03:28:57.359 --> 03:28:58.790 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

03:28:58.790 --> 03:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:29:02.070 --> 03:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
next i'll call on katrina henrik
 
03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.269 --> 03:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
and again i'll
 
03:29:16.950 --> 03:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
remind you that if you have written
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
testimony please submit it for the
 
03:29:18.720 --> 03:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
testimony please submit it for the
record

03:29:37.110 --> 03:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
again i'm katrina heinrich
 
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
i am here for this bill because i do
 
03:29:46.630 --> 03:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:48.070 --> 03:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
any party should have the right to
 
03:29:50.469 --> 03:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
evidence in my case
 
03:29:52.469 --> 03:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
the court denied my right to due process
 
03:29:54.550 --> 03:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
as guaranteed by the 5th and 14th
 
03:29:55.830 --> 03:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
amendments of the bill of rights the
 
03:29:57.910 --> 03:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
excuse i understand
 
03:30:02.870 --> 03:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
is rule 1.2 and 2.2.
 
03:30:04.710 --> 03:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
but there's no explanation as to why
 
03:30:06.790 --> 03:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:30:09.590 --> 03:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
the family division is
 
03:30:13.030 --> 03:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
a piece of our court system
 
03:30:14.950 --> 03:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
that should afford litigants to have the
 
03:30:16.870 --> 03:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
right to evidence
 
03:30:18.870 --> 03:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
and testimony just like a civil and
 
03:30:20.950 --> 03:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
criminal case
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
i understand that we want to make it
 
03:30:25.030 --> 03:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
family friendly
 
03:30:26.790 --> 03:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
but that's not what is occurring in
 
03:30:28.389 --> 03:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
twenty percent of these cases if not a
 
03:30:32.710 --> 03:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:34.469 --> 03:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
in my case orders are then written
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
without due process but carry the burden
 
03:30:41.190 --> 03:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
of legally binding decisions
 
03:30:43.830 --> 03:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
with consequences and no options for
 
03:30:43.840 --> 03:30:45.590 align:start position:0%
with consequences and no options for
recourse

03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
recourse
 
03:30:47.349 --> 03:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
and we've already heard testimony about
 
03:30:49.110 --> 03:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
how recourse is
 
03:30:53.670 --> 03:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:56.070 --> 03:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
as previously testified and i do hate to
 
03:30:59.429 --> 03:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
repeat this but it is about this bill
 
03:31:01.269 --> 03:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
no evidence or witness testimony was
 
03:31:01.279 --> 03:31:02.710 align:start position:0%
no evidence or witness testimony was
permitted

03:31:02.710 --> 03:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
in post-divorce proceedings again this
 
03:31:06.550 --> 03:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
is a post-divorce proceeding that should
 
03:31:09.030 --> 03:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
have never happened
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
all life history
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
was eliminated
 
03:31:16.870 --> 03:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
you can't bring in any facts you get
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
nothing you get zero
 
03:31:22.389 --> 03:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
without the ability to submit evidence
 
03:31:25.349 --> 03:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
or history and orders victims
 
03:31:27.670 --> 03:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
to be legally bound to their abusers
 
03:31:30.150 --> 03:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
without due process and in my case there
 
03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
was abuse it is well documented there is
 
03:31:35.349 --> 03:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
criminal records
 
03:31:38.070 --> 03:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
furthermore this failure of due process
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
opens the door for coercion slander
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
allegations gaslighting corruption
 
03:31:42.399 --> 03:31:44.070 align:start position:0%
allegations gaslighting corruption
moreover

03:31:44.070 --> 03:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
moreover
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
and more
 
03:31:48.790 --> 03:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
i feel like you could almost call it
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
court facilitated abuse
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
but the question is why
 
03:31:55.349 --> 03:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
why is that allowed that's why we're
 
03:31:57.510 --> 03:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
here today is to look at the laws look
 
03:31:59.110 --> 03:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
at the facts look at what is not as
 
03:32:01.750 --> 03:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
working there is a pattern it is not
 
03:32:03.750 --> 03:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
just in the state of new hampshire
 
03:32:05.349 --> 03:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
this is across the united states of
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
america there is about three states that
 
03:32:09.990 --> 03:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
do not have this problem
 
03:32:11.670 --> 03:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
all other states do
 
03:32:11.680 --> 03:32:13.510 align:start position:0%
all other states do
henceforth

03:32:13.510 --> 03:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
henceforth
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
i have already commended the governor
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
for signing
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
the proclamation for the family court
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
awareness month which again has embedded
 
03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
in it
 
03:32:24.870 --> 03:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
supporting facts and evidence that this
 
03:32:33.910 --> 03:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:35.429 --> 03:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
i think i'll end on that because i know
 
03:32:37.510 --> 03:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
that there's other testimony
 
03:32:39.510 --> 03:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:32:43.510 --> 03:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:46.469 --> 03:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
03:32:52.229 --> 03:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:56.469 --> 03:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:58.950 --> 03:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes
 
03:33:02.229 --> 03:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what said that's correct yes
 
03:33:05.670 --> 03:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you for hearing me again
 
03:33:05.680 --> 03:33:07.750 align:start position:0%
and thank you for hearing me again
um

03:33:07.750 --> 03:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
i am testifying in support of this bill
 
03:33:13.990 --> 03:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of the judiciary is to
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
look at the facts
 
03:33:17.830 --> 03:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
and apply those facts to the law then
 
03:33:19.590 --> 03:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
issue orders and concurrence with the
 
03:33:21.990 --> 03:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
law how is the judiciary supposed to
 
03:33:24.790 --> 03:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
ethically do so if the parties do not
 
03:33:26.550 --> 03:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
have the right to submit evidence to
 
03:33:28.070 --> 03:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
support their claims
 
03:33:29.910 --> 03:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
if a judge is permitted to look at one
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
of the parting parties and say no i'm
 
03:33:35.110 --> 03:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
not accepting your evidence it creates a
 
03:33:38.309 --> 03:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
bias to the entire proceedings
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
i've witnessed the judicial referee
 
03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
tell my husband that she would not
 
03:33:45.030 --> 03:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
accept evidence that he had that his
 
03:33:47.990 --> 03:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
oldest child graduated high school that
 
03:33:50.309 --> 03:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
evidence was public
 
03:33:53.670 --> 03:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
when they post the graduates
 
03:33:56.389 --> 03:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
in the public in the newspaper instead
 
03:33:58.389 --> 03:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
she took the mother's word that even
 
03:34:00.389 --> 03:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
though he was almost 19
 
03:34:02.070 --> 03:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
he was still enrolled
 
03:34:03.670 --> 03:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
this led to my husband paid child
 
03:34:05.670 --> 03:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
support for a year longer than the
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements because i think
 
03:34:09.030 --> 03:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
it was like
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh a month into the hearings when he
 
03:34:13.190 --> 03:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
first filed that the child actually
 
03:34:15.030 --> 03:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
turned at 19.
 
03:34:17.190 --> 03:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
i witnessed the judge refused my husband
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
evidence that the mother forged a
 
03:34:21.429 --> 03:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
paternity test to make it look like he
 
03:34:23.990 --> 03:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
was not the father of his youngest he
 
03:34:26.309 --> 03:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
has with her that evidence was from in
 
03:34:28.150 --> 03:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
the form of a police report where she
 
03:34:30.630 --> 03:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
confessed to the officer that she forged
 
03:34:33.990 --> 03:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
the test to alienate him from his
 
03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:34.950 align:start position:0%
the test to alienate him from his
daughter

03:34:34.950 --> 03:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
03:34:36.550 --> 03:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
i've witnessed the judge refused my
 
03:34:38.070 --> 03:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
husband's evidence that the mother of
 
03:34:40.469 --> 03:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
his daughters lied to a mental health
 
03:34:42.309 --> 03:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
provider by claiming that there was a
 
03:34:44.070 --> 03:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
restraining order in place for the
 
03:34:45.750 --> 03:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of preventing him from taking
 
03:34:47.830 --> 03:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
part in the children's therapy that
 
03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
evidence was in the form of the
 
03:34:51.190 --> 03:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
children's mental health records
 
03:34:52.950 --> 03:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
i've witnessed the judge refused my
 
03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
husband evidence that she lied to the
 
03:34:56.870 --> 03:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
court the mother and a financial
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
affidavit and did not disclose that she
 
03:35:01.830 --> 03:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
was receiving tanf benefits for the
 
03:35:01.840 --> 03:35:02.790 align:start position:0%
was receiving tanf benefits for the
children

03:35:02.790 --> 03:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
that evidence was in the form of a
 
03:35:06.870 --> 03:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
letter directly from the department of
 
03:35:09.110 --> 03:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
health and human services that confirmed
 
03:35:10.630 --> 03:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
that the children were receiving the
 
03:35:13.190 --> 03:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
benefit and as well as the date that
 
03:35:15.429 --> 03:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
they started receiving the benefit
 
03:35:16.870 --> 03:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
i've witnessed the judge refused my
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
husband's evidence that the children's
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
maternal grandfather threatened to pack
 
03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
up his daughter and her children and
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
leave the states so he would never see
 
03:35:26.870 --> 03:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
them again and there would be nothing he
 
03:35:28.950 --> 03:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
could do about it that evidence was in
 
03:35:31.030 --> 03:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
the form of a recording of the voicemail
 
03:35:33.190 --> 03:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
he left a threat on my husband was
 
03:35:36.150 --> 03:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
trying to obtain an ex parte order to
 
03:35:39.510 --> 03:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
prevent the threatened kidnapping
 
03:35:41.830 --> 03:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
in one of my husband's older case files
 
03:35:44.630 --> 03:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
where the judge refused his evidence
 
03:35:48.469 --> 03:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
that the dcyf worker caseworker never
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
attempted to contact him before she
 
03:35:52.870 --> 03:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
initiated court proceedings she
 
03:35:54.950 --> 03:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
testified that she tried to contact him
 
03:35:58.150 --> 03:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
by phone his evidence was his certified
 
03:35:59.910 --> 03:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
phone records
 
03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
proving that she lied
 
03:36:05.110 --> 03:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
he said i wasn't going to take it and he
 
03:36:07.349 --> 03:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
had to deal with over a year of jumping
 
03:36:10.150 --> 03:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
through dcyf hoops to get access to his
 
03:36:11.750 --> 03:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
children back
 
03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
when a judge refuses to accept evidence
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
then on the record all they have to base
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
the decision on is one party's word
 
03:36:21.670 --> 03:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
against the other that allows them to
 
03:36:23.750 --> 03:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
claim that one party was more credible
 
03:36:25.990 --> 03:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
than the other and pick and choose how
 
03:36:27.670 --> 03:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
they will issue orders based on their
 
03:36:30.469 --> 03:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
own personal personal biases because
 
03:36:32.790 --> 03:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
according to and the family courts don't
 
03:36:34.870 --> 03:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
have evidentiary rules but the superior
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
court does and in superior court
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
evidentiary rules physical evidence has
 
03:36:41.590 --> 03:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
a higher weight that they have to look
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
at than just testimony so when you
 
03:36:46.710 --> 03:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
eliminate physical evidence now you just
 
03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
have the testimony and they can say well
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know i kind of like the way that
 
03:36:53.429 --> 03:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
that person looks better i think that
 
03:36:55.830 --> 03:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
they look like they wouldn't lie to me
 
03:36:55.840 --> 03:36:56.950 align:start position:0%
they look like they wouldn't lie to me
um

03:36:56.950 --> 03:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:59.990 --> 03:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
so it enforces their personal biases and
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
it oftentimes leads to orders that are
 
03:37:03.750 --> 03:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
not in the best interest of the children
 
03:37:05.750 --> 03:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:37:09.269 --> 03:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
representative alterla
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:37:16.389 --> 03:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
is this working yes yeah okay thank you
 
03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much for your testimony
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
today and um and all of the testimony
 
03:37:22.309 --> 03:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
you've presented throughout the day um
 
03:37:23.670 --> 03:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
just so
 
03:37:25.830 --> 03:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
i can wrap my head around the
 
03:37:29.670 --> 03:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
mechanics of how this is playing out um
 
03:37:31.750 --> 03:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds like
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'll ask just about your case
 
03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
specifically are there ones that you
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
have first-hand knowledge of
 
03:37:39.429 --> 03:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
what does it look like
 
03:37:42.070 --> 03:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
and what is the occasion
 
03:37:45.349 --> 03:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
that a judge that there's
 
03:37:47.990 --> 03:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
evidence to be presented
 
03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:49.110 align:start position:0%
evidence to be presented
and

03:37:49.110 --> 03:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:51.190 --> 03:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
the judge refuses
 
03:37:54.790 --> 03:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
is it during the course of
 
03:37:54.800 --> 03:37:55.510 align:start position:0%
is it during the course of
a

03:37:55.510 --> 03:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:37:59.510 --> 03:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
case review or it's during the course
 
03:38:01.269 --> 03:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
so basically what happens is you will
 
03:38:02.710 --> 03:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
file a motion
 
03:38:02.720 --> 03:38:03.750 align:start position:0%
file a motion
um

03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:06.150 --> 03:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
you are not you don't file exhibits with
 
03:38:07.349 --> 03:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
you submit exhibits when you go into
 
03:38:09.920 --> 03:38:10.950 align:start position:0%
you submit exhibits when you go into
hearing

03:38:10.950 --> 03:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:38:13.349 --> 03:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
so when you go into hearing
 
03:38:13.359 --> 03:38:14.950 align:start position:0%
so when you go into hearing
um

03:38:14.950 --> 03:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know a professional currency you
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
give the other party you know your
 
03:38:20.229 --> 03:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
evidence beforehand but you don't have
 
03:38:22.870 --> 03:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
to do that with family court um you
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
could just show up with whatever so what
 
03:38:27.189 --> 03:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
it looks like is you go
 
03:38:27.199 --> 03:38:28.389 align:start position:0%
it looks like is you go
um

03:38:28.389 --> 03:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:31.510 --> 03:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
my claims are supported in paragraph
 
03:38:34.790 --> 03:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
one two and three of my motion um by
 
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
these exhibits and the judge looks at
 
03:38:39.990 --> 03:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
the bailiff and he says bailiff um can
 
03:38:45.670 --> 03:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what it looks like and
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
then there's no reference to them in any
 
03:38:52.389 --> 03:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
orders and they are not even in the case
 
03:38:55.670 --> 03:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
file when you go to take the case file
 
03:38:57.750 --> 03:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
for demonstrating how that how that what
 
03:39:03.349 --> 03:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
that experience is like and um yeah it's
 
03:39:05.750 --> 03:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
very disheartening um especially when
 
03:39:07.590 --> 03:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
you're submitting evidence
 
03:39:07.600 --> 03:39:08.389 align:start position:0%
you're submitting evidence
that

03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:09.750 --> 03:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
like i said family courts don't have
 
03:39:11.429 --> 03:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
rule of evidence but the superior court
 
03:39:11.439 --> 03:39:12.229 align:start position:0%
rule of evidence but the superior court
does

03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:39:13.590 --> 03:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
in my husband's cases he made sure that
 
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
everything would at least be
 
03:39:18.960 --> 03:39:20.070 align:start position:0%
everything would at least be
submittable

03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
submittable
 
03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
by because you have to make sure you're
 
03:39:24.309 --> 03:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
submitting credible evidence um so when
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
a judge is looking at a police report
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
proving that the mother is actively
 
03:39:31.110 --> 03:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
alienating the child to the point where
 
03:39:33.830 --> 03:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
she forged a medical document
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
and she admitted that to police
 
03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
and the judge is
 
03:39:41.670 --> 03:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't even want to hear it when
 
03:39:44.229 --> 03:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
the action in front of the judge is to
 
03:39:46.550 --> 03:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
restrict her decision-making because
 
03:39:48.710 --> 03:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
she's not able to make good decisions
 
03:39:51.429 --> 03:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
for the children you know it's very very
 
03:39:51.439 --> 03:39:54.070 align:start position:0%
for the children you know it's very very
disheartening

03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
disheartening
 
03:39:55.910 --> 03:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:39:57.269 --> 03:39:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:39:59.030 --> 03:39:59.040 align:start position:0%

03:39:59.040 --> 03:40:00.150 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair thank you man for

03:44:03.030 --> 03:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
that the gal catherine schoenenberg and
 
03:44:05.110 --> 03:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
opposing council mentioned
 
03:44:07.269 --> 03:44:07.279 align:start position:0%

teacher spoke to my ex and i followed up
 
03:44:17.349 --> 03:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
with an email to the teacher
 
03:44:19.189 --> 03:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
then the fifth grade teacher changed his
 
03:44:21.269 --> 03:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
story what happened in my case is
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
everyone involved had a different story
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%

03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
so nobody agreed with what the fifth
 
03:44:37.750 --> 03:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
grade teacher
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
was saying he didn't come to court to
 
03:44:44.469 --> 03:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
testify that would have been nice
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me regarding my daughter's
 
03:44:49.110 --> 03:44:49.120 align:start position:0%

03:44:58.150 --> 03:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
or her concerns or her recommendation
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
on that bill summary it reflected phone
 
03:45:01.750 --> 03:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
calls primarily
 
03:45:02.790 --> 03:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
conflicting hearsay evidence and i'm
 
03:45:06.790 --> 03:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
just hoping that we can fix that with
 
03:45:08.070 --> 03:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:45:09.750 --> 03:45:09.760 align:start position:0%

03:46:10.630 --> 03:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
premature recommendation without
 
03:46:12.870 --> 03:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
completing her investigation
 
03:46:14.469 --> 03:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
another collateral
 
03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
resource that kathleen failed to reach
 
03:46:18.870 --> 03:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
out to was my therapist of many years
 
03:46:21.030 --> 03:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
that i signed a release for catherine
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
and for my therapist
 
03:46:24.469 --> 03:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
speaking with
 
03:46:26.229 --> 03:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
my therapist would have been beneficial
 
03:46:28.950 --> 03:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
when making assumptions as kathleen had
 
03:46:30.070 --> 03:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
about me
 
03:46:31.830 --> 03:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
kathleen sternburn only reached out to
 
03:46:33.030 --> 03:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
my therapist
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
after the status hearing in her
 
03:46:37.269 --> 03:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation to remove my child
 
03:46:39.670 --> 03:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
there were allegations made to dcyf in
 
03:46:41.269 --> 03:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
march of 2020
 
03:46:43.429 --> 03:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
that were unfounded kathleen sternenberg
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
never pulled the final report from dcuf
 
03:46:47.910 --> 03:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
to review it was alleged i was doing
 
03:46:50.550 --> 03:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
drugs in her report i voluntarily took a
 
03:46:52.070 --> 03:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
hair follicles
 
03:46:55.189 --> 03:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
test which was negative to refute
 
03:46:56.790 --> 03:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
the allegations of drug use in
 
03:46:59.189 --> 03:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
kathleen's report there was no evidence
 
03:47:01.269 --> 03:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
submitted in the form of police reports
 
03:47:03.349 --> 03:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
or other information in support of any
 
03:47:05.590 --> 03:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
danger to my daughter that would justify
 
03:47:08.150 --> 03:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
kathleen sterling bird's recommendation
 
03:47:09.910 --> 03:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
in all my years i have never been
 
03:47:09.920 --> 03:47:11.349 align:start position:0%
in all my years i have never been
convicted

03:47:11.349 --> 03:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
convicted
 
03:47:12.710 --> 03:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
of any crime
 
03:47:15.189 --> 03:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
or had any calls made on me to dcyf
 
03:47:17.510 --> 03:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
meanwhile my ex had three duis that
 
03:47:20.150 --> 03:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't a concern to her the court took
 
03:47:22.710 --> 03:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
kathleen's recommendation
 
03:47:24.630 --> 03:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
on a 20-minute status hearing through
 
03:47:26.790 --> 03:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
webex prior to our final hearing which
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
was scheduled for january 28 2021
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
so they completely ignored the evidence
 
03:47:35.510 --> 03:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
i submitted to rebut false allegations
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
of drug use but took kathleen starring
 
03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
sterling birds made up claims instead
 
03:47:43.189 --> 03:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
after the temporary hearing was granted
 
03:47:45.750 --> 03:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
from the status hearing in november 2020
 
03:47:48.150 --> 03:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
i submitted a couple videos to kathleen
 
03:47:50.710 --> 03:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
that my daughter sent me dated one was 6
 
03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
1 2009 stating help me
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
this was four months prior to my ex
 
03:47:58.630 --> 03:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
motioning the court for custody
 
03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
this video is alarming along with other
 
03:48:03.590 --> 03:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
recordings of my daughter talking
 
03:48:05.510 --> 03:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
about her stepmother hitting her and
 
03:48:07.030 --> 03:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
other alarming information that would
 
03:48:08.870 --> 03:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully make kathleen look at things a
 
03:48:10.469 --> 03:48:10.479 align:start position:0%
little bit closer
 
03:48:12.309 --> 03:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
this didn't change her recommendation at
 
03:48:15.110 --> 03:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
the final hearing it was discredited and
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
never did she ever mention it in her
 
03:48:18.870 --> 03:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
final report even though i addressed
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
these concerns on my first interview
 
03:48:25.429 --> 03:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
and in my questionnaire
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
and didn't think i would have to send i
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
didn't think i would have to send the
 
03:48:31.030 --> 03:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
videos however she did bill for the time
 
03:48:33.189 --> 03:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
to review them
 
03:48:36.150 --> 03:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
um again more evidence that was simply
 
03:48:38.710 --> 03:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
disregarded i also provided multiple
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
text messages between my daughter and
 
03:48:42.790 --> 03:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
myself prior to court to demonstrate the
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
relationship we had
 
03:48:47.349 --> 03:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
texas between my daughter's therapist
 
03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
and myself about the video helped me
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned above text message documenting
 
03:48:54.550 --> 03:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
my daughter was not happy with her
 
03:48:57.189 --> 03:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
father and stepmom and clearly
 
03:48:58.950 --> 03:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't mature to have a say in this
 
03:49:00.389 --> 03:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
final decision
 
03:49:00.399 --> 03:49:01.590 align:start position:0%
final decision
but

03:49:01.590 --> 03:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
all that was just ignored so i just
 
03:49:06.110 --> 03:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
so i support bill
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
hb1142 because the court didn't look at
 
03:49:10.710 --> 03:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
the evidence i gave them and just took
 
03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:19.110 --> 03:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you any any questions
 
03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:22.960 align:start position:0%

03:49:35.830 --> 03:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
in relevance to this and your guardian
 
03:49:38.630 --> 03:49:38.640 align:start position:0%

03:49:40.870 --> 03:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
that had a conflict of interest
 
03:49:43.510 --> 03:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
no i have i what i have heard today is
 
03:49:46.630 --> 03:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
the last marital master um thomas cooper
 
03:49:48.630 --> 03:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:49.750 --> 03:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:53.349 --> 03:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:07.590 --> 03:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair committee members
 
03:50:10.790 --> 03:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh for the record eric brand
 
03:50:12.389 --> 03:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
i'm from nashua
 
03:50:12.399 --> 03:50:13.429 align:start position:0%
i'm from nashua
um

03:50:13.429 --> 03:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:20.070 --> 03:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:22.229 --> 03:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
is a perfect example of why previous
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill number 1265 is so important because
 
03:50:26.710 --> 03:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
these judges tend to
 
03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
take uh and make their own rules so this
 
03:50:31.349 --> 03:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
is just another great example of this
 
03:50:32.790 --> 03:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna give you a story which i
 
03:50:34.550 --> 03:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to share yet with this
 
03:50:36.790 --> 03:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
committee and other testimonies
 
03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
five minutes prior to my temporary
 
03:50:38.640 --> 03:50:39.750 align:start position:0%
five minutes prior to my temporary
hearing

03:50:39.750 --> 03:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:50:42.790 --> 03:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
the opposing attorney brought in
 
03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
a motion to the judge asking that i
 
03:50:48.870 --> 03:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
basically wipe out my entire life
 
03:50:50.469 --> 03:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
savings from my
 
03:50:53.830 --> 03:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
deferred tax account and pay it to the
 
03:50:56.309 --> 03:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
other opposing party
 
03:50:58.150 --> 03:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
there was no hearing no evidence
 
03:51:01.189 --> 03:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
provided at that particular time
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
there was an order that was given with
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
the rest of the
 
03:51:06.309 --> 03:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
um temporary orders
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
to pay the pay
 
03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
the opposing party the balance of the
 
03:51:12.389 --> 03:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
tax offer to count all penalties and tax
 
03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
liabilities within five days
 
03:51:17.110 --> 03:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
meanwhile we never had a chance to
 
03:51:18.630 --> 03:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
provide evidence
 
03:51:20.550 --> 03:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
or to show anything during that
 
03:51:22.950 --> 03:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
temporary hearing let alone having that
 
03:51:25.030 --> 03:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
motion given to us prior to the hearing
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
with enough time to prepare for it
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
so once we receive the order we'd filed
 
03:51:32.229 --> 03:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
a motion to reconsider
 
03:51:33.910 --> 03:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
my attorney used many laws that were
 
03:51:37.110 --> 03:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:39.269 --> 03:51:39.279 align:start position:0%
that motion to reconsider was denied and
 
03:51:41.189 --> 03:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
there was threaten of incarceration to
 
03:51:41.199 --> 03:51:43.990 align:start position:0%
there was threaten of incarceration to
myself

03:51:43.990 --> 03:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
myself
 
03:51:45.910 --> 03:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
we then filed a motion to stay on the
 
03:51:49.030 --> 03:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
payment requested a hearing
 
03:51:50.710 --> 03:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
eventually five months later we had this
 
03:51:50.720 --> 03:51:51.990 align:start position:0%
eventually five months later we had this
hearing

03:51:51.990 --> 03:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:51:53.910 --> 03:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
we provided evidence
 
03:51:56.229 --> 03:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
in over 500 checks
 
03:51:58.710 --> 03:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
in account statements to show
 
03:52:01.590 --> 03:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
where prior funds had been used
 
03:52:03.590 --> 03:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
these the evidence that we provided was
 
03:52:05.750 --> 03:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
uncontested at the time by the opposing
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
party or the judge
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
and that was all based on money that was
 
03:52:09.840 --> 03:52:10.790 align:start position:0%
and that was all based on money that was
spent

03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
spent
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
before the actual divorce proceedings
 
03:52:16.269 --> 03:52:16.279 align:start position:0%
started and but prior to the anti
 
03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:24.070 --> 03:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
after the hearing
 
03:52:26.309 --> 03:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
we finally received the orders the
 
03:52:28.229 --> 03:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
orders continued to say
 
03:52:31.670 --> 03:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
pay the balance of the funds the fines
 
03:52:34.950 --> 03:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
the taxes and now attorney fees
 
03:52:37.189 --> 03:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
and additional fines
 
03:52:38.710 --> 03:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
and then there was continued threats of
 
03:52:44.469 --> 03:52:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:46.630 --> 03:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
the judge's answer this was former judge
 
03:52:49.590 --> 03:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
intracaso as to why i had to pay it
 
03:52:51.590 --> 03:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with the evidence that
 
03:52:53.349 --> 03:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
was provided
 
03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
she said
 
03:52:55.990 --> 03:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
you're paying it because i ordered you
 
03:52:56.000 --> 03:52:58.309 align:start position:0%
you're paying it because i ordered you
two

03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:00.950 --> 03:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
this bill demands the court to listen to
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
both parties and make rulings that are
 
03:53:12.790 --> 03:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:14.550 --> 03:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
without this bill
 
03:53:17.189 --> 03:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
and hb 1265 we're leaving all this
 
03:53:19.030 --> 03:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
discretion up to the judges
 
03:53:20.790 --> 03:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
that could have a biased opinion against
 
03:53:20.800 --> 03:53:22.389 align:start position:0%
that could have a biased opinion against
somebody

03:53:22.389 --> 03:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
03:53:25.030 --> 03:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
and it's just leaving way too much in
 
03:53:26.309 --> 03:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
the hands of somebody else to make
 
03:53:28.229 --> 03:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
decisions and taking away from our civil
 
03:53:28.239 --> 03:53:29.990 align:start position:0%
decisions and taking away from our civil
rights

03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
rights
 
03:53:30.000 --> 03:53:32.150 align:start position:0%
rights
both

03:53:32.150 --> 03:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
both
 
03:53:34.469 --> 03:53:34.479 align:start position:0%
we we heard earlier today and i'll quote
 
03:53:37.510 --> 03:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
the judges rely on evidence provided
 
03:53:39.910 --> 03:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
i wasn't allowed evidence to be provided
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
and ruled upon within my case
 
03:53:46.710 --> 03:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
both bill 1265 and
 
03:53:51.510 --> 03:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
1142 are being proposed to stop this
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
bias judgment ensure all parties are
 
03:53:55.670 --> 03:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
getting a fair hearing
 
03:53:57.670 --> 03:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
and to ensure ensure their civil rights
 
03:53:59.349 --> 03:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
are left intact
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people's lives here
 
03:54:02.870 --> 03:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
in the lives of their children and how
 
03:54:04.550 --> 03:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're being affected
 
03:54:08.950 --> 03:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:13.750 --> 03:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:22.630 --> 03:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
next i'd like to call uh dina albrecht
 
03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:32.389 --> 03:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
thank you i just want to say i support
 
03:54:35.349 --> 03:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill but i fully
 
03:54:38.229 --> 03:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
respect mr head's concerns just want to
 
03:54:41.590 --> 03:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
say that almost all police reports
 
03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
entered into evidence in my case were
 
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
completely ignored in so far as
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
substantial testimony about them was
 
03:54:52.469 --> 03:54:52.479 align:start position:0%
never mentioned in any narrative order
 
03:54:55.830 --> 03:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
so i just ask how we can
 
03:54:58.950 --> 03:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
maybe craft something via amendment that
 
03:55:01.990 --> 03:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
addresses both the concerns
 
03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:02.950 align:start position:0%
addresses both the concerns
of

03:55:02.950 --> 03:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:55:04.870 --> 03:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
all of the aggrieved parties here in
 
03:55:06.389 --> 03:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
family court
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh as well as the concerns of the
 
03:55:10.870 --> 03:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
03:55:12.389 --> 03:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't think we want to get rid
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
of like legitimate motions in lemonade
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
or something like that so i'd really
 
03:55:19.349 --> 03:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
like to see something that addresses the
 
03:55:22.469 --> 03:55:22.479 align:start position:0%
issue and maybe we just fix the language
 
03:55:23.670 --> 03:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:30.309 --> 03:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:45.590 --> 03:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
i might actually only need like 30
 
03:55:45.600 --> 03:55:46.550 align:start position:0%
i might actually only need like 30
seconds

03:55:46.550 --> 03:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
03:55:46.560 --> 03:55:48.150 align:start position:0%
seconds
um

03:55:48.150 --> 03:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
madame chairwoman and members of the
 
03:55:49.680 --> 03:55:50.550 align:start position:0%
madame chairwoman and members of the
children

03:55:50.550 --> 03:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:55:52.630 --> 03:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
and family law committee
 
03:55:55.110 --> 03:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
in my case judge and dicasso refused to
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
allow me to submit evidence in the
 
03:55:56.880 --> 03:55:58.870 align:start position:0%
allow me to submit evidence in the
hearing

03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
and didn't admit
 
03:56:03.030 --> 03:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
it on record at all i want to be clear
 
03:56:06.550 --> 03:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
that she did not even tell me why
 
03:56:09.030 --> 03:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's not like my ex's attorney even
 
03:56:11.910 --> 03:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
asked judge intercasso to exclude it by
 
03:56:13.670 --> 03:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
filing a motion
 
03:56:15.750 --> 03:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
my entire divorce
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
would have ended up completely different
 
03:56:21.269 --> 03:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
if the judge just took in my evidence
 
03:56:22.309 --> 03:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%

03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
time i'm going to ask you a question
 
03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
that i asked a previous witness
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
what did that look like at the time you
 
03:56:44.630 --> 03:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
showed up in the room you had paper
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
how did you
 
03:56:47.750 --> 03:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
like how did it play out that's what i
 
03:56:49.750 --> 03:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
want to yep i want to see it if you
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
don't mind yup thank you so at the time
 
03:56:55.189 --> 03:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
that i was in court my ex's attorney
 
03:56:57.750 --> 03:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
gave in their package and they started
 
03:56:57.760 --> 03:56:59.110 align:start position:0%
gave in their package and they started
um

03:56:59.110 --> 03:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:01.269 --> 03:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
going through my employment
 
03:57:04.389 --> 03:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
and she asked if if i had seeked any
 
03:57:04.399 --> 03:57:05.510 align:start position:0%
and she asked if if i had seeked any
employment

03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
employment
 
03:57:07.990 --> 03:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
and my attorney turned around and said
 
03:57:10.070 --> 03:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
i don't have it in my hand but i can get
 
03:57:13.030 --> 03:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
it to you she says nope
 
03:57:13.040 --> 03:57:13.990 align:start position:0%
it to you she says nope
and

03:57:13.990 --> 03:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
not only did she
 
03:57:18.150 --> 03:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
not look at that
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
that actually was the whole reason why
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
she took child support away from me
 
03:57:26.309 --> 03:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
um i had a work log i also own a bed and
 
03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
breakfast she told me that my
 
03:57:29.040 --> 03:57:31.269 align:start position:0%
breakfast she told me that my
hobby

03:57:31.269 --> 03:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
hobby
 
03:57:34.469 --> 03:57:34.479 align:start position:0%
needed to be shut down within six months
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
and and said i'm glad you're trying to
 
03:57:37.349 --> 03:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
live the all-american dream but go out
 
03:57:39.830 --> 03:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
and get a real job but what she also
 
03:57:42.389 --> 03:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
didn't look at which i tried to submit
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
was the fact that my income dropped
 
03:57:46.950 --> 03:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
more than half
 
03:57:49.269 --> 03:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
because my ex at the time
 
03:57:51.750 --> 03:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
took my facebook my instagram my booking
 
03:57:54.790 --> 03:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
engine my website shut everything down
 
03:57:56.389 --> 03:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
because he was the one that started to
 
03:57:57.429 --> 03:57:57.439 align:start position:0%
get it
 
03:58:00.150 --> 03:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
going he was the technical guru
 
03:58:02.229 --> 03:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
he set up the websites and all these
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
accounts he had all the passwords he had
 
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
tucked his email behind so when i tried
 
03:58:11.670 --> 03:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
to go in and re-change the password
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
it went back to him as a
 
03:58:16.710 --> 03:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
hey your password was changed
 
03:58:19.110 --> 03:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
i didn't know anything about the
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
technical parts of this because that was
 
03:58:22.389 --> 03:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
his specialty
 
03:58:24.790 --> 03:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
i had an email from
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
um one of the um
 
03:58:29.590 --> 03:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
the accounts that i was trying to get
 
03:58:29.600 --> 03:58:30.950 align:start position:0%
the accounts that i was trying to get
reestablished

03:58:30.950 --> 03:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
reestablished
 
03:58:32.950 --> 03:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
and they acknowledged that it was shut
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
down by mr silva
 
03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
and that alone
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
would have showed the judge
 
03:58:38.880 --> 03:58:39.990 align:start position:0%
would have showed the judge
that

03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
my income was affected which made it
 
03:58:45.189 --> 03:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
look like a hobby because
 
03:58:47.670 --> 03:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
he tampered with my
 
03:58:47.680 --> 03:58:48.950 align:start position:0%
he tampered with my
accounts

03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
03:58:50.790 --> 03:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
until this day if you look at how much
 
03:58:52.229 --> 03:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
money i make
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's probably
 
03:58:56.710 --> 03:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
triple of what it was back at the very
 
03:58:58.950 --> 03:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
beginning of the divorce so as soon as i
 
03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
re-established those accounts but it
 
03:59:02.710 --> 03:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
took me a year i had to have court
 
03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
documents to say that i was awarded the
 
03:59:07.590 --> 03:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
business i had to show all my um
 
03:59:11.030 --> 03:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
my my passports i had to show my my um
 
03:59:13.750 --> 03:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
operation operating plan i had to sh i
 
03:59:16.229 --> 03:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
had to prove to them that this business
 
03:59:18.469 --> 03:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
was only established by me
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
we bought the property together but the
 
03:59:23.910 --> 03:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
business was 100 mine he had no
 
03:59:27.349 --> 03:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
involvement whatsoever so by not proven
 
03:59:28.630 --> 03:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
to the court
 
03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
these things that has happened
 
03:59:35.030 --> 03:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
affected my child support tremendously
 
03:59:36.550 --> 03:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
and as i said i've been doing this for
 
03:59:37.990 --> 03:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
seven years
 
03:59:38.000 --> 03:59:39.670 align:start position:0%
seven years
and

03:59:39.670 --> 03:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:41.269 --> 03:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
it he shouldn't have been tampering with
 
03:59:45.269 --> 03:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:53.670 --> 03:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:00:02.229 --> 04:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
um and we have one more person to
 
04:00:05.830 --> 04:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
testify and that's gail
 
04:00:10.710 --> 04:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:12.389 --> 04:00:12.399 align:start position:0%
you did not
 
04:00:14.389 --> 04:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
specify how much time you need so i'll
 
04:00:16.150 --> 04:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
give you two minutes it'll just be very
 
04:00:17.349 --> 04:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
very brief
 
04:00:17.359 --> 04:00:19.590 align:start position:0%
very brief
um

04:00:19.590 --> 04:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:20.870 --> 04:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you again for allowing me to
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
testify before you my name is gail
 
04:00:24.870 --> 04:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
drobat for the record and i am in
 
04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
support of house bill 1142 i feel it's
 
04:00:29.830 --> 04:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
imperative that all litigants be allowed
 
04:00:31.349 --> 04:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
to submit evidence
 
04:00:33.349 --> 04:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
as this is not happening the judges are
 
04:00:34.870 --> 04:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
picking and choosing who submits
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
evidence what can be submitted to the
 
04:00:39.189 --> 04:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
extent when a litigant files
 
04:00:41.910 --> 04:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
a motion to add evidence it's denied and
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
then opposing counsel will submit
 
04:00:43.680 --> 04:00:44.950 align:start position:0%
then opposing counsel will submit
evidence

04:00:44.950 --> 04:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
04:00:47.349 --> 04:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
second day of trial can you speak into
 
04:00:47.359 --> 04:00:49.030 align:start position:0%
second day of trial can you speak into
the

04:00:49.030 --> 04:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
microphone please thank you
 
04:00:54.389 --> 04:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
do you need me to start over
 
04:00:57.830 --> 04:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:00.630 --> 04:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
the judge's um opposing counsel submits
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
evidence that is not ascended to second
 
04:01:05.510 --> 04:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
day of a final trial and leaves out a
 
04:01:07.349 --> 04:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
portion of the exhibit
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
the attorney makes material
 
04:01:11.269 --> 04:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
misrepresentations to the court
 
04:01:12.870 --> 04:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
interfering with the judicial process
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
for the judge to make a non-biased
 
04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
decision on her material
 
04:01:15.840 --> 04:01:17.590 align:start position:0%
decision on her material
misrepresentations

04:01:17.590 --> 04:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
misrepresentations
 
04:01:19.429 --> 04:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
again the judges are defying their
 
04:01:21.510 --> 04:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
judicial canons by not treating each
 
04:01:23.990 --> 04:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
litigant with respect when not being
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
represented by a member of the new
 
04:01:28.070 --> 04:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire bar
 
04:01:30.950 --> 04:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:37.590 --> 04:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much and with
 
04:01:40.229 --> 04:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
that i will close the hearing on house
 
04:01:54.309 --> 04:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
i'll now open the hearing on house bill
 
04:01:56.880 --> 04:02:00.309 align:start position:0%
i'll now open the hearing on house bill
1551.

04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:02:07.199 --> 04:02:08.070 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

04:02:08.070 --> 04:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:12.229 --> 04:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:15.110 --> 04:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
well i hope i did
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh a pink sheet
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
did everybody get that
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh that's testimony from the person
 
04:02:21.840 --> 04:02:23.590 align:start position:0%
uh that's testimony from the person
whose

04:02:23.590 --> 04:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
whose
 
04:02:23.600 --> 04:02:25.030 align:start position:0%
whose
parents

04:02:25.030 --> 04:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
parents
 
04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
entire contents of their house were
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
being delivered to her house today at 11
 
04:02:31.269 --> 04:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
or all days
 
04:02:33.030 --> 04:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
she points out
 
04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
she points out the whole point of my
 
04:02:35.279 --> 04:02:36.469 align:start position:0%
she points out the whole point of my
bill

04:02:36.469 --> 04:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:02:38.070 --> 04:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
to give justice to people who are not
 
04:02:40.319 --> 04:02:41.590 align:start position:0%
to give justice to people who are not
rich

04:02:41.590 --> 04:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
rich
 
04:02:41.600 --> 04:02:42.429 align:start position:0%
rich
it's

04:02:42.429 --> 04:02:42.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:02:45.510 --> 04:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive to have transcripts
 
04:02:49.990 --> 04:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
made the the recordings of hearings are
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
25 to 35 dollars so that's doable
 
04:02:55.590 --> 04:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
but if you get a transcript which is
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
what you need to pursue a case
 
04:02:59.120 --> 04:03:00.309 align:start position:0%
what you need to pursue a case
it's

04:03:00.309 --> 04:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:03:02.630 --> 04:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred dollars is is a drop in
 
04:03:03.750 --> 04:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
the bucket
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh she says in her testimony that she
 
04:03:09.030 --> 04:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
has spent twenty five thousand dollars
 
04:03:10.389 --> 04:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
just on
 
04:03:10.399 --> 04:03:12.070 align:start position:0%
just on
transcripts

04:03:12.070 --> 04:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
transcripts
 
04:03:12.080 --> 04:03:13.990 align:start position:0%
transcripts
um

04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:14.000 --> 04:03:15.030 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm not focusing because i'm
 
04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
thinking of so many issues that affect
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
every single one of the bills uh one is
 
04:03:24.790 --> 04:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
that these court proceedings go on and
 
04:03:28.469 --> 04:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
on and on and it's part of harassment
 
04:03:30.150 --> 04:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
because if you have enough money and
 
04:03:32.309 --> 04:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
you're mad you can just keep going back
 
04:03:34.630 --> 04:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
to court and it causes the person that
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
you're filing against to have to spend
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
money and take time away from work
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
and uh answer you so it's gets extremely
 
04:03:47.590 --> 04:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
expensive it is a method of of torture
 
04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
um so this bill simply says
 
04:03:52.870 --> 04:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
that the written transcripts
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
each party
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of this chapter
 
04:03:58.389 --> 04:03:58.399 align:start position:0%
shall have the right to create their own
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
written transcripts of the court
 
04:03:59.920 --> 04:04:01.750 align:start position:0%
written transcripts of the court
proceedings

04:04:01.750 --> 04:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
04:04:04.630 --> 04:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
and we can certainly
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
some of the other bills that we've
 
04:04:08.309 --> 04:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
talked we will be talking about about
 
04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
submitting them in appeals you know we
 
04:04:15.110 --> 04:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
can put controls in so that they have to
 
04:04:15.120 --> 04:04:16.870 align:start position:0%
can put controls in so that they have to
um

04:04:16.870 --> 04:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
they have to
 
04:04:21.750 --> 04:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
designate what time a certain thing
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
a certain
 
04:04:26.070 --> 04:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
whatever's important they have to say
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
at what
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
time and you know in the minutes what is
 
04:04:30.870 --> 04:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
the right word to say the chronological
 
04:04:33.670 --> 04:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
order of your transcript has to match
 
04:04:36.229 --> 04:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
the the official tape or
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
in the case of some other bills that
 
04:04:41.110 --> 04:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
take that the recording you made
 
04:04:43.269 --> 04:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
to be compared to the official when
 
04:04:45.030 --> 04:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
they're different
 
04:04:47.590 --> 04:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
so uh it's just a matter of money
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
because it excludes the rules that they
 
04:04:53.110 --> 04:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
are that you must buy the transcripts
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
from this one company
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
in arizona which i understand is
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
considered modest by uh new hampshire
 
04:04:59.920 --> 04:05:01.670 align:start position:0%
considered modest by uh new hampshire
standards

04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
standards
 
04:05:03.670 --> 04:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
you still have no other option
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
and if you can't come up the transcript
 
04:05:08.150 --> 04:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
your appeal
 
04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
i've seen it
 
04:05:09.359 --> 04:05:10.950 align:start position:0%
i've seen it
denied

04:05:10.950 --> 04:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
denied
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
and the weird thing is if you're a
 
04:05:12.880 --> 04:05:13.910 align:start position:0%
and the weird thing is if you're a
criminal

04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
04:05:18.630 --> 04:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
and you don't have money you are given a
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
let's see not prosecutor what you're
 
04:05:22.389 --> 04:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
given an attorney
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
but lord help you if you're just a poor
 
04:05:26.950 --> 04:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
person who's been hounded in family
 
04:05:26.960 --> 04:05:28.309 align:start position:0%
person who's been hounded in family
court

court
so

04:05:29.189 --> 04:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:05:31.510 --> 04:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
any questions from representative gay
 
04:05:35.750 --> 04:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative belanger
 
04:05:36.950 --> 04:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative k for bringing um this
 
04:05:39.199 --> 04:05:40.389 align:start position:0%
representative k for bringing um this
forward

04:05:40.389 --> 04:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:05:42.830 --> 04:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
my take is while i understand that
 
04:05:47.279 --> 04:05:49.510 align:start position:0%
my take is while i understand that
um

04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:53.110 --> 04:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
the the cost is is high perhaps maybe
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
looking at it
 
04:05:56.830 --> 04:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
and figuring out a way to make it more
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
affordable but
 
04:06:01.429 --> 04:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
i i just
 
04:06:05.110 --> 04:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
do you not see this as an issue that
 
04:06:08.229 --> 04:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
anybody can can transcribe an
 
04:06:08.239 --> 04:06:11.189 align:start position:0%
anybody can can transcribe an
interpretation

04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:13.189 --> 04:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
an interpretation
 
04:06:13.199 --> 04:06:14.950 align:start position:0%
an interpretation
of

04:06:14.950 --> 04:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:06:19.269 --> 04:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:21.189 --> 04:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
do you need to clarify well i would
 
04:06:24.870 --> 04:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
think that uh the the opposing person
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
whoever's on the other side of this
 
04:06:26.720 --> 04:06:27.670 align:start position:0%
whoever's on the other side of this
hearing

04:06:27.670 --> 04:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:06:30.229 --> 04:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
would be very happy to listen to the
 
04:06:32.950 --> 04:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
recording and to point out any
 
04:06:32.960 --> 04:06:34.790 align:start position:0%
recording and to point out any
discrepancies

04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
discrepancies
 
04:06:36.630 --> 04:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
so i really think that you're always
 
04:06:38.710 --> 04:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
going to have somebody checking
 
04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
on your work and now that we have
 
04:06:43.510 --> 04:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
software that converts spoken word to
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
written word
 
04:06:47.189 --> 04:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
it's be a lot more uh
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know you'd have to
 
04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
once you had that you'd go back and edit
 
04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
it to make sure you had paragraphs and
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
everything but i would think that the
 
04:06:55.199 --> 04:06:57.189 align:start position:0%
everything but i would think that the
opposing

04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
opposing
 
04:07:00.070 --> 04:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
party would be happy to say you didn't
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
do this right here's here's my
 
04:07:02.239 --> 04:07:06.630 align:start position:0%
do this right here's here's my
transcript

04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:08.710 --> 04:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
so then it becomes
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
answering the question so then again to
 
04:07:16.229 --> 04:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
further that issue then it becomes a he
 
04:07:18.309 --> 04:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
said she said situation and then it just
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
bounces off i think there's a i guess do
 
04:07:26.150 --> 04:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
you not see that as a problem because i
 
04:07:27.990 --> 04:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
i would rather see something along the
 
04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
lines of finding it more affordable to
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
get transcripts are you proposing an
 
04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
amendment representative no i'm trying
 
04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
to ask her if she would
 
04:07:39.910 --> 04:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
if she doesn't see that as a problem and
 
04:07:39.920 --> 04:07:40.950 align:start position:0%
if she doesn't see that as a problem and
maybe

04:07:40.950 --> 04:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:07:42.790 --> 04:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
she could come back with an amendment
 
04:07:44.550 --> 04:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you that's where i'm going with
 
04:07:44.560 --> 04:07:46.070 align:start position:0%
thank you that's where i'm going with
that

04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
well you're welcome to write an
 
04:07:49.349 --> 04:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
amendment too
 
04:07:51.990 --> 04:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
i certainly appreciate help
 
04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
one of the real serious issues
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
is that multiple people have told me
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
that when they get
 
04:08:01.199 --> 04:08:03.110 align:start position:0%
that when they get
recordings

04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
recordings
 
04:08:05.750 --> 04:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
the recordings aren't even right
 
04:08:08.309 --> 04:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about because they were
 
04:08:10.469 --> 04:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
edited as they were made
 
04:08:12.870 --> 04:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
that we talked about this last week so
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that i'm revisiting it but
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's the three issues are tied together
 
04:08:19.429 --> 04:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
making a recording
 
04:08:21.269 --> 04:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
making a transcription
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
submitting it with i have three separate
 
04:08:26.389 --> 04:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
bills so they can be all argued on their
 
04:08:28.389 --> 04:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
own behalf
 
04:08:30.790 --> 04:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
if you're what currently
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
you are stuck with the recording
 
04:08:37.110 --> 04:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
and it could be edited and we have many
 
04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
people who can testify that the
 
04:08:39.120 --> 04:08:40.630 align:start position:0%
people who can testify that the
recording

04:08:40.630 --> 04:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
recording
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
omits some really questionable things
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
that the judge or court personnel said
 
04:08:48.870 --> 04:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
so if you get the recording
 
04:08:51.269 --> 04:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
and yours is different
 
04:08:54.309 --> 04:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
we're not proposing that anybody
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
file an appeal and just use their own
 
04:09:00.630 --> 04:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
they would have to submit the official
 
04:09:03.910 --> 04:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
recording and the official transcript
 
04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
but then here's my recording and here's
 
04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
my transcript it's one of those real
 
04:09:11.189 --> 04:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
serious things that we have no proof of
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
right now until you can submit your own
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
and make your own
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
and uh it's so important that i think
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
if we do it finally
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh people who are
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
misbehaving that's the nicest word i can
 
04:09:29.030 --> 04:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
think of will know they're going to get
 
04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
caught and there ought to be teeth in it
 
04:09:33.269 --> 04:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
too you know you you're going to be
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
reviewed if you do things like this and
 
04:09:37.830 --> 04:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
and you get caught so no i didn't think
 
04:09:39.910 --> 04:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
it was simple i don't think it's easy
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
but i think it's real important to
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
address that problem
 
04:09:48.070 --> 04:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:51.349 --> 04:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
04:09:54.070 --> 04:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
next i'll call on
 
04:09:57.510 --> 04:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
richard head
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
you've asked for five minutes and we'll
 
04:10:01.510 --> 04:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
try to squeeze it down a little bit
 
04:10:01.520 --> 04:10:02.870 align:start position:0%
try to squeeze it down a little bit
please

04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
i will thank you thank you um thank you
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee my
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
name is richard head i'm the government
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
affairs coordinator for the judicial
 
04:10:10.080 --> 04:10:12.229 align:start position:0%
affairs coordinator for the judicial
branch

04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
branch
 
04:10:13.910 --> 04:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're obviously very sensitive to the
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
issue of cost
 
04:10:17.670 --> 04:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
it does cost money litigation costs
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
money transcripts are expensive and i
 
04:10:21.910 --> 04:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with that i've certainly
 
04:10:24.870 --> 04:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
represented enough clients who
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
raised concerns about the price of
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
transcripts on appeal the transcripts
 
04:10:30.319 --> 04:10:32.070 align:start position:0%
transcripts on appeal the transcripts
sorry

04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
the transcripts are a necessary element
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
of the appeal
 
04:10:36.239 --> 04:10:37.269 align:start position:0%
of the appeal
and

04:10:37.269 --> 04:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:39.750 --> 04:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
the court relies upon it and not just
 
04:10:41.670 --> 04:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
those parts that are identified in
 
04:10:44.149 --> 04:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
briefs but the whole record uh as it's
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
been submitted to the court
 
04:10:49.990 --> 04:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
this this bill as as written has no
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
it actually i'm sorry i did take a look
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
at the cost of transcripts in the other
 
04:10:55.750 --> 04:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
new england states
 
04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the cost of transcripts that new
 
04:11:01.030 --> 04:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire charges is
 
04:11:03.670 --> 04:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
almost in almost all cases lower than
 
04:11:07.830 --> 04:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
our other new england states or the same
 
04:11:09.990 --> 04:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
so we're not charging sort of an
 
04:11:11.750 --> 04:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
outrageous amount as compared to the
 
04:11:13.830 --> 04:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
other states but it is it does cost
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
money and i'm sensitive to that
 
04:11:16.319 --> 04:11:17.189 align:start position:0%
money and i'm sensitive to that
the

04:11:17.189 --> 04:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:11:19.030 --> 04:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
issue though is is really the
 
04:11:20.790 --> 04:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
reliability of that transcript because
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
that transcript does become the record
 
04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
and it does become what the judges at
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
the supreme court are ultimately looking
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
at and ruling upon
 
04:11:28.239 --> 04:11:29.189 align:start position:0%
at and ruling upon
and

04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
the current requirement does have a
 
04:11:34.070 --> 04:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
certified transcriber or a certified
 
04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:40.630 --> 04:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
that is filed with the court that is
 
04:11:42.309 --> 04:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
04:11:44.550 --> 04:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
an incredibly important part of of
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the the supreme court
 
04:11:48.790 --> 04:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
record is accurate
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
that said mistakes do happen and if
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
those are raised
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
with the court they can be addressed at
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
some level
 
04:11:57.910 --> 04:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
but as written this
 
04:12:00.070 --> 04:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
has no standards for what that
 
04:12:01.990 --> 04:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
transcript would look like it could for
 
04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
example as written this bill would allow
 
04:12:06.950 --> 04:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
for a handwritten transcript of somebody
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
who is taking notes in the back of the
 
04:12:10.950 --> 04:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
room i'm not saying that's the intent of
 
04:12:13.269 --> 04:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
of the of the sponsor
 
04:12:15.030 --> 04:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying though is as written
 
04:12:17.670 --> 04:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
this bill has absolutely no criteria or
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
standards for what it is that would be
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
submitted as a transcript um so we have
 
04:12:25.110 --> 04:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
significant concerns about about the
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
writ the bill is written
 
04:12:28.870 --> 04:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
04:12:33.670 --> 04:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.670 --> 04:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
i i should also point out there is a
 
04:12:37.189 --> 04:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
provision in the supreme court rules
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
that allows for the parties if they can
 
04:12:41.429 --> 04:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
agree understanding these are highly
 
04:12:41.439 --> 04:12:42.790 align:start position:0%
agree understanding these are highly
contentious

04:12:42.790 --> 04:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
contentious
 
04:12:45.510 --> 04:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
cases if they can agree and file a
 
04:12:47.670 --> 04:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
stipulation of the facts you don't need
 
04:12:49.349 --> 04:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
to submit a transcript you don't need to
 
04:12:51.110 --> 04:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
submit those records and essentially
 
04:12:54.070 --> 04:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's a no-cost alternative i recognize
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
the the limitations of that but i just
 
04:13:00.070 --> 04:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
representative belandra
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh i did and uh thank you mr head for
 
04:13:07.510 --> 04:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
your question uh for answering this
 
04:13:09.670 --> 04:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
question i did think of one actually
 
04:13:11.990 --> 04:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
before you take off do you know what the
 
04:13:13.590 --> 04:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
cost is
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
per transcript
 
04:13:18.070 --> 04:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
so it there's a it depends uh part of my
 
04:13:20.630 --> 04:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
answer it depends on the
 
04:13:21.990 --> 04:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
turnaround time
 
04:13:24.830 --> 04:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
so a 45 day turnaround it's
 
04:13:27.750 --> 04:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
2.75 cents a page in in new hampshire
 
04:13:29.830 --> 04:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
massachusetts it's three dollars
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
connecticut three dollars and rhode
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
island it's three to five dollars
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
but new hampshire is 2.75 cents a page
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:44.630 --> 04:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:46.630 --> 04:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:13:49.030 --> 04:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you again thank you
 
04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
next i'll call on representative kurt
 
04:13:52.080 --> 04:13:54.950 align:start position:0%
next i'll call on representative kurt
welper

04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
welper
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative you've asked for one
 
04:13:56.640 --> 04:14:02.229 align:start position:0%
representative you've asked for one
minute

04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:04.469 --> 04:14:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair yes for the
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative kurt
 
04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
welper i represent stratfor district
 
04:14:08.080 --> 04:14:09.590 align:start position:0%
welper i represent stratfor district
three

04:14:09.590 --> 04:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to clarify something
 
04:14:13.990 --> 04:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
that i heard representative gay say and
 
04:14:16.309 --> 04:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
maybe just give you just a tiny bit of
 
04:14:18.070 --> 04:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
what why
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
she's got a bill in judiciary as well
 
04:14:21.910 --> 04:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
that deals with this type of thing i'm
 
04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill
 
04:14:26.070 --> 04:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
because it allows
 
04:14:27.510 --> 04:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
the individuals to make their own
 
04:14:27.520 --> 04:14:28.870 align:start position:0%
the individuals to make their own
transcripts

04:14:28.870 --> 04:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
transcripts
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
for which they have to have their own
 
04:14:32.790 --> 04:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
recordings and part of the problem
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
with what goes on in family court is
 
04:14:36.389 --> 04:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
that the judge
 
04:14:38.790 --> 04:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
controls the recording so if the judge
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to have some stuff recorded
 
04:14:42.550 --> 04:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
the judge just presses a button
 
04:14:44.950 --> 04:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
and recording stops
 
04:14:44.960 --> 04:14:46.149 align:start position:0%
and recording stops
if

04:14:46.149 --> 04:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:14:47.990 --> 04:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
the participants were able to make their
 
04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
own recordings and make their own
 
04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
transcripts from their recordings then
 
04:14:54.309 --> 04:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
04:14:56.550 --> 04:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
a fuller record than what is often
 
04:14:59.670 --> 04:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
contained in the official transcript
 
04:14:59.680 --> 04:15:00.710 align:start position:0%
contained in the official transcript
so

04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
i think this is a
 
04:15:04.710 --> 04:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
needed check at this time
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard was that well if
 
04:15:08.950 --> 04:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
you wanted to put
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
a court stenographer in the family court
 
04:15:13.030 --> 04:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
that would solve that problem and it
 
04:15:14.790 --> 04:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
likely would but it would also cost a
 
04:15:14.800 --> 04:15:16.070 align:start position:0%
likely would but it would also cost a
bundle

04:15:16.070 --> 04:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
bundle
 
04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
so this is a way of uh handling the
 
04:15:21.189 --> 04:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
situation to provide full evidence
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
for the participants and for the courts
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
in later hearings
 
04:15:26.229 --> 04:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
i'm done
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:33.349 --> 04:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much next
 
04:15:37.269 --> 04:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
i'll call katrina henrik
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
and you've asked for three minutes
 
04:15:58.550 --> 04:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:01.030 --> 04:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay so i do have a just an example a
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
visual example this is actually a cd
 
04:16:03.359 --> 04:16:04.550 align:start position:0%
visual example this is actually a cd
recording

04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
recording
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the last hearing that i had
 
04:16:10.149 --> 04:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
this was unobtainable for me
 
04:16:11.990 --> 04:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
to get written it was going to cost me a
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a one-day trial
 
04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
there's no way
 
04:16:20.550 --> 04:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
while getting this it still needs to be
 
04:16:23.510 --> 04:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
translated in some form of print
 
04:16:25.510 --> 04:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
in order to be accepted for any court
 
04:16:25.520 --> 04:16:27.670 align:start position:0%
in order to be accepted for any court
proceedings

04:16:27.670 --> 04:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
this is important to me because on this
 
04:16:30.239 --> 04:16:31.670 align:start position:0%
this is important to me because on this
day

04:16:31.670 --> 04:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:16:33.269 --> 04:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
the guardian at latem specifically
 
04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
talked about how he was going to pass
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
this envelope that i had no right to the
 
04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
contents to
 
04:16:38.560 --> 04:16:40.469 align:start position:0%
contents to
and

04:16:40.469 --> 04:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:16:43.349 --> 04:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
that he was a gal that represented more
 
04:16:45.269 --> 04:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
men than women
 
04:16:48.149 --> 04:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
not children he represented
 
04:16:50.469 --> 04:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
over 50 percent
 
04:16:50.479 --> 04:16:51.349 align:start position:0%
over 50 percent
men

04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
men
 
04:16:54.070 --> 04:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
but he called it about equal
 
04:16:58.790 --> 04:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.149 --> 04:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
with that said
 
04:17:03.030 --> 04:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
this was a significant issue in my case
 
04:17:05.110 --> 04:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
there is inherent denial of access due
 
04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
to the extremism of the cost burden
 
04:17:09.910 --> 04:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
to the access of written or audio
 
04:17:09.920 --> 04:17:10.950 align:start position:0%
to the access of written or audio
content

04:17:10.950 --> 04:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
content
 
04:17:13.750 --> 04:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
of record of the court proceedings
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
transcription fees are technology
 
04:17:16.399 --> 04:17:17.670 align:start position:0%
transcription fees are technology
technology

04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
technology
 
04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me technologically
 
04:17:20.800 --> 04:17:22.229 align:start position:0%
excuse me technologically
unnecessary

04:17:22.229 --> 04:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
04:17:25.830 --> 04:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
with modern technology and software
 
04:17:27.590 --> 04:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
to that point the current way the court
 
04:17:30.389 --> 04:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
uses the technology to record hearings
 
04:17:32.309 --> 04:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
shows mistrust
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
as evidenced by discrepancies and family
 
04:17:36.870 --> 04:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
court records
 
04:17:38.790 --> 04:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
the importance of transcripts is
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
critical specifically when there is
 
04:17:44.229 --> 04:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
a case i intended for another family
 
04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
court litigant specifically has missing
 
04:17:51.750 --> 04:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that i witnessed by judge
 
04:17:51.760 --> 04:17:52.870 align:start position:0%
testimony that i witnessed by judge
foley

04:17:52.870 --> 04:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
foley
 
04:17:54.070 --> 04:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
who also
 
04:17:55.910 --> 04:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
was stopping and starting with clicks
 
04:18:01.110 --> 04:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:02.950 --> 04:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
this happened to be a time in the case
 
04:18:04.630 --> 04:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
where he berated
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:12.149 --> 04:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
it brings into question how the court
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
software is controlled
 
04:18:14.159 --> 04:18:15.670 align:start position:0%
software is controlled
reviewed

04:18:15.670 --> 04:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
04:18:17.510 --> 04:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
and if it's true to what actually
 
04:18:20.229 --> 04:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
occurred in the courtroom
 
04:18:22.710 --> 04:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
so a solution to me
 
04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
because we do have technology we do have
 
04:18:25.199 --> 04:18:26.550 align:start position:0%
because we do have technology we do have
software

04:18:26.550 --> 04:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
software
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
is something as simple as a travel drive
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
is very inexpensive
 
04:18:32.950 --> 04:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
each litigate can have it
 
04:18:35.990 --> 04:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
the court has a copy of its own records
 
04:18:38.070 --> 04:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
there has got to be a workable solution
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:42.800 --> 04:18:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
access

04:18:44.149 --> 04:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
access
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
to records needs to be obtainable to all
 
04:18:49.590 --> 04:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
parties so that
 
04:18:51.590 --> 04:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
personal transcribing software even
 
04:18:51.600 --> 04:18:52.710 align:start position:0%
personal transcribing software even
manual

04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
manual
 
04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
could work but i would disagree with
 
04:18:57.030 --> 04:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
that and go more with
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
a travel drive that that is that is
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:08.790 --> 04:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
discrepancy is more than just a
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
financial issue for someone like me
 
04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
that's trying to obtain the actual
 
04:19:14.630 --> 04:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
records that occurred
 
04:19:16.710 --> 04:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
but but it's also an issue of
 
04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
discrepancy of what actually occurred in
 
04:19:20.790 --> 04:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
the courtroom
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
which more often than not has showed
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
missing data on transcripts we've we've
 
04:19:25.600 --> 04:19:31.030 align:start position:0%
missing data on transcripts we've we've
obtained

04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:34.469 --> 04:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
i think this could be at least the start
 
04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
if there if there is possibly an
 
04:19:36.080 --> 04:19:39.269 align:start position:0%
if there if there is possibly an
amendment

04:19:39.269 --> 04:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:43.030 --> 04:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
to solutions that could start restoring
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
the integrity of the family court with a
 
04:19:48.389 --> 04:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
new form of checks and balances
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
and on this topic
 
04:19:51.189 --> 04:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
i thank you
 
04:19:55.030 --> 04:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:56.950 --> 04:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you will know this or
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
not but
 
04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
i could you just transcribe the
 
04:20:05.349 --> 04:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
portion that you wanted
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
or do you have to transcribe the whole
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
day the whole
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
hearing in in that particular case on
 
04:20:14.550 --> 04:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
this one that i spoke of
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
we were not sure
 
04:20:18.790 --> 04:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
what time of day it occurred so we had
 
04:20:21.510 --> 04:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
to have the entire day we had no time
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
stamp to know otherwise
 
04:20:23.520 --> 04:20:24.389 align:start position:0%
stamp to know otherwise
okay

04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:20:29.910 --> 04:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:33.750 --> 04:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.550 --> 04:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
and our final person is dana albrecht
 
04:20:43.990 --> 04:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:45.910 --> 04:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
based on prior testimony we might want
 
04:20:47.429 --> 04:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
to bump that up to one minute and i'll
 
04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
still keep it short again still dana
 
04:20:52.389 --> 04:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
albrecht just like to say in my recent
 
04:20:54.550 --> 04:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
supreme court appeal
 
04:20:57.189 --> 04:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
the official transcript from e-scribers
 
04:21:00.630 --> 04:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
left out key portions of the audio
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
causing the new hampshire supreme court
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
to order an amended transcript
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
the stuff they left out was key to the
 
04:21:12.149 --> 04:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
court's order to vacate and remand
 
04:21:14.710 --> 04:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
so i believe that's one problem
 
04:21:16.229 --> 04:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people here are trying to
 
04:21:18.870 --> 04:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
fix and i certainly support
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
fixing that
 
04:21:22.389 --> 04:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
i think another problem people here
 
04:21:25.110 --> 04:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
trying to fix is cost and i point out
 
04:21:27.750 --> 04:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
that a company like speech pad widely
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
used in the entertainment industry
 
04:21:32.790 --> 04:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
is much cheaper than a company like
 
04:21:32.800 --> 04:21:34.309 align:start position:0%
is much cheaper than a company like
escribers

04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
escribers
 
04:21:37.830 --> 04:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
widely used in the judicial system
 
04:21:37.840 --> 04:21:38.870 align:start position:0%
widely used in the judicial system
um

04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:40.710 --> 04:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
i don't want to take that too far but i
 
04:21:42.389 --> 04:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
just like to echo
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh mr head's point
 
04:21:46.950 --> 04:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
that if the parties
 
04:21:48.870 --> 04:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
in a case
 
04:21:51.830 --> 04:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh can reach some sort of stipulation
 
04:21:55.110 --> 04:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
that a transcript a far lesser cost
 
04:21:57.269 --> 04:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
that perhaps they prepared themselves
 
04:21:58.950 --> 04:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
from their own recording
 
04:22:01.110 --> 04:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
is sufficient to decide the records on
 
04:22:04.229 --> 04:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
appeal and they agree to that
 
04:22:06.389 --> 04:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
i don't see why the court shouldn't take
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
that just as a starting point to address
 
04:22:11.269 --> 04:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
some of these issues thank you happy to
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
04:22:20.950 --> 04:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
time thank you madam chair
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:25.840 --> 04:22:27.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:22:27.429 --> 04:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.870 --> 04:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.880 --> 04:22:39.429 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:22:39.429 --> 04:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
did you amendment and it takes words out
 
04:22:44.389 --> 04:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't make it longer
 
04:22:46.790 --> 04:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative gay did you pass in a
 
04:22:51.750 --> 04:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:11.910 --> 04:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:23:17.910 --> 04:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
this is very very simple we just took
 
04:23:19.510 --> 04:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
out a couple of words
 
04:23:19.520 --> 04:23:21.269 align:start position:0%
out a couple of words
twice

04:23:21.269 --> 04:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
twice
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
right now children do not have a right
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
no matter how old they are they do not
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
have a right to testify
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
and some children
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
some children are not it's not
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them to
 
04:23:33.520 --> 04:23:34.790 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them to
testify

04:23:34.790 --> 04:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
testify
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
but i've certainly met teenagers who are
 
04:23:39.269 --> 04:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
frustrated out of their mind that they
 
04:23:40.950 --> 04:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
cannot speak
 
04:23:40.960 --> 04:23:41.750 align:start position:0%
cannot speak
uh

04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
they cannot speak
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
on their
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know all these decisions that weigh
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
excess heavily on them
 
04:23:49.920 --> 04:23:51.590 align:start position:0%
excess heavily on them
so

04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:54.710 --> 04:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's why this one uh well
 
04:23:57.030 --> 04:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
i'm so sorry that i'm such a poor
 
04:23:58.710 --> 04:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
speaker so
 
04:24:00.550 --> 04:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for being patient
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 1550
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
says the court shall permit a child 12
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
years of age or older to testify orally
 
04:24:11.590 --> 04:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
at any proceeding proceeding determining
 
04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities
 
04:24:17.429 --> 04:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
and the court may permit a child
 
04:24:19.750 --> 04:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
under 12 years at the discretion of the
 
04:24:19.760 --> 04:24:20.950 align:start position:0%
under 12 years at the discretion of the
judge

04:24:20.950 --> 04:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
judge
 
04:24:22.229 --> 04:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
and we
 
04:24:24.630 --> 04:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
how we change this is he used to say the
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
child could testify
 
04:24:26.479 --> 04:24:27.590 align:start position:0%
child could testify
orally

04:24:27.590 --> 04:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
orally
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
or and um
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
the official terminology for
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
a signed statement that's witnessed
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
i can't remember adjectives but it means
 
04:24:42.149 --> 04:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's officially legal somebody's
 
04:24:44.309 --> 04:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
observed it it's not just a child write
 
04:24:45.830 --> 04:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
something and hands it in
 
04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
but after discussing this with several
 
04:24:48.000 --> 04:24:49.030 align:start position:0%
but after discussing this with several
people

04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:24:49.040 --> 04:24:49.910 align:start position:0%
people
uh

04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:49.920 --> 04:24:50.790 align:start position:0%
uh
court

04:24:50.790 --> 04:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
court experienced people said
 
04:24:56.469 --> 04:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
we'd never accept a child's submission
 
04:24:58.550 --> 04:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
of something written
 
04:25:00.309 --> 04:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
as testimony because you can't
 
04:25:02.790 --> 04:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
cross-examine them
 
04:25:04.550 --> 04:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
and we don't define
 
04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
how the judge would take the testimony
 
04:25:08.630 --> 04:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
because we figure that's the discretion
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the judge
 
04:25:11.670 --> 04:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
how to do it
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
so that's the entire
 
04:25:16.389 --> 04:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
point of this
 
04:25:19.510 --> 04:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
and there is a
 
04:25:19.520 --> 04:25:21.030 align:start position:0%
and there is a
i

04:25:21.030 --> 04:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:25:22.950 --> 04:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
hope i've passed out
 
04:25:25.110 --> 04:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
a pink sheet on this
 
04:25:27.429 --> 04:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
if i'm not i've got to go find them
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
but it's testimony from
 
04:25:31.189 --> 04:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
the mother who's
 
04:25:34.870 --> 04:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
can't show up today because of all days
 
04:25:34.880 --> 04:25:35.670 align:start position:0%
can't show up today because of all days
but

04:25:35.670 --> 04:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
she her children were desperate to be
 
04:25:38.960 --> 04:25:39.830 align:start position:0%
she her children were desperate to be
heard

04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
and they would write letters to the uh
 
04:25:45.189 --> 04:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
to the judges
 
04:25:47.670 --> 04:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
but of course the letters didn't go
 
04:25:47.680 --> 04:25:48.710 align:start position:0%
but of course the letters didn't go
anywhere

04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
04:25:48.720 --> 04:25:49.830 align:start position:0%
anywhere
so

04:25:49.830 --> 04:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking of all the kids who really
 
04:25:54.070 --> 04:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
really want to be heard
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
to give them that opportunity if they're
 
04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
12 or older
 
04:26:00.229 --> 04:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
and then if they're
 
04:26:02.309 --> 04:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
under 12 for the judge to decide whether
 
04:26:06.149 --> 04:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:09.189 --> 04:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
04:26:09.199 --> 04:26:10.710 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
yes

04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:26:10.720 --> 04:26:12.389 align:start position:0%
yes
um

04:26:12.389 --> 04:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:13.750 --> 04:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
taking my my question how was the age of
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
out of thin air
 
04:26:25.750 --> 04:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay in the past in the past i've heard
 
04:26:28.309 --> 04:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
in the in the past kids could
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
and have input and that may have been 12
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
that may have been 14. so i just took
 
04:26:35.910 --> 04:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
the the younger of the two
 
04:26:38.469 --> 04:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:26:40.950 --> 04:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:26:44.710 --> 04:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:46.229 --> 04:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
next i'll call
 
04:26:53.910 --> 04:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:55.110 --> 04:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
04:26:56.469 --> 04:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
04:26:58.070 --> 04:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
04:27:00.309 --> 04:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch the we do have
 
04:27:02.389 --> 04:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
significant concerns about this bill as
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:09.429 --> 04:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
the risk of manipulation of a 12 year
 
04:27:10.950 --> 04:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
old is immense
 
04:27:13.030 --> 04:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
requirement without any discretion on
 
04:27:17.910 --> 04:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
the part of
 
04:27:19.590 --> 04:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
of the court to
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
allow a 12 year old or older to testify
 
04:27:23.760 --> 04:27:25.510 align:start position:0%
allow a 12 year old or older to testify
creates

04:27:25.510 --> 04:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
creates
 
04:27:25.520 --> 04:27:26.630 align:start position:0%
creates
significant

04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:27:29.510 --> 04:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
risk to that to that minor
 
04:27:32.870 --> 04:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of manipulation by by apparent
 
04:27:35.189 --> 04:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
um threats that that child if you don't
 
04:27:37.830 --> 04:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
testify a certain way
 
04:27:40.870 --> 04:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know the consequences will be x uh
 
04:27:43.349 --> 04:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
to pit a 12 year old against two parents
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
to have a 12 year old cross-examined on
 
04:27:47.110 --> 04:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
the stand
 
04:27:49.349 --> 04:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
um i mean it's it's hard enough for an
 
04:27:49.359 --> 04:27:50.710 align:start position:0%
um i mean it's it's hard enough for an
adult

04:27:50.710 --> 04:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
adult
 
04:27:53.990 --> 04:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
but to have 12 13 14 15 year olds
 
04:27:54.000 --> 04:27:55.830 align:start position:0%
but to have 12 13 14 15 year olds
required

04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
required
 
04:27:58.309 --> 04:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
without any discretion of the court
 
04:27:58.319 --> 04:28:00.710 align:start position:0%
without any discretion of the court
would

04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
be potentially significantly detrimental
 
04:28:05.349 --> 04:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions but as
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
written we would oppose it
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:10.870 --> 04:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:28:12.790 --> 04:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
04:28:15.110 --> 04:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
04:28:17.349 --> 04:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
does the judge have the discretion now
 
04:28:17.359 --> 04:28:18.389 align:start position:0%
does the judge have the discretion now
to

04:28:18.389 --> 04:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
speak to the child in his uh
 
04:28:22.469 --> 04:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
what what typically happens is there
 
04:28:24.630 --> 04:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
would be a motion by a party to to allow
 
04:28:27.510 --> 04:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
that and then then the judge would uh
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
talk to the child in chambers
 
04:28:33.990 --> 04:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
so it would be a motion
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
if i may thank you so it would be
 
04:28:40.070 --> 04:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
one of the parties would be requesting
 
04:28:41.670 --> 04:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
it correct
 
04:28:44.389 --> 04:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%

04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
house bill 1550 fn requires the court to
 
04:30:37.750 --> 04:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
permit any child 12 years of age or
 
04:30:40.870 --> 04:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
older to testify orally or in writing at
 
04:30:42.630 --> 04:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
any proceeding to determine parental
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities and as we
 
04:30:47.110 --> 04:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
just heard regarding the amendment gives
 
04:30:49.830 --> 04:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
discretion to a judge to allow a child
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
under the age of 12 to testify
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
while i'm sure this bill is well
 
04:30:55.830 --> 04:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
intended this bill is problematic for
 
04:30:57.510 --> 04:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
the following reasons
 
04:30:59.349 --> 04:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
one this bill is not in the best
 
04:31:00.950 --> 04:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
interest of children
 
04:31:02.950 --> 04:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
someone testified earlier today that
 
04:31:04.710 --> 04:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
children don't deserve to be put in the
 
04:31:07.750 --> 04:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
middle but if called to testify children
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
may perceive their participation as
 
04:31:12.229 --> 04:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
forcing them to choose between their
 
04:31:14.870 --> 04:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
parents which is a harmful proposition
 
04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
in the best of circumstances
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
but consider an abuser skilled in the
 
04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
art of coercive control and manipulation
 
04:31:25.110 --> 04:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
grooming their 12 year old child to
 
04:31:27.830 --> 04:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
testify against the other parent at a
 
04:31:30.550 --> 04:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
final parenting hearing what is to stop
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
that parent from making threats for
 
04:31:35.110 --> 04:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
example to kill the child's beloved
 
04:31:38.389 --> 04:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
family pet to harm or kill the child
 
04:31:40.870 --> 04:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
or to harm or kill the child's sibling
 
04:31:43.510 --> 04:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
if they don't testify exactly how they
 
04:31:44.790 --> 04:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
want them to
 
04:31:47.670 --> 04:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
the answer is nothing will stop them
 
04:31:49.349 --> 04:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
what then happens to that child if the
 
04:31:51.429 --> 04:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
court does not rule in favor of the
 
04:31:52.950 --> 04:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
abusive parent
 
04:31:55.269 --> 04:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
that child may be susceptible to further
 
04:31:57.670 --> 04:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
abuse if their testimony just isn't
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
right in the eye of the abuser
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't shield the child from
 
04:32:01.680 --> 04:32:03.269 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't shield the child from
cross-examination

04:32:03.269 --> 04:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
cross-examination
 
04:32:05.189 --> 04:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
that means that each parent will have
 
04:32:07.910 --> 04:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
the right to question their own child on
 
04:32:11.110 --> 04:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
the stand under oath either themselves
 
04:32:13.750 --> 04:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
directly or through their attorney
 
04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't make the courtroom
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
confidential unlike child abuse and
 
04:32:18.870 --> 04:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
neglect cases
 
04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
that child will be forced to testify in
 
04:32:24.389 --> 04:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
public about their home life their
 
04:32:26.950 --> 04:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
relationship with each of their parents
 
04:32:29.110 --> 04:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
what they have witnessed and where they
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
prefer to live and with whom
 
04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
two this bill contradicts state policy
 
04:32:37.349 --> 04:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
section six page five of the parenting
 
04:32:39.910 --> 04:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
plan states each parent shall promote a
 
04:32:42.149 --> 04:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
healthy beneficial relationship between
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
the children and the other parent and
 
04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
shall not demean or speak out negatively
 
04:32:49.469 --> 04:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
in any manner that would damage the
 
04:32:51.910 --> 04:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
relationship between either parent and
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
the children
 
04:32:56.550 --> 04:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
forcing or encouraging your child to
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
testify against one of their parents in
 
04:33:01.750 --> 04:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
no way promotes a healthy or beneficial
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
relationship between the child and their
 
04:33:05.670 --> 04:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
other parent
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
ironically it also puts a condition on a
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
minor child to speak out negatively
 
04:33:13.629 --> 04:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
about one parent while
 
04:33:16.150 --> 04:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
simultaneously advising parents the
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
adults against doing that very thing
 
04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
in fact if passed this bill would be in
 
04:33:23.910 --> 04:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
direct contrast to the state's policy
 
04:33:28.070 --> 04:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
under rsa 461 a2 which is that children
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
do best when both parents have a stable
 
04:33:31.590 --> 04:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
and meaningful involvement in their
 
04:33:31.600 --> 04:33:32.629 align:start position:0%
and meaningful involvement in their
lives

04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
lives
 
04:33:34.709 --> 04:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
allowing for children to testify against
 
04:33:36.230 --> 04:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
their parents in a family court
 
04:33:39.429 --> 04:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
proceeding has significant potential to
 
04:33:41.670 --> 04:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
irreparably harm the parent-child
 
04:33:44.070 --> 04:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
relationship and is likely to lead to
 
04:33:45.910 --> 04:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
instability and further tension and
 
04:33:48.230 --> 04:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
conflict within the family unit
 
04:33:50.070 --> 04:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
this bill does not account for existing
 
04:33:52.949 --> 04:33:52.959 align:start position:0%
court practices rule point two point
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
family division rule two point eight
 
04:33:58.150 --> 04:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
um allows uh states that a child should
 
04:34:00.070 --> 04:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
not be brought to court as a witness or
 
04:34:02.551 --> 04:34:02.561 align:start position:0%
to attend a hearing
 
04:34:05.109 --> 04:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
unless there is prior written order from
 
04:34:06.629 --> 04:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
a court allowing that child's
 
04:34:06.639 --> 04:34:08.150 align:start position:0%
a court allowing that child's
participation

04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
participation
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
so the court does recognize that there
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
are some circumstances where child
 
04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
testimony may be warranted but certainly
 
04:34:17.109 --> 04:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
that is the exception not the rule this
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
is intentionally done to protect
 
04:34:20.629 --> 04:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
children from the process which is
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
likely to be adversarial
 
04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
traditionally it was the gal who would
 
04:34:26.470 --> 04:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
interview the child and report back to
 
04:34:28.230 --> 04:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
the court about the child's demeanor
 
04:34:30.789 --> 04:34:30.799 align:start position:0%
concerns and preferences
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
this process while at times is not
 
04:34:35.189 --> 04:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
perfect and may even be problematic was
 
04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for children's voices to
 
04:34:39.429 --> 04:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
be heard while being spared from being
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
placed squarely in the middle of a
 
04:34:43.109 --> 04:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
contested court battle
 
04:34:45.189 --> 04:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
with the elimination of the gal fund in
 
04:34:45.199 --> 04:34:46.709 align:start position:0%
with the elimination of the gal fund in
2011

04:34:46.709 --> 04:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
2011
 
04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
families who are unable to pay for a gal
 
04:34:51.429 --> 04:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
no longer have a jail appointed to their
 
04:34:51.439 --> 04:34:52.310 align:start position:0%
no longer have a jail appointed to their
case

04:34:52.310 --> 04:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
as a result some judges have been more
 
04:34:56.390 --> 04:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
inclined to interview children in
 
04:34:58.230 --> 04:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
chambers in the process that you just
 
04:35:00.390 --> 04:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
heard from mr head
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
and this is done in an effort to
 
04:35:03.910 --> 04:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
increase access to justice in those
 
04:35:07.269 --> 04:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
cases involving low-income litigants
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
another person testified earlier today
 
04:35:11.269 --> 04:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
that children don't deserve to be with
 
04:35:13.670 --> 04:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
the best parent but both but that is
 
04:35:16.150 --> 04:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bill does it forces
 
04:35:19.029 --> 04:35:19.039 align:start position:0%
the child to choose the best parent
 
04:35:21.189 --> 04:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
for these reasons nhla asked this
 
04:35:22.949 --> 04:35:22.959 align:start position:0%

i used to do a lot of family law i now

i used to do a lot of family law i now
do

04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:36:07.269 --> 04:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
as little as possible um
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
but i do still i do still do it and one
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
of my big philosophies was always always
 
04:36:13.109 --> 04:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
always what's the best thing for the
 
04:36:14.629 --> 04:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
children here
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
and i turned down cases when i thought
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
the people who were coming to me were
 
04:36:21.029 --> 04:36:21.039 align:start position:0%
being unreasonable in their expectations
 
04:36:23.029 --> 04:36:23.039 align:start position:0%
and what they wanted and if i had ever
 
04:36:25.109 --> 04:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
had a parent walk into my office and say
 
04:36:28.070 --> 04:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
my 12 year old is going to testify
 
04:36:29.590 --> 04:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
that is definitely a case i would not
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
have taken because i would not want to
 
04:36:32.709 --> 04:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
have been part of harming a child in
 
04:36:33.670 --> 04:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
that way
 
04:36:36.390 --> 04:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
children should not be in court picking
 
04:36:37.990 --> 04:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
a parent against the other parent and
 
04:36:39.750 --> 04:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
then being cross-examined by the other
 
04:36:39.760 --> 04:36:41.750 align:start position:0%
then being cross-examined by the other
parent

04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
parent
 
04:36:44.310 --> 04:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's almost like the tale of solomon
 
04:36:46.390 --> 04:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
right the parent who puts that child on
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
the stand
 
04:36:50.070 --> 04:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
is harming their child
 
04:36:51.750 --> 04:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
there are ways to get that evidence as
 
04:36:55.349 --> 04:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
you've heard their guardian ad litems
 
04:36:57.590 --> 04:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
it honestly it concerns me when i hear
 
04:36:59.830 --> 04:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
people say things like children are
 
04:37:01.029 --> 04:37:01.039 align:start position:0%
writing these letters that they can't
 
04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
give the judge they're writing down all
 
04:37:03.670 --> 04:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
the time what they think should happen
 
04:37:04.869 --> 04:37:04.879 align:start position:0%
because children shouldn't even be
 
04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
involved in this process
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
now that there are exceptions i guess i
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say that too strongly but
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
there are some exceptions but for the
 
04:37:14.310 --> 04:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
most part this should be parents saying
 
04:37:16.629 --> 04:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
we're working this out mom and dad are
 
04:37:18.150 --> 04:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
trying to work this out no we've got
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
some disagreements but this is not what
 
04:37:21.510 --> 04:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
you need to worry about parents should
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
be in pr you know promoting healthy
 
04:37:25.990 --> 04:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
relationships for both parents with
 
04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
their children and having those children
 
04:37:29.990 --> 04:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
get involved take a stand against one
 
04:37:32.230 --> 04:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
child go one parent
 
04:37:34.150 --> 04:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
write letters against one parent go to
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
court and testify against one parent is
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
not that we have a standard now which
 
04:37:39.990 --> 04:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
once someone's a mature minor
 
04:37:42.070 --> 04:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
and it's not automatically 12 it's not
 
04:37:45.510 --> 04:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
automatically 14 the the
 
04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
views of that child can be taken into
 
04:37:48.789 --> 04:37:48.799 align:start position:0%
consideration and that's done as you've
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
heard through either guardian ad litem
 
04:37:51.990 --> 04:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
or the judge privately in chambers
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
talking to that child about what's going
 
04:37:56.310 --> 04:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
on what are the concerns why are they
 
04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
making that
 
04:37:59.590 --> 04:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing i'd add is that
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's not just i'm talking about 12 and
 
04:38:03.750 --> 04:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
14 year olds i would say this applies
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
all the way up no child should there
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
should never be an automatic we're going
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
to put the child on the stand if there's
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary circumstance and the
 
04:38:13.349 --> 04:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
judge thinks it's appropriate in my
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
experience the judges are very concerned
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
about trying to do what's right for the
 
04:38:19.109 --> 04:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
children trying to weigh all the
 
04:38:21.670 --> 04:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
evidence in family court which is a very
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
difficult place to be often
 
04:38:26.230 --> 04:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
the large number of pro se litigants
 
04:38:28.390 --> 04:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
makes that even more difficult
 
04:38:28.400 --> 04:38:29.750 align:start position:0%
makes that even more difficult
um

04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
but it's it's
 
04:38:33.269 --> 04:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
it's just not appropriate i mean i look
 
04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
at my own life my daughter who's now 20
 
04:38:38.949 --> 04:38:38.959 align:start position:0%
when she was 16 and 17 she hated me
 
04:38:38.959 --> 04:38:39.990 align:start position:0%
when she was 16 and 17 she hated me
um

04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know and if you've got little kids
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
anyone you know it's common
 
04:38:46.869 --> 04:38:46.879 align:start position:0%
she's a great kid she loves me now but
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
would we still have that relationship if
 
04:38:51.189 --> 04:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
that had been she's going to be in court
 
04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
telling everyone how much she hates me
 
04:38:54.551 --> 04:38:54.561 align:start position:0%
and how horrible her life is with her
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
mother and
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
and all that instead of us working it
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
out and doing doing the things that we
 
04:39:03.029 --> 04:39:03.039 align:start position:0%
did so i would i would ask you please uh
 
04:39:05.910 --> 04:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
vote in expedient to legislate this bill
 
04:39:07.830 --> 04:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take questions
 
04:39:10.230 --> 04:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:39:12.390 --> 04:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
04:39:14.629 --> 04:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony the um
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
have you
 
04:39:21.750 --> 04:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
had um
 
04:39:23.670 --> 04:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
cases where the child went in the
 
04:39:25.590 --> 04:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
chambers and spoke with the judge yes
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
can i follow up if i may on that
 
04:39:29.029 --> 04:39:29.039 align:start position:0%
certainly follow and what was the
 
04:39:31.750 --> 04:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
disposition of those generally
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
so generally the the judge would say
 
04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of
 
04:39:39.430 --> 04:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
i've spoken with the ch the child
 
04:39:39.440 --> 04:39:41.910 align:start position:0%
i've spoken with the ch the child
um

04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:43.510 --> 04:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
their their wishes because it was
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
usually like what would the schedule be
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
are consistent with what was what is
 
04:39:49.190 --> 04:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
presented in this order
 
04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
and and then they'd issue the order
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
without getting into a lot of details
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
any details about why or what they said
 
04:39:56.470 --> 04:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
against one parent or the other parent
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%

i was removed from my mother's care from
 
04:40:43.830 --> 04:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state of vermont
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
i'm very open and honest about my
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
stories i have nothing to hide
 
04:40:47.360 --> 04:40:50.310 align:start position:0%
stories i have nothing to hide
and

04:40:50.310 --> 04:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
my father was there
 
04:40:56.150 --> 04:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
and my mother came to me crying
 
04:40:58.230 --> 04:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
and said
 
04:41:01.030 --> 04:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
your dad's trying to take you from me
 
04:41:03.270 --> 04:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
i was about 11 to 12 years old at that
 
04:41:03.280 --> 04:41:04.310 align:start position:0%
i was about 11 to 12 years old at that
time

04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:41:04.320 --> 04:41:05.190 align:start position:0%
time
now

04:41:05.190 --> 04:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
despite now as a grown-up i probably
 
04:41:08.788 --> 04:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
would have been better off with my
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
father because my mother was an abusive
 
04:41:13.270 --> 04:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
person and now i realize that
 
04:41:16.470 --> 04:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
i was about 12 years old when
 
04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
this happened so if this bill was to
 
04:41:18.400 --> 04:41:19.350 align:start position:0%
this happened so if this bill was to
pass

04:41:19.350 --> 04:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
pass
 
04:41:21.190 --> 04:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
and i stood up
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the court hearing at my foster
 
04:41:23.280 --> 04:41:24.230 align:start position:0%
in the court hearing at my foster
hearing

04:41:24.230 --> 04:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:41:26.708 --> 04:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
and told the judge i want nothing to do
 
04:41:28.868 --> 04:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
with my father
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about now i i
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
do oppose this bill for
 
04:41:36.310 --> 04:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
personal reasons and other reasons
 
04:41:37.590 --> 04:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's a better way that we can go
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
about doing this
 
04:41:41.430 --> 04:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
in my adult years
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
i was a parent educator for a company
 
04:41:46.868 --> 04:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that services dcyf
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
and i saw
 
04:41:48.240 --> 04:41:49.750 align:start position:0%
and i saw
firsthand

04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
firsthand
 
04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
a family
 
04:41:52.320 --> 04:41:53.670 align:start position:0%
a family
persuade

04:41:53.670 --> 04:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
persuade
 
04:41:55.750 --> 04:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
their 12-year-old daughter
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
to tell the judge
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
that they belong with mom and dad
 
04:42:02.708 --> 04:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
and these are stories these are issues
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
that are happening
 
04:42:06.550 --> 04:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons granted mine was
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
from vermont but we eventually moved
 
04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
here about 12 years a few years after
 
04:42:12.788 --> 04:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
that happened
 
04:42:14.948 --> 04:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
for those reasons i ask that we oppose
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
an itl this bill thank you
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%

04:42:24.390 --> 04:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:27.910 --> 04:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:30.470 --> 04:42:30.480 align:start position:0%

04:42:33.910 --> 04:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
will now close the hearing on house bill
 
04:42:33.920 --> 04:42:50.390 align:start position:0%
will now close the hearing on house bill
1550.

04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%

04:42:53.840 --> 04:43:03.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:43:03.350 --> 04:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
we will now open the hearing on house
 
04:43:08.310 --> 04:43:08.320 align:start position:0%

04:43:10.470 --> 04:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor
 
04:43:13.030 --> 04:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:43:15.430 --> 04:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
has everybody gotten their copy of the
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%

04:43:44.550 --> 04:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:44.560 --> 04:43:47.110 align:start position:0%

04:44:07.990 --> 04:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
this is the conclusion of the two other
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
bills about making your own recordings
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
and making your own transcripts
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
this is really why
 
04:44:17.830 --> 04:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
why the effort was made to make it uh
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
legal for people to make their own
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
recordings and transcripts and this in
 
04:44:25.830 --> 04:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
no way undoes the current press current
 
04:44:29.110 --> 04:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
method of filing an appeal to a higher
 
04:44:32.070 --> 04:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
court because the appeals currently mean
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
that you have to submit
 
04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
your official
 
04:44:37.510 --> 04:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
transcript with
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe the official uh
 
04:44:40.400 --> 04:44:41.830 align:start position:0%
and maybe the official uh
recording

04:44:41.830 --> 04:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
recording
 
04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you have to do the
 
04:44:45.990 --> 04:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
recording but in this case it would mean
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
that to file an appeal
 
04:44:50.948 --> 04:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
where the recording was wrong omitted
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
important information
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
you would up submit both you would
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
submit your own recording and transcript
 
04:44:59.920 --> 04:45:00.788 align:start position:0%
submit your own recording and transcript
and

04:45:00.788 --> 04:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:04.230 --> 04:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
the official recording and transcript
 
04:45:05.830 --> 04:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
and you would have to
 
04:45:08.390 --> 04:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh you would have to notate where they
 
04:45:10.868 --> 04:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
differed so that the court personnel
 
04:45:12.628 --> 04:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
would not have to waste a lot of time
 
04:45:15.270 --> 04:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
trying to find it
 
04:45:18.628 --> 04:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
and this is a very serious issue
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
as you've heard
 
04:45:21.590 --> 04:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
some people say and there are plenty of
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
people who've told us who are not
 
04:45:26.150 --> 04:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
testifying today that their official
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
recording and transcripts were different
 
04:45:32.948 --> 04:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
omitted really important information
 
04:45:32.958 --> 04:45:33.910 align:start position:0%
omitted really important information
so

04:45:33.910 --> 04:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:36.150 --> 04:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions i'll be
 
04:45:38.628 --> 04:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
glad to see if there's any more to
 
04:45:38.638 --> 04:45:40.550 align:start position:0%
glad to see if there's any more to
clarify

04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
04:45:45.910 --> 04:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:48.070 --> 04:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
04:46:07.830 --> 04:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
04:46:09.590 --> 04:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
04:46:09.600 --> 04:46:11.190 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
there's

04:46:11.190 --> 04:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
there's actually a series of bills one
 
04:46:15.510 --> 04:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
of one which is in judiciary
 
04:46:18.628 --> 04:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
house bill 1592 that would allow parties
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
to make their own recordings
 
04:46:22.628 --> 04:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
and then we have the other one which
 
04:46:24.788 --> 04:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
would allow the parties to
 
04:46:26.948 --> 04:46:26.958 align:start position:0%
submit their own transcripts and then
 
04:46:29.190 --> 04:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
this one which is to submit any
 
04:46:31.590 --> 04:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
recording or transcript of any relevant
 
04:46:31.600 --> 04:46:32.708 align:start position:0%
recording or transcript of any relevant
hearing

04:46:32.708 --> 04:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:46:36.788 --> 04:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
i lose track a little bit of some of the
 
04:46:42.550 --> 04:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
bills in terms of what their intent was
 
04:46:45.110 --> 04:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with allowing and
 
04:46:46.708 --> 04:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
again we're talking because we don't
 
04:46:49.270 --> 04:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
family court anymore family division
 
04:46:52.390 --> 04:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
and family division does a wide range of
 
04:46:55.350 --> 04:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
cases and this would appear to allow any
 
04:46:58.150 --> 04:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
party to record any proceeding and
 
04:47:00.550 --> 04:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
family division whether they be
 
04:47:02.550 --> 04:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
confidential whether they
 
04:47:04.628 --> 04:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
you know without regard to the subject
 
04:47:08.708 --> 04:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
matter domestic violence proceedings um
 
04:47:12.150 --> 04:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
just a wide range of types of cases some
 
04:47:15.030 --> 04:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
are extremely confident or private some
 
04:47:17.350 --> 04:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
are extreme or confidential
 
04:47:20.230 --> 04:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
in in and without any
 
04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
04:47:24.390 --> 04:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
role of of the court and again
 
04:47:26.230 --> 04:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
i understand that some have concerns
 
04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
about court discretion but court
 
04:47:30.150 --> 04:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
discretion is important because one of
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
the aspects is
 
04:47:33.430 --> 04:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
what is the subject matter being
 
04:47:36.310 --> 04:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
discussed here what is the what would
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
this recording be recording and what
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
would it be capturing
 
04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
the other problem
 
04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
the other issue with
 
04:47:45.110 --> 04:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
in concern with
 
04:47:47.830 --> 04:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
individuals recording hearings is what
 
04:47:50.230 --> 04:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
is being captured are we capturing
 
04:47:52.470 --> 04:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
conversations that are happening in the
 
04:47:54.470 --> 04:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
galley behind
 
04:47:55.910 --> 04:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
by people who don't realize they're
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
being recorded because the the
 
04:47:59.910 --> 04:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
microphone maybe of the telephone which
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
may be
 
04:48:03.910 --> 04:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
not up front but maybe in the back
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
is it capturing information that people
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
don't realize is being captured
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:12.310 --> 04:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
what's the nature of the proceeding
 
04:48:14.070 --> 04:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
because the court does not have control
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
over that recording is that something
 
04:48:17.830 --> 04:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
that would be posted on on a website or
 
04:48:19.750 --> 04:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
on the internet social media
 
04:48:22.150 --> 04:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
would it be modified in some way so that
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
it would appear in some social media
 
04:48:26.070 --> 04:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
setting to be testimony along with
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
different lines and what actually
 
04:48:27.280 --> 04:48:28.310 align:start position:0%
different lines and what actually
happened

04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:48:30.948 --> 04:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
i'm also very sensitive to testimony
 
04:48:32.550 --> 04:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
that has occurred where the court's
 
04:48:35.910 --> 04:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
recording is not complete and accurate
 
04:48:35.920 --> 04:48:37.350 align:start position:0%
recording is not complete and accurate
and

04:48:37.350 --> 04:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:39.030 --> 04:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
some of that has occurred and as you've
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
heard some testimony that
 
04:48:41.920 --> 04:48:44.070 align:start position:0%
heard some testimony that
in

04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
in circuit court
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
the judges are record are
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for controlling the
 
04:48:50.868 --> 04:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
recording we used to have what are
 
04:48:52.868 --> 04:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
called court monitors before that we had
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
core stenographers so the stenographers
 
04:48:56.948 --> 04:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
were actually doing all the the
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
stenographic and you would order the
 
04:49:01.030 --> 04:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
transcript from the court stenographer
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
then we had monitors and the monitors
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
were responsible for the recording
 
04:49:04.638 --> 04:49:05.750 align:start position:0%
were responsible for the recording
equipment

04:49:05.750 --> 04:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
04:49:08.310 --> 04:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
and then through more budget cuts we've
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
the judges are doing it now if we
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
brought it back to monitors you wouldn't
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
have sort of that concern that exists
 
04:49:16.868 --> 04:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
that we've heard in testimony here about
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
the judges controlling
 
04:49:20.310 --> 04:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
the recording
 
04:49:22.150 --> 04:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
but we don't have that currently so i
 
04:49:24.230 --> 04:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
get and i'm sensitive to the concern
 
04:49:26.788 --> 04:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
that people have raised about
 
04:49:28.948 --> 04:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
having something that would ensure that
 
04:49:31.510 --> 04:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
the recording the official recording is
 
04:49:33.750 --> 04:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
is accurate this bill however doesn't
 
04:49:35.510 --> 04:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
quite do that and i'm not quite sure
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do because
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
it would allow apparently the parties to
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
submit any recording to the supreme
 
04:49:42.000 --> 04:49:42.868 align:start position:0%
submit any recording to the supreme
court

04:49:42.868 --> 04:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
somebody else may submit another
 
04:49:45.750 --> 04:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
recording to the supreme court some of
 
04:49:48.230 --> 04:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
these hearings are multiple days you
 
04:49:50.470 --> 04:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
know so we have multiple days of
 
04:49:52.070 --> 04:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
recordings that are being given to the
 
04:49:54.550 --> 04:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
supreme court supreme court doesn't just
 
04:49:56.070 --> 04:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
04:49:57.750 --> 04:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
a particular line or a particular
 
04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
sentence in a in a
 
04:50:01.270 --> 04:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
in a transcript
 
04:50:03.430 --> 04:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's looking at the record so now we
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
have multiple days of recordings that
 
04:50:07.990 --> 04:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
the justices have to be listening to
 
04:50:10.550 --> 04:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
to sort of discern what is what is the
 
04:50:10.560 --> 04:50:12.070 align:start position:0%
to sort of discern what is what is the
record

04:50:12.070 --> 04:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
record
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
it's really not the way
 
04:50:16.948 --> 04:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
an appellate record is created
 
04:50:18.628 --> 04:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
where you have competing recordings
 
04:50:18.638 --> 04:50:19.750 align:start position:0%
where you have competing recordings
competing

04:50:19.750 --> 04:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
competing
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be it's it's really a
 
04:50:22.080 --> 04:50:23.270 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be it's it's really a
role

04:50:23.270 --> 04:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
role
 
04:50:24.628 --> 04:50:24.638 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a better way of doing it
 
04:50:27.190 --> 04:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not i'm not insensitive to
 
04:50:27.200 --> 04:50:27.990 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not i'm not insensitive to
that

04:50:27.990 --> 04:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:30.150 --> 04:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
but as this bill is written and again
 
04:50:31.510 --> 04:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the bills that are
 
04:50:33.270 --> 04:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
being presented and i haven't seen an
 
04:50:35.750 --> 04:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
amendment if there is one
 
04:50:37.510 --> 04:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
that this would just allow the parties
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
to submit any recording or any
 
04:50:41.670 --> 04:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
transcript again no standards no quality
 
04:50:41.680 --> 04:50:42.708 align:start position:0%
transcript again no standards no quality
control

04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:50:42.718 --> 04:50:43.910 align:start position:0%
control
no

04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:50:46.550 --> 04:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
sort of unclear as to what that means
 
04:50:47.670 --> 04:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
to the appellate court and then the
 
04:50:49.510 --> 04:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
appellate court decides which may be
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
used as the basis for the appeal and
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's really the burden of the parties to
 
04:50:56.310 --> 04:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
present to the court what the record is
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
and if under this scenario it's really
 
04:51:00.550 --> 04:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
your the parties are leaving it to the
 
04:51:02.788 --> 04:51:02.798 align:start position:0%
court to determine what the record is
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
when they're not the appealing party the
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
court has to be the unbiased supreme
 
04:51:08.708 --> 04:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
court's the unbiased receiver of what
 
04:51:11.110 --> 04:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
the record is it has to be
 
04:51:14.230 --> 04:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
sort of as accurate as it can be
 
04:51:14.240 --> 04:51:15.190 align:start position:0%
sort of as accurate as it can be
so

04:51:15.190 --> 04:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:16.948 --> 04:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
whether there's an amendment that gets
 
04:51:19.270 --> 04:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
to a particular issue i don't know but
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
this would just have
 
04:51:24.310 --> 04:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
without any ability of of a trial judge
 
04:51:26.070 --> 04:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
to decide given the context of the
 
04:51:28.230 --> 04:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
hearing whatever a right to record in
 
04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
that recording of whatever equality is
 
04:51:33.190 --> 04:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
now the potentially the record that's
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to the supreme court it just have
 
04:51:37.670 --> 04:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
significant grave concerns and again as
 
04:51:39.510 --> 04:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
i testified earlier there is at least a
 
04:51:42.470 --> 04:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
court rule that would allow
 
04:51:44.230 --> 04:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
parties to stipulate as to what the
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
record is
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
again i get and i understand that these
 
04:51:50.708 --> 04:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
can be incredibly contentious
 
04:51:52.628 --> 04:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
cases but
 
04:51:54.948 --> 04:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
but there is at least another avenue for
 
04:51:56.948 --> 04:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
for presenting the record
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
if there are other ideas and solutions
 
04:52:01.030 --> 04:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
as i said before what we're talking
 
04:52:02.550 --> 04:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
about here are the rules of the
 
04:52:04.868 --> 04:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
appellate court and there is a rules
 
04:52:06.470 --> 04:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
advisory committee there's a rules
 
04:52:07.910 --> 04:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
making process if people have
 
04:52:10.948 --> 04:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
suggestions on rules about what is the
 
04:52:10.958 --> 04:52:11.910 align:start position:0%
suggestions on rules about what is the
record

04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
record
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
it's really not it's a judicial function
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
as to
 
04:52:17.830 --> 04:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
what is the official record that goes to
 
04:52:19.750 --> 04:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
04:52:21.830 --> 04:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd be happy to
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you thank you
 
04:52:28.868 --> 04:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:30.628 --> 04:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
next i'll call katrina heinrich
 
04:52:36.550 --> 04:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
you asked for three minutes we'll give
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:49.920 --> 04:52:51.270 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:52:51.270 --> 04:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:52:55.510 --> 04:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:00.948 --> 04:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:04.230 --> 04:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:07.110 --> 04:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
that the intent of this bill
 
04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
has some merit
 
04:53:12.310 --> 04:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
but it does need some amendments as to
 
04:53:14.948 --> 04:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
what those amendments are that that
 
04:53:17.350 --> 04:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be determined
 
04:53:19.030 --> 04:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that has popped up
 
04:53:21.030 --> 04:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
in testimony
 
04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
was the fact that
 
04:53:24.628 --> 04:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
judges that are supposed to remain
 
04:53:27.190 --> 04:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
altered and neutral
 
04:53:30.390 --> 04:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
can control the record
 
04:53:33.430 --> 04:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
i believe a bill like this needs to add
 
04:53:34.390 --> 04:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
some kind
 
04:53:36.150 --> 04:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
of element
 
04:53:38.868 --> 04:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
that holds them accountable
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
so official court recordings
 
04:53:43.990 --> 04:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
that bear missing time and discrepancies
 
04:53:45.750 --> 04:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
shall be deemed suspicious and possibly
 
04:53:47.270 --> 04:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
altered and subject to penalties under
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rsa 64.7
 
04:53:52.230 --> 04:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
i think something like that is is
 
04:53:54.628 --> 04:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
critical when we're talking about
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
well no we're not going to give you a
 
04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
right to actually have a recording that
 
04:53:59.350 --> 04:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
might prove
 
04:54:00.868 --> 04:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
you were telling the truth and somebody
 
04:54:02.628 --> 04:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
else altered it
 
04:54:04.150 --> 04:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
these are these are issues we certainly
 
04:54:05.670 --> 04:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
need to look at
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
as i've already stated in my case the
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
discrepancies and missing time segments
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
is an issue
 
04:54:13.590 --> 04:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
i observed both ethical and procedural
 
04:54:16.070 --> 04:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
misconduct by the officiant toward one
 
04:54:17.670 --> 04:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
party in a case which i've already
 
04:54:20.948 --> 04:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
i think it bears maybe a little more
 
04:54:25.830 --> 04:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
scrutiny but i don't believe it should
 
04:54:27.270 --> 04:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
just be tabled
 
04:54:27.280 --> 04:54:28.470 align:start position:0%
just be tabled
thanks

04:54:28.470 --> 04:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:32.628 --> 04:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:33.830 --> 04:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:54:37.410 --> 04:54:37.420 align:start position:0%
i'll call on the final uh speaker
 
04:54:37.420 --> 04:54:38.550 align:start position:0%
i'll call on the final uh speaker

dana albrecht
 
04:54:45.190 --> 04:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
you asked for 30 seconds again thank you
 
04:54:48.550 --> 04:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
maybe back up to 45 because
 
04:54:53.670 --> 04:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh so this echoes the issues on hb 1551.
 
04:54:56.948 --> 04:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
you already heard my testimony uh on
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
that so i won't repeat it
 
04:55:01.510 --> 04:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh for this i just like to point out
 
04:55:04.470 --> 04:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
that currently the record is governed by
 
04:55:07.510 --> 04:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
supreme court rule 59
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
and when because of the issues in my
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
case i asked the trial court clerk to
 
04:55:15.430 --> 04:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
provide me with a
 
04:55:18.470 --> 04:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
certified cd of audio
 
04:55:20.788 --> 04:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
by that i had in mind she'd sign it some
 
04:55:22.550 --> 04:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
kind of seal the same way you do with
 
04:55:24.390 --> 04:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
paper copies
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
uh just indicating that the clerk was
 
04:55:29.110 --> 04:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
representing that this was true and
 
04:55:29.120 --> 04:55:30.390 align:start position:0%
representing that this was true and
accurate

04:55:30.390 --> 04:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
04:55:30.400 --> 04:55:31.830 align:start position:0%
accurate
audio

04:55:31.830 --> 04:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
audio
 
04:55:31.840 --> 04:55:32.868 align:start position:0%
audio
um

04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:36.150 --> 04:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
and apparently that's prohibited under
 
04:55:39.270 --> 04:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court rule 59
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
so there's no way we can ask the court
 
04:55:44.310 --> 04:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:55:44.320 --> 04:55:45.510 align:start position:0%
right now
for

04:55:45.510 --> 04:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
official audio you know
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing as official audio
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
and i just think it would be valuable
 
04:55:56.310 --> 04:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
for us to at least be able to do that
 
04:55:56.320 --> 04:55:57.670 align:start position:0%
for us to at least be able to do that
um

04:55:57.670 --> 04:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
that concludes my comments
 
04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:56:04.788 --> 04:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:56:06.788 --> 04:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
04:56:10.708 --> 04:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
you madam chairman and that concludes
 
04:56:14.948 --> 04:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
the hearings on house bill 1511 fn i
 
04:56:28.628 --> 04:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:31.110 --> 04:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
we can now open the hearing with a pink
 
04:56:43.670 --> 04:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:43.680 --> 04:56:50.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:56:50.310 --> 04:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
however you choose
 
04:56:52.320 --> 04:57:09.350 align:start position:0%
however you choose
representative

04:57:09.350 --> 04:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:21.270 --> 04:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:21.280 --> 04:57:22.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:57:25.110 --> 04:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to open the hearing on
 
04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:36.000 --> 04:57:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
whoops

04:57:39.590 --> 04:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:42.788 --> 04:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
supposedly there's already a rule
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
that judges can rule that
 
04:57:48.948 --> 04:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
motions are excessive
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
but apparently it happens so frequently
 
04:57:56.948 --> 04:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
that that's why i've submitted this bill
 
04:57:58.150 --> 04:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:58:01.510 --> 04:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
people are being harassed by it is a
 
04:58:03.030 --> 04:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
favorite way
 
04:58:04.868 --> 04:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
to harass
 
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
the person that you aren't happy with
 
04:58:10.948 --> 04:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
so um even though
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
even though you're like for
 
04:58:15.510 --> 04:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
instance for child support
 
04:58:17.910 --> 04:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
there's really a rule that you can only
 
04:58:19.030 --> 04:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
address it
 
04:58:20.550 --> 04:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
every three years
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
and yet you're going to hear from people
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
who have emotion filed against them
 
04:58:26.948 --> 04:58:26.958 align:start position:0%
every two months
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
and so uh
 
04:58:30.550 --> 04:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's why this that's the real basis
 
04:58:33.190 --> 04:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
for this rule uh for this bill
 
04:58:36.390 --> 04:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh to stop these frivolous excessive
 
04:58:36.400 --> 04:58:37.670 align:start position:0%
uh to stop these frivolous excessive
harassing

04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
harassing
 
04:58:37.680 --> 04:58:38.550 align:start position:0%
harassing
um

04:58:38.550 --> 04:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:38.560 --> 04:58:40.150 align:start position:0%
um
filings

04:58:40.150 --> 04:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
filings
 
04:58:43.750 --> 04:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
that uh a judge should be able to tell
 
04:58:45.990 --> 04:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
is is unfounded
 
04:58:46.000 --> 04:58:46.868 align:start position:0%
is is unfounded
um

04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
the testimony uh sheet from again
 
04:58:52.390 --> 04:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
that mother of two daughters
 
04:58:52.400 --> 04:58:53.430 align:start position:0%
that mother of two daughters
um

04:58:53.430 --> 04:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:55.830 --> 04:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
she says my case spanned many years with
 
04:58:57.510 --> 04:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
countless filings
 
04:59:00.070 --> 04:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
her parents she told me her parents
 
04:59:01.990 --> 04:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
paid for her legal fees
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
apparently her ex had a lot more money
 
04:59:05.350 --> 04:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
than she did
 
04:59:07.750 --> 04:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
and he ran up because she would have to
 
04:59:10.550 --> 04:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
answer his filings and she was afraid to
 
04:59:14.470 --> 04:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
go pro se her parents paid 500 000
 
04:59:14.480 --> 04:59:15.590 align:start position:0%
go pro se her parents paid 500 000
dollars

04:59:15.590 --> 04:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
to respond to his constant harassing
 
04:59:21.990 --> 04:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
emotions she said i was eventually let
 
04:59:24.070 --> 04:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
go from my job due to the days off i
 
04:59:26.390 --> 04:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
required to attend court hearings and
 
04:59:29.510 --> 04:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
court ordered appointments
 
04:59:32.550 --> 04:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
she was also ordered to go to years
 
04:59:32.560 --> 04:59:35.990 align:start position:0%
she was also ordered to go to years
of

04:59:35.990 --> 04:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:36.000 --> 04:59:37.110 align:start position:0%
 
therapy

04:59:37.110 --> 04:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
04:59:39.350 --> 04:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
to determine whether she was a stable
 
04:59:39.360 --> 04:59:40.788 align:start position:0%
to determine whether she was a stable
person

04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:59:40.798 --> 04:59:41.990 align:start position:0%
person
and

04:59:41.990 --> 04:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:43.830 --> 04:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
so that got that was expensive and that
 
04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
took a lot of time
 
04:59:48.470 --> 04:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
so she says overall the solution would
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
be to limit the
 
04:59:52.470 --> 04:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
the length child custody cases remain
 
04:59:52.480 --> 04:59:53.830 align:start position:0%
the length child custody cases remain
open

04:59:53.830 --> 04:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
open
 
04:59:55.590 --> 04:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
especially where there's substantial
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
evidence for one parent to have custody
 
04:59:59.760 --> 05:00:02.150 align:start position:0%
evidence for one parent to have custody
um

05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
you know that's
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
the dad the dad was a drug addict and
 
05:00:11.110 --> 05:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
had other things that made the kids not
 
05:00:13.750 --> 05:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
want to be with him so anyway i to me
 
05:00:15.910 --> 05:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very simple
 
05:00:18.230 --> 05:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple request
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
that the judge uses their their legal
 
05:00:23.670 --> 05:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
power to deny
 
05:00:27.030 --> 05:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
motions that are repetitive excessive
 
05:00:46.948 --> 05:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:13.990 --> 05:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair members of the
 
05:01:17.190 --> 05:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
05:01:18.868 --> 05:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch we don't have a
 
05:01:23.350 --> 05:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but
 
05:01:23.360 --> 05:01:24.390 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but
some

05:01:24.390 --> 05:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:01:27.270 --> 05:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
um information there is a rule as as you
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
heard that would allow parties to if
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
there are sort of harassing pleadings
 
05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
that are being filed for the parties to
 
05:01:38.070 --> 05:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
essentially not have to respond
 
05:01:39.830 --> 05:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
that does get used
 
05:01:42.150 --> 05:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
and it has been used
 
05:01:45.590 --> 05:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
one thing that a in in in so i
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
practice litigation for a better part of
 
05:01:48.628 --> 05:01:48.638 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
05:01:50.550 --> 05:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
one thing i know about rules is rules
 
05:01:53.670 --> 05:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
beget more litigation so once you create
 
05:01:57.670 --> 05:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
a rule which which would itself impose
 
05:01:59.590 --> 05:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
costs and penalties
 
05:02:01.590 --> 05:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to see motions asking for
 
05:02:03.430 --> 05:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
those to be imposed and you're going to
 
05:02:05.350 --> 05:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
see more litigation over
 
05:02:08.230 --> 05:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not something is harassing
 
05:02:10.390 --> 05:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
it it's just an inevitable part of
 
05:02:11.910 --> 05:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
putting together a rule like this you're
 
05:02:13.510 --> 05:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
going to see more litigation perhaps
 
05:02:15.990 --> 05:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
more harassing litigation over over
 
05:02:17.990 --> 05:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
05:02:20.310 --> 05:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
in in the context of
 
05:02:22.390 --> 05:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
divorce and family division
 
05:02:24.310 --> 05:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
as as you've also heard there are a
 
05:02:27.430 --> 05:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
significant number of pro se parties who
 
05:02:29.830 --> 05:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
are not represented with an attorney
 
05:02:29.840 --> 05:02:31.190 align:start position:0%
are not represented with an attorney
and

05:02:31.190 --> 05:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
it is true that judges do give
 
05:02:33.600 --> 05:02:35.350 align:start position:0%
it is true that judges do give
some

05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:02:37.190 --> 05:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
leniency not leniency is the wrong word
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
but some
 
05:02:42.230 --> 05:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
leeway um for for unrepresented parties
 
05:02:44.390 --> 05:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
who may not be familiar with the system
 
05:02:46.628 --> 05:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
um in the nature of their filings it
 
05:02:48.070 --> 05:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
does not mean that they're allowed to be
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
harassing it does not mean that they're
 
05:02:51.670 --> 05:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to be intimidating
 
05:02:53.830 --> 05:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
but a judge does take into account the
 
05:02:55.430 --> 05:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
sophistication of the party and whether
 
05:02:57.430 --> 05:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
or not they're an attorney if there is
 
05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
an attorney that is filing it and the
 
05:03:01.990 --> 05:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
judge believes that the those are
 
05:03:04.868 --> 05:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
being filed improperly
 
05:03:07.270 --> 05:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
that judge can direct that attorney to
 
05:03:12.390 --> 05:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
to stop filing them and can impose
 
05:03:14.788 --> 05:03:14.798 align:start position:0%
sanctions in terms of a referral
 
05:03:17.110 --> 05:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh to the professional conduct committee
 
05:03:18.788 --> 05:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
if that's appropriate
 
05:03:19.990 --> 05:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
but what
 
05:03:22.788 --> 05:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
the bill sort of as written simply says
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
that if the judge finds that there's
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
excessive or harassing legal uh filings
 
05:03:29.990 --> 05:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
that they can incur that they can impose
 
05:03:32.628 --> 05:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
these penalties
 
05:03:34.390 --> 05:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that's going to change the
 
05:03:37.110 --> 05:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
number of of these of those cases that
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
are found to be
 
05:03:40.868 --> 05:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
intimidating harassing but it will
 
05:03:42.628 --> 05:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
itself create some more litigation over
 
05:03:44.788 --> 05:03:44.798 align:start position:0%
that over that subject matter
 
05:03:46.868 --> 05:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
the bill is also and i think there was
 
05:03:48.628 --> 05:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
an amendment which i've not seen but it
 
05:03:50.948 --> 05:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
also says that it shall report such
 
05:03:52.708 --> 05:03:52.718 align:start position:0%
conduct to the supreme court committee
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
on professional conduct
 
05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
which is which is appropriate but only
 
05:04:00.550 --> 05:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
if the party doing it is is an attorney
 
05:04:03.190 --> 05:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
so and as i said the vast vast majority
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
of these cases are pro se so there is no
 
05:04:07.670 --> 05:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
attorney um so there would be no
 
05:04:09.670 --> 05:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
referral and
 
05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
and so i'm not sure what that line was
 
05:04:14.310 --> 05:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
intended to to um
 
05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
to to do
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
since most of these are not going to be
 
05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
caused by an attorney
 
05:04:21.510 --> 05:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
but i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
05:04:22.708 --> 05:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
if there are any again we don't have a
 
05:04:24.628 --> 05:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
particular position on the bill but just
 
05:04:28.708 --> 05:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:37.510 --> 05:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:37.520 --> 05:04:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:04:39.270 --> 05:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:42.070 --> 05:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
next we have
 
05:04:47.350 --> 05:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:49.350 --> 05:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
you've asked for three minutes if we can
 
05:05:01.190 --> 05:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:01.200 --> 05:05:23.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
this is um i'm katrina heinrich
 
05:05:28.628 --> 05:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
again sorry about that but
 
05:05:29.910 --> 05:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
this case
 
05:05:31.190 --> 05:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
is my case
 
05:05:33.430 --> 05:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
this is over 30 pages long and this is
 
05:05:35.030 --> 05:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
the case summary
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
all it is is it says how many hearings
 
05:05:38.708 --> 05:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
and stuff there's been
 
05:05:41.510 --> 05:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
within the first year post-divorce
 
05:05:44.310 --> 05:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
there was numerous exportes all
 
05:05:44.320 --> 05:05:45.830 align:start position:0%
there was numerous exportes all
frivolous

05:05:45.830 --> 05:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
frivolous
 
05:05:45.840 --> 05:05:46.868 align:start position:0%
frivolous
nothing

05:05:46.868 --> 05:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
05:05:48.470 --> 05:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
there was nothing
 
05:05:51.270 --> 05:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
and yet the judges gave merit to them
 
05:05:53.670 --> 05:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
this is part of a process
 
05:05:57.350 --> 05:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
it has been well documented again
 
05:06:00.708 --> 05:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
in the proclamation that the
 
05:06:04.070 --> 05:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:05.830 --> 05:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
the studies support exactly what we're
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
saying again it's across the united
 
05:06:10.230 --> 05:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
states not just new hampshire
 
05:06:13.670 --> 05:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's a process a methodology to
 
05:06:16.708 --> 05:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
finding the cases that they're going to
 
05:06:16.718 --> 05:06:18.868 align:start position:0%
finding the cases that they're going to
elongate

05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
elongate
 
05:06:21.670 --> 05:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
my cases happen be one of them
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
but it has to have
 
05:06:28.230 --> 05:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:31.350 --> 05:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
the studies choose to use words like it
 
05:06:33.830 --> 05:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
has to be post-divorce
 
05:06:35.030 --> 05:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
they say
 
05:06:36.470 --> 05:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
well the court already during the
 
05:06:38.788 --> 05:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
divorce already has all your financials
 
05:06:40.948 --> 05:06:40.958 align:start position:0%
they know where your assets are
 
05:06:42.470 --> 05:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
there has to be an unhealthy parent
 
05:06:44.470 --> 05:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
there has to be a healthy parent
 
05:06:46.470 --> 05:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
the discovery documents are critical and
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
then of course the gal outsider
 
05:06:48.400 --> 05:06:50.628 align:start position:0%
then of course the gal outsider
information

05:06:50.628 --> 05:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:06:52.470 --> 05:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
these pieces are necessary for any of
 
05:06:53.990 --> 05:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
these cases that i've been talking about
 
05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
like mine to proceed
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the inherent over
 
05:07:00.480 --> 05:07:02.070 align:start position:0%
with the inherent over
filings

05:07:02.070 --> 05:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
filings
 
05:07:04.948 --> 05:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
it affects jobs it affects
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
visitation no matter who has the child
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
it just is a constant reminder in my
 
05:07:10.080 --> 05:07:11.350 align:start position:0%
it just is a constant reminder in my
case

05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
every friday that there was visitation
 
05:07:15.510 --> 05:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
there was something filed that would
 
05:07:18.788 --> 05:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
inherently ruin that visitation
 
05:07:21.430 --> 05:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
the judge would not be able to hear it
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
so you lost another one this was a way
 
05:07:26.948 --> 05:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
to slowly take away visitation
 
05:07:28.628 --> 05:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
so in my case experience the other party
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
was permitted to file meritless exportes
 
05:07:32.830 --> 05:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
frivolous emotional slander and
 
05:07:35.030 --> 05:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
allegations the filings were not only
 
05:07:37.350 --> 05:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
entertained but the entertaining of them
 
05:07:39.430 --> 05:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
always finding in the favor of the filer
 
05:07:41.990 --> 05:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
the court encouraged his behavior he was
 
05:07:42.000 --> 05:07:43.270 align:start position:0%
the court encouraged his behavior he was
very

05:07:43.270 --> 05:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:07:45.910 --> 05:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
very outspoken and arrogant about it he
 
05:07:48.470 --> 05:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
could file as much as he wanted
 
05:07:50.230 --> 05:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
with the lack of due process the court
 
05:07:51.670 --> 05:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
did not require any evidence of
 
05:07:51.680 --> 05:07:52.948 align:start position:0%
did not require any evidence of
allegations

05:07:52.948 --> 05:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
allegations
 
05:07:55.270 --> 05:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
instead permitted the frivolous motions
 
05:07:56.948 --> 05:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
to be used to prevent established
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
visitations to control my movement
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
through society that included access to
 
05:08:05.110 --> 05:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
children's events activities access to
 
05:08:06.628 --> 05:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
records and more
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
and remember
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of the divorce i was the
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
primary parent because i was always the
 
05:08:13.510 --> 05:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
primary parent
 
05:08:16.550 --> 05:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
but that switched in these ex partes for
 
05:08:18.788 --> 05:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
no valid reasons
 
05:08:20.708 --> 05:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
my children were healthy
 
05:08:20.718 --> 05:08:21.670 align:start position:0%
my children were healthy
clean

05:08:21.670 --> 05:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
clean
 
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
and well educated they were very out
 
05:08:26.550 --> 05:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
well spoken and considered above average
 
05:08:29.670 --> 05:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
yet the court refused to listen to those
 
05:08:29.680 --> 05:08:31.270 align:start position:0%
yet the court refused to listen to those
facts

05:08:31.270 --> 05:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
facts
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
in entertaining these baseless filings
 
05:08:35.350 --> 05:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
the court undermines the public trust
 
05:08:38.310 --> 05:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
and the integrity of the institution
 
05:08:39.990 --> 05:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
the court has the ability to protect
 
05:08:42.628 --> 05:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
crisis and post divorce on facts from
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
the discovery process
 
05:08:47.830 --> 05:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
once established the gal reengages and
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
frivolous filings begin and final
 
05:08:52.390 --> 05:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
divorce is turned upside down
 
05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
the damage goes beyond financial and
 
05:08:58.708 --> 05:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:00.948 --> 05:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
in the end they are artificially
 
05:09:02.948 --> 05:09:02.958 align:start position:0%
manufacturing a brand new reality this
 
05:09:04.788 --> 05:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
brings me back to the testimony i gave
 
05:09:07.030 --> 05:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
you earlier in the day where once you
 
05:09:09.270 --> 05:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
are out of divorce court they start at
 
05:09:11.590 --> 05:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
zero and they create an artificial
 
05:09:13.910 --> 05:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
reality and these cases get prolonged
 
05:09:17.270 --> 05:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
again mine is over a decade old
 
05:09:18.550 --> 05:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
05:09:20.070 --> 05:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say about it thank
 
05:09:20.080 --> 05:09:21.910 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say about it thank
you

05:09:21.910 --> 05:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:29.350 --> 05:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
05:09:32.948 --> 05:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
i'll next call on anna goulet zimmerman
 
05:09:46.390 --> 05:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:48.550 --> 05:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
again my name is anna goulet zimmerman i
 
05:09:51.270 --> 05:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
practice law in manchester and i am a
 
05:09:52.550 --> 05:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
member of the new hampshire association
 
05:09:54.310 --> 05:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
for justice
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
i would point out that with regard to
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys under our rules of ethics
 
05:10:00.310 --> 05:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
professional conduct 3.1 already
 
05:10:02.070 --> 05:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
prohibits attorneys from frivolous
 
05:10:02.080 --> 05:10:03.190 align:start position:0%
prohibits attorneys from frivolous
filings

05:10:03.190 --> 05:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
filings
 
05:10:08.150 --> 05:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
and there is actually an rsa rsa 507 15
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
which applies generally to all courts
 
05:10:14.310 --> 05:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
and covers this exact same language
 
05:10:15.990 --> 05:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i would start by saying i don't see
 
05:10:18.470 --> 05:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
why there's any need to
 
05:10:20.708 --> 05:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
add this separately into two separate
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
provisions of the family law statutes
 
05:10:25.030 --> 05:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
where it already exists
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
i would also add that the courts do have
 
05:10:29.350 --> 05:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
the ability to limit the frivolous
 
05:10:31.830 --> 05:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
filings you have to ask for it
 
05:10:34.150 --> 05:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
i was trying to remember if it's once or
 
05:10:35.910 --> 05:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
twice i think i've asked for it twice
 
05:10:37.510 --> 05:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
and i might have gotten it twice but i
 
05:10:38.948 --> 05:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
know there's at least one case where i
 
05:10:40.948 --> 05:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
just filed a motion saying
 
05:10:42.628 --> 05:10:42.638 align:start position:0%
please tell me i can stop answering
 
05:10:45.350 --> 05:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
these things it's it's taking too much
 
05:10:47.190 --> 05:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
time and it's going to cost my clients
 
05:10:51.190 --> 05:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
money and this is this is just harassing
 
05:10:53.110 --> 05:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
as a pro say on the other side and i
 
05:10:55.590 --> 05:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
said and i propose that if there was a
 
05:10:58.070 --> 05:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
motion that the court thought might be
 
05:11:00.070 --> 05:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
require a response they would notify me
 
05:11:01.750 --> 05:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
and my 10 days to file my objection
 
05:11:03.670 --> 05:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
would happen at that time and it worked
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
great i just stopped responding to
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
anything for about a year and a half and
 
05:11:08.470 --> 05:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
then there was one that came up and we
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
we had to answer it so there are
 
05:11:14.550 --> 05:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
remedies already in place um
 
05:11:16.830 --> 05:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
and this is just unnecessary thank
 
05:11:19.110 --> 05:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions
 
05:11:21.030 --> 05:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative belanger
 
05:11:22.788 --> 05:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh thank you
 
05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240 align:start position:0%

05:11:26.550 --> 05:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
testimony quick question so
 
05:11:27.990 --> 05:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned you're an attorney correct
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
yes okay follow-up to that technically
 
05:11:34.070 --> 05:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
certainly was just clarifying so um
 
05:11:36.948 --> 05:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
if if you as an attorney
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
were filing repeatedly over and over and
 
05:11:41.110 --> 05:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
over and over again do you think the
 
05:11:43.590 --> 05:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
judge would catch on and go
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:11:46.550 --> 05:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on absolutely
 
05:11:47.990 --> 05:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
oh what
 
05:11:49.750 --> 05:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry will you certainly follow up
 
05:11:51.190 --> 05:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay and then
 
05:11:53.830 --> 05:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
second to that don't you have a ethical
 
05:11:57.910 --> 05:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
obligation to to not do that yes yep
 
05:11:59.910 --> 05:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's the rule 3.1 i have an ethical
 
05:12:01.430 --> 05:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
obligation not to
 
05:12:03.990 --> 05:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
um the court can report me
 
05:12:04.000 --> 05:12:05.670 align:start position:0%
um the court can report me
um

05:12:05.670 --> 05:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:07.110 --> 05:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
if there's an opposing a counsel
 
05:12:09.190 --> 05:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
opposing counsel could afford you know
 
05:12:11.110 --> 05:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
it could could do that
 
05:12:13.190 --> 05:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
most often or again we're talking about
 
05:12:15.190 --> 05:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
about pro ses and then of course the
 
05:12:17.110 --> 05:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
other problem is as an attorney
 
05:12:17.120 --> 05:12:18.550 align:start position:0%
other problem is as an attorney
um

05:12:18.550 --> 05:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:21.030 --> 05:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
we only have half the story when we hear
 
05:12:23.350 --> 05:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
the story right so we get lots of we get
 
05:12:25.350 --> 05:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
lots of calls that sound like oh my gosh
 
05:12:27.430 --> 05:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
this horrible thing has happened
 
05:12:27.440 --> 05:12:28.390 align:start position:0%
this horrible thing has happened
and

05:12:28.390 --> 05:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:29.910 --> 05:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
i always would start those by calling
 
05:12:32.230 --> 05:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
the other the opposing counsel and say
 
05:12:33.350 --> 05:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
help me understand do you know what's
 
05:12:34.550 --> 05:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
going on
 
05:12:34.560 --> 05:12:36.230 align:start position:0%
going on
um

05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
but sometimes you can't reach someone
 
05:12:39.510 --> 05:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes it is something that requires
 
05:12:42.310 --> 05:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
immediate action and you take it based
 
05:12:44.788 --> 05:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
on you know good faith and
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
what you believe is the right thing at
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
that time and then sometimes it you know
 
05:12:49.990 --> 05:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
you find out there's more to the story
 
05:12:52.628 --> 05:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
as there often is but but we're all
 
05:12:54.550 --> 05:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
we're all kind of going into the system
 
05:12:56.708 --> 05:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
usually at least the legal the attorneys
 
05:12:58.708 --> 05:12:58.718 align:start position:0%
on it trying to do the right thing
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
understanding what the right thing is
 
05:13:01.750 --> 05:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
and i think the courts are in the same
 
05:13:03.510 --> 05:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
situation if they get a pleading that
 
05:13:05.350 --> 05:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
looks like it's an emergency someone's
 
05:13:07.350 --> 05:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
filed an emergency
 
05:13:09.910 --> 05:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know they can't take the risk of
 
05:13:12.470 --> 05:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
just saying okay never mind just go go
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
back with that other parent they have to
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
have a hearing on it and look at it and
 
05:13:17.830 --> 05:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
figure out what happened
 
05:13:20.310 --> 05:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
and it's it's unfortunate in some cases
 
05:13:21.990 --> 05:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
but we've all seen the really really
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
tragic cases
 
05:13:26.070 --> 05:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
that have gone wrong
 
05:13:27.830 --> 05:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
and you know that's that's what the
 
05:13:30.070 --> 05:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
courts are always trying to to weigh i
 
05:13:36.550 --> 05:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:38.788 --> 05:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
any further questions thank you very
 
05:13:41.430 --> 05:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thank you
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%

you've asked for two minutes
 
05:13:54.550 --> 05:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:58.150 --> 05:13:58.160 align:start position:0%

albrecht national new hampshire
 
05:14:25.520 --> 05:14:26.868 align:start position:0%
albrecht national new hampshire
um

05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:28.628 --> 05:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to point out to the
 
05:14:30.550 --> 05:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
committee first of all
 
05:14:32.708 --> 05:14:32.718 align:start position:0%
that just because something
 
05:14:33.830 --> 05:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
might have
 
05:14:36.150 --> 05:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
hurt me in my case
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's bad legislation
 
05:14:40.000 --> 05:14:41.270 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's bad legislation
and

05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:43.590 --> 05:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
briefly echoing back to
 
05:14:47.350 --> 05:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
my morning testimony on appeals
 
05:14:50.550 --> 05:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh in that exhibit
 
05:14:53.910 --> 05:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh was a finding by master dalpra
 
05:14:56.550 --> 05:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
that my attempt to correct his
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
bad order
 
05:14:59.910 --> 05:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
was harassing so he could have hurt me
 
05:15:01.110 --> 05:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:15:02.550 --> 05:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
but that's i think
 
05:15:05.110 --> 05:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
an issue of judges and not legislation
 
05:15:07.110 --> 05:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
so again just because it would have hurt
 
05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
me doesn't mean it's bad legislation i
 
05:15:11.990 --> 05:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
think it's good legislation
 
05:15:12.000 --> 05:15:13.110 align:start position:0%
think it's good legislation
um

05:15:13.110 --> 05:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:14.390 --> 05:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
i like it
 
05:15:17.430 --> 05:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think it goes far enough
 
05:15:19.670 --> 05:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh i just want to bring up one other
 
05:15:21.190 --> 05:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
problem i had
 
05:15:23.750 --> 05:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
where there was a witness in my case who
 
05:15:23.760 --> 05:15:24.628 align:start position:0%
where there was a witness in my case who
felt

05:15:24.628 --> 05:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
felt
 
05:15:27.830 --> 05:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
very intimidated because he was facing
 
05:15:31.430 --> 05:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
false criminal charges i was
 
05:15:31.440 --> 05:15:32.390 align:start position:0%
false criminal charges i was
also

05:15:32.390 --> 05:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
given false criminal charges
 
05:15:38.788 --> 05:15:38.798 align:start position:0%
and he was hoping to make it here today
 
05:15:41.350 --> 05:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
so i don't actually want to speak too
 
05:15:45.190 --> 05:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
much to that i just wanted to provide
 
05:15:47.670 --> 05:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
his police report for you while i'm here
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
because i already made copies
 
05:15:52.708 --> 05:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure he can follow up with
 
05:15:55.830 --> 05:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
any written testimony later
 
05:15:57.670 --> 05:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have on this if there's
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:15:59.990 --> 05:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:16:02.550 --> 05:16:02.560 align:start position:0%

05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:10.070 --> 05:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
so although ms gerard is not back um
 
05:16:12.628 --> 05:16:12.638 align:start position:0%

05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%

that's okay i just got
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
lost if uh
 
05:24:05.590 --> 05:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
just had it
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
if somebody just gives me there is
 
05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
nothing to add there's nothing to pass
 
05:24:11.628 --> 05:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
out if somebody just hands me a copy of
 
05:24:13.990 --> 05:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
1458 i can do it
 
05:24:18.230 --> 05:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
no 12 53 12 53
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am thank you
 
05:24:20.638 --> 05:24:22.310 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am thank you
okay

05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:24:25.270 --> 05:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow parents to choose
 
05:24:27.270 --> 05:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
the counselors
 
05:24:27.280 --> 05:24:28.470 align:start position:0%
the counselors
because

05:24:28.470 --> 05:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:24:33.270 --> 05:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
kids are assigned by judges counseling
 
05:24:35.590 --> 05:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
many on many occasions
 
05:24:35.600 --> 05:24:36.948 align:start position:0%
many on many occasions
and

05:24:36.948 --> 05:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:39.350 --> 05:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
the parents don't have any choice in who
 
05:24:41.110 --> 05:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
this counselor is
 
05:24:43.350 --> 05:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
and we really think that
 
05:24:45.110 --> 05:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
if you can get the parents if the
 
05:24:47.030 --> 05:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
parents agree
 
05:24:49.910 --> 05:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
they can suggest counselors of their own
 
05:24:49.920 --> 05:24:51.190 align:start position:0%
they can suggest counselors of their own
choice

05:24:51.190 --> 05:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
choice
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
and of course if they're going to
 
05:24:56.788 --> 05:24:56.798 align:start position:0%
not agree then after a certain amount of
 
05:24:59.190 --> 05:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
time the the judge would
 
05:25:02.628 --> 05:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
regain that uh prerogative to make the
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
choice of counselor
 
05:25:07.030 --> 05:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
what changes in the bill
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:25:10.788 --> 05:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
number one that the parents get to write
 
05:25:12.628 --> 05:25:12.638 align:start position:0%
get the right to choose
 
05:25:12.638 --> 05:25:13.830 align:start position:0%
get the right to choose
and

05:25:13.830 --> 05:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:16.868 --> 05:25:16.878 align:start position:0%
this is an old change that's
 
05:25:19.270 --> 05:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
that should have been written years ago
 
05:25:22.230 --> 05:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
because they tried in previous laws
 
05:25:25.030 --> 05:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
travis previous rsas
 
05:25:26.868 --> 05:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
to direct
 
05:25:26.878 --> 05:25:28.548 align:start position:0%
to direct
payment

05:25:28.548 --> 05:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
payment
 
05:25:30.868 --> 05:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
in selecting a counselor they would
 
05:25:32.548 --> 05:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
accept the old
 
05:25:34.868 --> 05:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
terminology was accept direct payment
 
05:25:36.310 --> 05:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:25:36.320 --> 05:25:37.750 align:start position:0%
from the
provider

05:25:37.750 --> 05:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh because that was the best wording
 
05:25:41.190 --> 05:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
they could come up with so that they
 
05:25:42.070 --> 05:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:25:44.470 --> 05:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
honoring the parents
 
05:25:46.708 --> 05:25:46.718 align:start position:0%
insurance so that they would not be
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
paying out of pocket
 
05:25:48.480 --> 05:25:49.270 align:start position:0%
paying out of pocket
um

05:25:49.270 --> 05:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:51.590 --> 05:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
but they're actually the most current
 
05:25:53.670 --> 05:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
terminology one of our representatives
 
05:25:55.270 --> 05:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
as a
 
05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
retired md and so he said it should be
 
05:26:01.270 --> 05:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
instead of accepts direct payment from
 
05:26:04.788 --> 05:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
they are a participating provider
 
05:26:06.788 --> 05:26:06.798 align:start position:0%
in the party's health insurance
 
05:26:08.548 --> 05:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
this is already in
 
05:26:11.110 --> 05:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
in rsa that you're supposed to try to
 
05:26:11.120 --> 05:26:13.030 align:start position:0%
in rsa that you're supposed to try to
accommodate

05:26:13.030 --> 05:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
05:26:15.590 --> 05:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
families medical insurance
 
05:26:18.150 --> 05:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
but right now
 
05:26:20.548 --> 05:26:20.558 align:start position:0%
from all the cases that i have heard
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh parents
 
05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
get told who they're going to take their
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
child to
 
05:26:27.510 --> 05:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
and they don't have any choice in who
 
05:26:28.948 --> 05:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
this person is
 
05:26:32.628 --> 05:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
and lots of times it's out of pocket
 
05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
and that goes for the parents as well as
 
05:26:37.510 --> 05:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
the children so it's one more
 
05:26:40.788 --> 05:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
debilitating financial burden of being
 
05:26:43.990 --> 05:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:45.190 --> 05:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
05:26:49.590 --> 05:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:51.990 --> 05:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
05:26:55.270 --> 05:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your time
 
05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
and it hasn't come to an end yet
 
05:27:08.708 --> 05:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
so next i'll call katrina heinrich
 
05:27:11.030 --> 05:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
you've asked for three minutes
 
05:27:15.030 --> 05:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
we're asking that you squish it a little
 
05:27:19.590 --> 05:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:21.830 --> 05:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
you've done a great job
 
05:27:21.840 --> 05:27:22.788 align:start position:0%
you've done a great job
okay

05:27:22.788 --> 05:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
i try to eliminate if you've already
 
05:27:26.548 --> 05:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
heard it what's the point
 
05:27:26.558 --> 05:27:28.628 align:start position:0%
heard it what's the point
um

05:27:28.628 --> 05:27:28.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:32.150 --> 05:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:34.470 --> 05:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know we know counseling has numerous
 
05:27:34.480 --> 05:27:35.670 align:start position:0%
you know we know counseling has numerous
issues

05:27:35.670 --> 05:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:27:38.070 --> 05:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
some of the biggest ones is that
 
05:27:40.390 --> 05:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
children that are already in counseling
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
maybe you have a proactive parent
 
05:27:45.110 --> 05:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
they're getting pulled from those
 
05:27:49.270 --> 05:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:51.670 --> 05:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
and as representative gay said billing
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
is an issue
 
05:27:55.030 --> 05:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
frequently going to therapists who don't
 
05:27:56.470 --> 05:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a license they're
 
05:27:56.480 --> 05:27:57.590 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a license they're
getting

05:27:57.590 --> 05:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
getting
 
05:27:59.750 --> 05:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
billing codes that don't exist so they
 
05:28:01.190 --> 05:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
can't really bill for it so they're
 
05:28:04.150 --> 05:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
having to pay cash out of pocket
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
i think this is a familiar talk topic
 
05:28:09.270 --> 05:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
that we talked about in 2020
 
05:28:11.830 --> 05:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
with that said
 
05:28:13.910 --> 05:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
i think there are some things that could
 
05:28:19.670 --> 05:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:21.190 --> 05:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
i think we should add something to the
 
05:28:24.708 --> 05:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:26.390 --> 05:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
any existing patient provider
 
05:28:29.350 --> 05:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
relationship shall remain intact
 
05:28:31.590 --> 05:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
any existing provider evaluation and or
 
05:28:34.070 --> 05:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
diagnosis within one year time frame
 
05:28:37.830 --> 05:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
shall be accepted as current information
 
05:28:39.350 --> 05:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the court shall accept the
 
05:28:41.910 --> 05:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
professional conclusion as fact
 
05:28:43.750 --> 05:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
if a child has been in therapy for more
 
05:28:45.910 --> 05:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
than a year or consistently receiving
 
05:28:48.548 --> 05:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
treatment from a specific provider
 
05:28:51.670 --> 05:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
that provider and diagnosis shall be
 
05:28:54.070 --> 05:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
considered current
 
05:28:55.990 --> 05:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
such a relationship shall continue as
 
05:28:58.470 --> 05:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
long as considered necessary by the
 
05:28:58.480 --> 05:29:00.150 align:start position:0%
long as considered necessary by the
provider

05:29:00.150 --> 05:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:29:02.310 --> 05:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
selection of a provider shall not be
 
05:29:04.070 --> 05:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
contingent upon the sole discretion of
 
05:29:06.868 --> 05:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
the policy holding parent by default
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
both parties must be in agreement with
 
05:29:11.510 --> 05:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
provider and insurance
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
the court shall not order counseling and
 
05:29:16.070 --> 05:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
therapy services unless medically
 
05:29:19.030 --> 05:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
indicated and not as a mechanism to
 
05:29:22.070 --> 05:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
advance one party's cause over another
 
05:29:25.350 --> 05:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
the court shall also not make medically
 
05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary inquiries or interventions
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
um i refer back which what what happened
 
05:29:33.270 --> 05:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
to my middle child um all the children
 
05:29:35.030 --> 05:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
had already been evaluated they were all
 
05:29:37.110 --> 05:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
considered to be
 
05:29:38.868 --> 05:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
excellent students well-respected
 
05:29:38.878 --> 05:29:39.910 align:start position:0%
excellent students well-respected
students

05:29:39.910 --> 05:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:29:41.990 --> 05:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh and above level
 
05:29:42.000 --> 05:29:43.350 align:start position:0%
uh and above level
however

05:29:43.350 --> 05:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
once the case started being flipped um
 
05:29:47.670 --> 05:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
the first thing they did was they tried
 
05:29:49.350 --> 05:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
checking the middle child into a psych
 
05:29:51.910 --> 05:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
ward with no reason i got calls from the
 
05:29:53.910 --> 05:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
police coming to pick up the child this
 
05:29:57.510 --> 05:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:59.910 --> 05:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
the child then gets pulled by a
 
05:30:01.750 --> 05:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
self-inserted guardian light and who has
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
not been reappointed to the case
 
05:30:07.990 --> 05:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
and he comes to me and tells me
 
05:30:09.510 --> 05:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
that if i ever want to see my children
 
05:30:11.990 --> 05:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
again because he is going to take them
 
05:30:14.230 --> 05:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
that i have to comply with who he has
 
05:30:16.628 --> 05:30:16.638 align:start position:0%
chosen he has an existing relationship
 
05:30:19.350 --> 05:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
with this provider he used them for his
 
05:30:22.150 --> 05:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
case and they are known to do specific
 
05:30:24.708 --> 05:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
therapies that are not in the best
 
05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
interest of the child
 
05:30:28.868 --> 05:30:28.878 align:start position:0%
the billing on that there was some that
 
05:30:31.030 --> 05:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
was cash there was some that was not at
 
05:30:33.030 --> 05:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
the time i was not wise enough to really
 
05:30:35.750 --> 05:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
be paying attention to the billing codes
 
05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
that is a huge issue
 
05:30:38.868 --> 05:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
so i think when we're looking at
 
05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
something like this i thinking the
 
05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
additives to it is probably
 
05:30:47.670 --> 05:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
a way to make the bill
 
05:30:49.990 --> 05:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
better not necessarily to make it more
 
05:30:51.910 --> 05:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
complicated but i'm looking to find a
 
05:30:53.510 --> 05:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
way to make it
 
05:30:55.430 --> 05:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps a little
 
05:30:57.510 --> 05:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
better so it actually has
 
05:30:59.590 --> 05:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
a very thorough purpose
 
05:31:01.830 --> 05:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
and that there is account ability which
 
05:31:03.830 --> 05:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
is what is lacking throughout the family
 
05:31:03.840 --> 05:31:04.948 align:start position:0%
is what is lacking throughout the family
court

05:31:04.948 --> 05:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
court
 
05:31:06.310 --> 05:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm not going to give you
 
05:31:08.390 --> 05:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
any more examples
 
05:31:10.070 --> 05:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
you definitely
 
05:31:11.670 --> 05:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
understand this case the only thing i
 
05:31:13.510 --> 05:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
will add is my daughter that
 
05:31:15.190 --> 05:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned this morning due to
 
05:31:18.628 --> 05:31:18.638 align:start position:0%
severe ptsd could not be here
 
05:31:20.390 --> 05:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
as much as she wanted to
 
05:31:22.150 --> 05:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
she did want me to convey the simple
 
05:31:24.548 --> 05:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
fact that had she not been moved she
 
05:31:27.350 --> 05:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have this ptsd she wouldn't be
 
05:31:29.270 --> 05:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
in the situation she is in
 
05:31:31.510 --> 05:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire's court
 
05:31:33.910 --> 05:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
failed all three children specifically
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
her she wound up with
 
05:31:37.910 --> 05:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
medical incapabilities that were
 
05:31:39.750 --> 05:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
physical that could have been prevented
 
05:31:42.628 --> 05:31:42.638 align:start position:0%
and then she wound up with mental
 
05:31:45.270 --> 05:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
all preventable and all with the only
 
05:31:48.230 --> 05:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
parent advocating for the child
 
05:31:51.190 --> 05:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
05:31:53.910 --> 05:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:57.840 --> 05:31:58.868 align:start position:0%

anything else
 
05:32:24.788 --> 05:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:32.150 --> 05:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:32.160 --> 05:32:35.350 align:start position:0%
 
bat

05:32:35.350 --> 05:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you you've asked for three minutes
 
05:32:37.840 --> 05:32:39.430 align:start position:0%
thank you you've asked for three minutes
yes

05:32:39.430 --> 05:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:32:45.110 --> 05:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:46.628 --> 05:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:32:48.150 --> 05:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
05:32:50.390 --> 05:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify before you
 
05:32:52.868 --> 05:32:52.878 align:start position:0%
today each of you as our elected policy
 
05:32:54.390 --> 05:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
makers have the greatest ability to
 
05:32:56.310 --> 05:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
reform outdated laws to better protect
 
05:32:58.390 --> 05:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
children and families of new hampshire
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
my name is gail drobat although my
 
05:33:03.430 --> 05:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
own family is intact i advocate for
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
other parents
 
05:33:06.788 --> 05:33:06.798 align:start position:0%
that have been abused by the new
 
05:33:08.868 --> 05:33:08.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire family court system
 
05:33:12.150 --> 05:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
i come before you in support of hb 1253
 
05:33:14.150 --> 05:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
i believe this is imperative a counselor
 
05:33:16.390 --> 05:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
ordered by the court of their choosing
 
05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
in my opinion allows the court
 
05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
affiliated therapists to be biased from
 
05:33:22.150 --> 05:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
the onset of therapy
 
05:33:24.150 --> 05:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
it is also imperative that each
 
05:33:26.150 --> 05:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
therapist in court involved proceedings
 
05:33:27.990 --> 05:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
at minimum are credentialed in family
 
05:33:29.990 --> 05:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
systems therapy a therapy that can
 
05:33:32.948 --> 05:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
assess diagnose and treat the symptoms
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
that recognizes the breakdown in the
 
05:33:37.030 --> 05:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
family otherwise these therapists are
 
05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
getting it wrong a lot of the times
 
05:33:41.750 --> 05:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
inside with one parent
 
05:33:43.830 --> 05:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
again one of the fathers previously
 
05:33:46.310 --> 05:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned was forced to sign on with the
 
05:33:48.948 --> 05:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
mug a therapist of the mother's choosing
 
05:33:50.390 --> 05:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
believed to be recommended by the
 
05:33:53.430 --> 05:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem that therapist allied
 
05:33:54.628 --> 05:33:54.638 align:start position:0%
with the mother
 
05:33:56.708 --> 05:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
did not include dad in the process made
 
05:33:59.270 --> 05:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
unfavored assessments that was dictated
 
05:34:01.830 --> 05:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
by the mother this information is in
 
05:34:03.910 --> 05:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
email correspondence this therapist
 
05:34:05.590 --> 05:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
again was court ordered to provide
 
05:34:07.590 --> 05:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
billing and insurance records to the
 
05:34:07.600 --> 05:34:08.628 align:start position:0%
billing and insurance records to the
parties

05:34:08.628 --> 05:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
parties
 
05:34:11.590 --> 05:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
in a september 2020 court order
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
to date the counselor is in contempt of
 
05:34:16.390 --> 05:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
that court order and the court defies
 
05:34:18.868 --> 05:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
making her
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
present those documents
 
05:34:22.390 --> 05:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
she states she doesn't have them
 
05:34:25.110 --> 05:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
although her ethical codes dictate that
 
05:34:27.830 --> 05:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
she is to maintain those
 
05:34:29.430 --> 05:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
for seven years after the age of
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
majority so
 
05:34:32.548 --> 05:34:32.558 align:start position:0%
there should be no reason that she
 
05:34:34.948 --> 05:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't have those documents and
 
05:34:37.510 --> 05:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
the court now is making the father pay
 
05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
attorney fees to opposing counsel
 
05:34:42.708 --> 05:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
because she's defied that court order
 
05:34:44.948 --> 05:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
and he wants the records
 
05:34:44.958 --> 05:34:45.990 align:start position:0%
and he wants the records
so

05:34:45.990 --> 05:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:48.628 --> 05:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
it's imperative that
 
05:34:49.910 --> 05:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
05:34:52.628 --> 05:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
therapists need to be chosen by parents
 
05:34:53.670 --> 05:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
and not
 
05:34:55.990 --> 05:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
court officials
 
05:34:58.230 --> 05:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
because i feel they're choosing their
 
05:34:58.240 --> 05:35:00.628 align:start position:0%
because i feel they're choosing their
peers

05:35:00.628 --> 05:35:00.638 align:start position:0%
peers
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
that aren't qualified
 
05:35:04.830 --> 05:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
in the breakdown of the family
 
05:35:07.830 --> 05:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much
 
05:35:11.430 --> 05:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:13.590 --> 05:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for your
 
05:35:13.600 --> 05:35:14.868 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for your
time

05:35:14.868 --> 05:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
and with that that's our whoops wait a
 
05:35:17.280 --> 05:35:18.868 align:start position:0%
and with that that's our whoops wait a
minute

05:35:18.868 --> 05:35:18.878 align:start position:0%
minute
 
05:35:18.878 --> 05:35:32.868 align:start position:0%
minute
oops

05:35:32.868 --> 05:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:37.990 --> 05:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:40.548 --> 05:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:43.830 --> 05:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm dan itza and i regard
 
05:35:45.670 --> 05:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
reside in the
 
05:35:47.510 --> 05:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
city of manchester
 
05:35:47.520 --> 05:35:48.548 align:start position:0%
city of manchester
um

05:35:48.548 --> 05:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:51.350 --> 05:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
first a technical correction to the bill
 
05:35:54.788 --> 05:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh roman numeral three line four
 
05:35:57.110 --> 05:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
the first word parents
 
05:35:59.590 --> 05:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
that should be parties
 
05:36:02.708 --> 05:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
the way this is written the parent the
 
05:36:04.708 --> 05:36:04.718 align:start position:0%
parties would have the
 
05:36:07.270 --> 05:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
power to choose their counselor the
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
counselor for their children but not
 
05:36:11.830 --> 05:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
their own counselor
 
05:36:14.070 --> 05:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
and very often the parents are included
 
05:36:16.788 --> 05:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
in the counseling requirements so that
 
05:36:19.350 --> 05:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
there's just that word change to
 
05:36:21.830 --> 05:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
make the law correct
 
05:36:25.670 --> 05:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
beyond that i want to advocate for the
 
05:36:27.350 --> 05:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
power of the parties to choose the
 
05:36:27.360 --> 05:36:29.430 align:start position:0%
power of the parties to choose the
counselor

05:36:29.430 --> 05:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
05:36:31.270 --> 05:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
our counselors
 
05:36:31.280 --> 05:36:32.310 align:start position:0%
our counselors
um

05:36:32.310 --> 05:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:36.390 --> 05:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
very often in the instances that i have
 
05:36:38.788 --> 05:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
observed where the cases have gone
 
05:36:41.670 --> 05:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
sideways where they become complex cases
 
05:36:43.990 --> 05:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
there is a pattern where you have a
 
05:36:44.000 --> 05:36:45.030 align:start position:0%
there is a pattern where you have a
judge

05:36:45.030 --> 05:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
judge
 
05:36:46.390 --> 05:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
a gal
 
05:36:49.990 --> 05:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
and a counselor and you see that
 
05:36:51.990 --> 05:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
triumvirate repeated
 
05:36:55.510 --> 05:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
on multiple occasions in multiple cases
 
05:36:59.350 --> 05:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
and it appears to be at least in my
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
opinion a cottage industry
 
05:37:04.390 --> 05:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that these counselors are
 
05:37:07.110 --> 05:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
making life decisions for families
 
05:37:08.708 --> 05:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
the families need to be
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
in control of whom their counselors are
 
05:37:12.958 --> 05:37:14.310 align:start position:0%
in control of whom their counselors are
um

05:37:14.310 --> 05:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:17.190 --> 05:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's vitally necessary i'd be
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:23.670 --> 05:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:25.750 --> 05:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
i see none thank you very much for your
 
05:37:25.760 --> 05:37:28.788 align:start position:0%
i see none thank you very much for your
time

05:37:28.788 --> 05:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:31.030 --> 05:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
and with that i will close the hearing
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:52.878 --> 05:37:55.110 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:37:55.110 --> 05:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:56.868 --> 05:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
representative gay do you have a pink
 
05:38:04.788 --> 05:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:04.798 --> 05:38:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:38:07.430 --> 05:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:09.750 --> 05:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
you will hand them to my able assistant
 
05:38:44.948 --> 05:38:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:47.510 --> 05:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll open the hearing on
 
05:38:51.110 --> 05:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 1199
 
05:38:54.230 --> 05:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
and it's 3 38.
 
05:38:56.150 --> 05:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:38:58.230 --> 05:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
all your patience in dealing with so
 
05:38:58.240 --> 05:38:59.110 align:start position:0%
all your patience in dealing with so
many

05:38:59.110 --> 05:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
many
 
05:39:02.390 --> 05:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:04.948 --> 05:39:04.958 align:start position:0%
house bill 1199 deals with such an
 
05:39:06.390 --> 05:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
important issue
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
that we have a judge who has come to
 
05:39:11.910 --> 05:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
plead her case
 
05:39:14.788 --> 05:39:14.798 align:start position:0%
i'm here because as a person who got
 
05:39:17.670 --> 05:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
involved in family court through victims
 
05:39:20.628 --> 05:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
of domestic abuse
 
05:39:22.868 --> 05:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
i am particularly concerned about the
 
05:39:24.788 --> 05:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
effects on children
 
05:39:27.030 --> 05:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
as you all are
 
05:39:29.590 --> 05:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
and the testimony this pink testimony is
 
05:39:32.628 --> 05:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
not from the mother this is from the 15
 
05:39:34.150 --> 05:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
year old daughter
 
05:39:36.070 --> 05:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
who had to endure
 
05:39:38.150 --> 05:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
five years of
 
05:39:41.350 --> 05:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy
 
05:39:43.990 --> 05:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sending you or giving you all
 
05:39:46.390 --> 05:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
the many many articles
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
um on
 
05:39:50.230 --> 05:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy but one of the
 
05:39:52.390 --> 05:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
real strong points is
 
05:39:54.310 --> 05:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
you can't you can
 
05:39:56.948 --> 05:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
unify you can reunify people who were
 
05:39:59.350 --> 05:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
unified before
 
05:40:01.670 --> 05:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
but to call it reunification if those
 
05:40:04.230 --> 05:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
people had no relationship or had a very
 
05:40:06.070 --> 05:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
hostile relationship that was totally
 
05:40:06.080 --> 05:40:08.310 align:start position:0%
hostile relationship that was totally
different

05:40:08.310 --> 05:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:40:08.320 --> 05:40:09.270 align:start position:0%
different
the

05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:40:11.430 --> 05:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
i thought it was so important
 
05:40:13.750 --> 05:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
that this girl decided that she really
 
05:40:16.948 --> 05:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to tell you what it was like
 
05:40:20.230 --> 05:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
because it's nowhere it's not anything
 
05:40:22.230 --> 05:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
like counseling that you've ever heard
 
05:40:23.910 --> 05:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
of and that's why most professional
 
05:40:25.910 --> 05:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
counselors have never heard of
 
05:40:29.110 --> 05:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy because it has no
 
05:40:29.120 --> 05:40:30.390 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy because it has no
training

05:40:30.390 --> 05:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
training
 
05:40:33.030 --> 05:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
it has no certification
 
05:40:36.230 --> 05:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
it has no coverage by insurance so when
 
05:40:39.350 --> 05:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
people are ordered to go through it
 
05:40:42.070 --> 05:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
they get to pay out of their pocket the
 
05:40:47.510 --> 05:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
150 to 350 dollars per hour for it so it
 
05:40:51.270 --> 05:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
also impoverishes people besides in the
 
05:40:53.910 --> 05:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
case of domestic abuse
 
05:40:57.350 --> 05:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
it forces children our spouses to sit
 
05:40:59.510 --> 05:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
there in the same room
 
05:41:02.470 --> 05:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
with their abuser
 
05:41:03.830 --> 05:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it takes
 
05:41:06.868 --> 05:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
in by law it's very difficult to prove
 
05:41:06.878 --> 05:41:08.150 align:start position:0%
in by law it's very difficult to prove
abuse

05:41:08.150 --> 05:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
05:41:11.110 --> 05:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
so even though it happens and we have
 
05:41:12.868 --> 05:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:41:15.670 --> 05:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
centers around the state to help victims
 
05:41:17.190 --> 05:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
05:41:18.868 --> 05:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
it happens a lot
 
05:41:20.868 --> 05:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
and i have learned
 
05:41:23.670 --> 05:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday last week i heard back
 
05:41:27.750 --> 05:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
from doc uh attorney barry gold's
 
05:41:32.470 --> 05:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:35.350 --> 05:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's not goldsmith oh
 
05:41:38.470 --> 05:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
you can see why i'm really an unusual
 
05:41:40.628 --> 05:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
unusual uh politician since i can't
 
05:41:44.788 --> 05:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
remember words and names but um
 
05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
is it goldstein
 
05:41:48.628 --> 05:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
yes it's goldstein and he's written
 
05:41:52.390 --> 05:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
several books and uh i actually
 
05:41:54.230 --> 05:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
did print
 
05:41:54.240 --> 05:41:55.110 align:start position:0%
did print
uh

05:41:55.110 --> 05:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:41:56.390 --> 05:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
i'll have to
 
05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
have to find it because somehow it
 
05:42:00.708 --> 05:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
didn't make it into my
 
05:42:04.310 --> 05:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
my bag i guess i'll just send it to you
 
05:42:07.030 --> 05:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
because in his web page
 
05:42:10.230 --> 05:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:14.628 --> 05:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
in his webpage he lists 12 things that
 
05:42:17.270 --> 05:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the 1970s people just assumed were
 
05:42:17.280 --> 05:42:18.708 align:start position:0%
in the 1970s people just assumed were
facts

05:42:18.708 --> 05:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
facts
 
05:42:18.718 --> 05:42:19.510 align:start position:0%
facts
and

05:42:19.510 --> 05:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:42:22.628 --> 05:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
since then we've had a lot of research
 
05:42:25.830 --> 05:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
to refute those and explain better how
 
05:42:29.350 --> 05:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
you identify domestic abuse
 
05:42:30.868 --> 05:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
you know how it started out as just
 
05:42:33.190 --> 05:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
bruises but then we realize it's much
 
05:42:36.150 --> 05:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
more extensive than that
 
05:42:38.310 --> 05:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
but i will send that to you because it
 
05:42:42.868 --> 05:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
was extremely extremely educational
 
05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
but he's written
 
05:42:47.110 --> 05:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
at least three books
 
05:42:49.350 --> 05:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
so i'll i will send that to you but
 
05:42:52.070 --> 05:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
meanwhile the pink page is the
 
05:42:52.080 --> 05:42:53.110 align:start position:0%
meanwhile the pink page is the
um

05:42:53.110 --> 05:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:56.310 --> 05:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
is the testimony from a 15 year old who
 
05:42:58.628 --> 05:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
says in here she's actually written to
 
05:43:01.270 --> 05:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
courts before and of course nothing
 
05:43:04.070 --> 05:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
happened as a result of that but it made
 
05:43:06.230 --> 05:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
her feel better that she was
 
05:43:08.390 --> 05:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
trying to give herself a voice
 
05:43:10.390 --> 05:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
so please read that
 
05:43:11.430 --> 05:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
the change this this law we had lots of
 
05:43:14.878 --> 05:43:17.350 align:start position:0%
the change this this law we had lots of
people

05:43:17.350 --> 05:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:43:19.830 --> 05:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
offer what they thought was a best way
 
05:43:22.070 --> 05:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
to state this
 
05:43:23.910 --> 05:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm personally not against family
 
05:43:25.990 --> 05:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
counseling at all
 
05:43:28.948 --> 05:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
i think that's a really useful tool and
 
05:43:31.110 --> 05:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
when children have been
 
05:43:34.070 --> 05:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
swayed by one parent or the other
 
05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
are bribed we all know we don't like
 
05:43:38.948 --> 05:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
that we really want somebody who's
 
05:43:41.190 --> 05:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
impartial but caring
 
05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
to try to do an analysis
 
05:43:46.470 --> 05:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
of the children's situation of the
 
05:43:49.190 --> 05:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
parent situation and work as a family
 
05:43:51.990 --> 05:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
system to bring the best result that
 
05:43:54.868 --> 05:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:57.430 --> 05:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
however what's happening right now with
 
05:44:00.230 --> 05:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy is they're pretty
 
05:44:03.510 --> 05:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
much following that's creator
 
05:44:05.510 --> 05:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
opinion richard gardner
 
05:44:07.510 --> 05:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
who liked to be called a doctor but he
 
05:44:09.190 --> 05:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
didn't have patience
 
05:44:11.990 --> 05:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
and uh he had some really strange
 
05:44:14.230 --> 05:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
opinions like
 
05:44:16.310 --> 05:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse of children really wasn't
 
05:44:19.350 --> 05:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse and reporting it was more
 
05:44:22.628 --> 05:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
damaging to the child than the actual
 
05:44:22.638 --> 05:44:24.948 align:start position:0%
damaging to the child than the actual
acts

05:44:24.948 --> 05:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
acts
 
05:44:26.628 --> 05:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
that was
 
05:44:26.638 --> 05:44:28.230 align:start position:0%
that was
um

05:44:28.230 --> 05:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:31.190 --> 05:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
he has a very strong following because
 
05:44:33.350 --> 05:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
rich abusers loved him
 
05:44:36.310 --> 05:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that has taken over
 
05:44:38.470 --> 05:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
as a credible
 
05:44:41.750 --> 05:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
credible argument in american courts in
 
05:44:43.190 --> 05:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
british courts
 
05:44:45.030 --> 05:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
in australian courts
 
05:44:48.788 --> 05:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
meanwhile councillors real genuine trade
 
05:44:52.390 --> 05:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
trained certified counselors say this is
 
05:44:53.670 --> 05:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
not true
 
05:44:54.788 --> 05:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:44:54.798 --> 05:44:55.750 align:start position:0%
this is
uh

05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:44:57.590 --> 05:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
they don't say hogwash they use other
 
05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
words just meaning it is not legitimate
 
05:45:02.470 --> 05:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
and is extremely damaging to children
 
05:45:05.190 --> 05:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
who have been abused to be put in front
 
05:45:07.030 --> 05:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
of a counselor who's going to tell them
 
05:45:10.150 --> 05:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
that they it's they need to make a
 
05:45:12.470 --> 05:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
peace with this parent who has abused
 
05:45:12.480 --> 05:45:13.910 align:start position:0%
peace with this parent who has abused
them

05:45:13.910 --> 05:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:45:16.150 --> 05:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
so the wording here doesn't say anything
 
05:45:18.150 --> 05:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
negative about
 
05:45:20.310 --> 05:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
unifying in a family
 
05:45:23.430 --> 05:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
what it says is they are
 
05:45:25.030 --> 05:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
the court shall go give due
 
05:45:28.150 --> 05:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
consideration to selecting a counselor
 
05:45:30.948 --> 05:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
who is a participating provider in the
 
05:45:32.788 --> 05:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
party's health insurance
 
05:45:35.430 --> 05:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
the money does count you know people do
 
05:45:37.430 --> 05:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
need to be protected that way
 
05:45:39.990 --> 05:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
any therapy to unify a family with
 
05:45:40.000 --> 05:45:41.270 align:start position:0%
any therapy to unify a family with
counseling

05:45:41.270 --> 05:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
05:45:44.070 --> 05:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
shall be provided by a mental health
 
05:45:44.080 --> 05:45:45.350 align:start position:0%
shall be provided by a mental health
therapist

05:45:45.350 --> 05:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
05:45:48.470 --> 05:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
certified or licensed by the state of
 
05:45:51.270 --> 05:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and trained in family
 
05:45:51.280 --> 05:45:52.548 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and trained in family
systems

05:45:52.548 --> 05:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
systems
 
05:45:54.548 --> 05:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
who will first evaluate the family
 
05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
members to determine if such therapy is
 
05:45:57.680 --> 05:45:59.190 align:start position:0%
members to determine if such therapy is
appropriate

05:45:59.190 --> 05:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:46:00.628 --> 05:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
whether or not the children are covered
 
05:46:02.708 --> 05:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
by health insurance that's a legalese
 
05:46:06.628 --> 05:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
thing dealing with previous laws
 
05:46:10.150 --> 05:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
so this says to unify a family
 
05:46:12.948 --> 05:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
you need to have a trained counselor and
 
05:46:15.270 --> 05:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
right now people who have a shingle out
 
05:46:18.150 --> 05:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
that says i'm a reunification therapist
 
05:46:20.230 --> 05:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
do not have to be they don't have to
 
05:46:22.470 --> 05:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
have any training in family counseling
 
05:46:24.628 --> 05:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
they may be a counselor maybe in weight
 
05:46:27.990 --> 05:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
control or something but if you read
 
05:46:29.590 --> 05:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
i hope i've already sent it to you if i
 
05:46:31.750 --> 05:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
haven't i'll resend it testimony from
 
05:46:33.590 --> 05:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
five different people who have
 
05:46:33.600 --> 05:46:34.948 align:start position:0%
five different people who have
experienced

05:46:34.948 --> 05:46:34.958 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
05:46:37.910 --> 05:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
devastating effects of being
 
05:46:40.628 --> 05:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
pushed into reunification therapy
 
05:46:43.510 --> 05:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
with a person who's
 
05:46:45.510 --> 05:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
who doesn't doesn't care what has
 
05:46:48.868 --> 05:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
happened and if you're uh been abused
 
05:46:51.510 --> 05:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's tough you need to make peace with
 
05:46:54.470 --> 05:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
this parent and the children are told
 
05:46:56.470 --> 05:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
if you don't
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to give custody of you to
 
05:47:00.548 --> 05:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
that person
 
05:47:03.110 --> 05:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
so that you can imagine what fear these
 
05:47:04.868 --> 05:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
children live in
 
05:47:07.030 --> 05:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
once they've been talked and she's very
 
05:47:09.590 --> 05:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
good about talking what it was like
 
05:47:11.750 --> 05:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
and she had to go through it five years
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
and the amazing thing was
 
05:47:16.788 --> 05:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
she and her sister finally at the end of
 
05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
five years
 
05:47:20.470 --> 05:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
they told the council they went in there
 
05:47:23.030 --> 05:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
and they said
 
05:47:25.190 --> 05:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're not coming anymore
 
05:47:28.150 --> 05:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
so she was horrified and she said they
 
05:47:30.150 --> 05:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
said they had to stay so they stayed the
 
05:47:33.030 --> 05:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
whole hour looking at the floor which i
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
thought was amazing gumption
 
05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
for kids who had gone through this for
 
05:47:38.708 --> 05:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
five years
 
05:47:41.510 --> 05:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
so that's my story
 
05:47:45.750 --> 05:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:53.110 --> 05:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:27.190 --> 05:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:29.990 --> 05:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
again i'm katrina heinrich
 
05:48:31.910 --> 05:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
on this particular one
 
05:48:33.990 --> 05:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
and betty did an excellent job of
 
05:48:34.000 --> 05:48:35.190 align:start position:0%
and betty did an excellent job of
conveying

05:48:35.190 --> 05:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
conveying
 
05:48:37.110 --> 05:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
so many of the stories some that i've
 
05:48:39.430 --> 05:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
participated in
 
05:48:39.440 --> 05:48:41.110 align:start position:0%
participated in
uh

05:48:41.110 --> 05:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:48:44.948 --> 05:48:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:46.788 --> 05:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
is critical to
 
05:48:49.430 --> 05:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
kind of some of the pieces
 
05:48:52.470 --> 05:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
that the honorable itza spoke to for the
 
05:48:52.480 --> 05:48:54.070 align:start position:0%
that the honorable itza spoke to for the
trifecta

05:48:54.070 --> 05:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
trifecta
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
tactic that's being used
 
05:48:59.110 --> 05:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
05:49:01.350 --> 05:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
again in courts across the nation not
 
05:49:03.030 --> 05:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
just new hampshire
 
05:49:06.310 --> 05:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
the gals are specifically
 
05:49:10.948 --> 05:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:12.230 --> 05:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have the ability to go
 
05:49:14.230 --> 05:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of their jobs or in
 
05:49:14.240 --> 05:49:16.070 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of their jobs or in
function

05:49:16.070 --> 05:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
function
 
05:49:18.230 --> 05:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
to move the case from one direction to
 
05:49:20.628 --> 05:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
another post-divorce
 
05:49:22.390 --> 05:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
that can be occurred by all these
 
05:49:24.788 --> 05:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
different avenues that they stack up one
 
05:49:24.798 --> 05:49:26.230 align:start position:0%
different avenues that they stack up one
being

05:49:26.230 --> 05:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:49:29.030 --> 05:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
this reunification therapy experiment
 
05:49:30.708 --> 05:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
and that's the only word i have for it
 
05:49:32.628 --> 05:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's an experiment because all i have
 
05:49:32.638 --> 05:49:33.590 align:start position:0%
it's an experiment because all i have
heard

05:49:33.590 --> 05:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:49:35.110 --> 05:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
is the kids that have been in it and the
 
05:49:37.510 --> 05:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
kids that my daughter has met with
 
05:49:39.430 --> 05:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
is they become very confused they don't
 
05:49:44.310 --> 05:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:46.628 --> 05:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
the only thing i can really summarize my
 
05:49:48.470 --> 05:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
feeling on this is
 
05:49:51.910 --> 05:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
that in my experience the title
 
05:49:55.190 --> 05:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
or whatever you call the action
 
05:49:58.628 --> 05:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
for a type of certified
 
05:49:58.638 --> 05:50:00.230 align:start position:0%
for a type of certified
therapy

05:50:00.230 --> 05:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
05:50:03.750 --> 05:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
is only relevant when it is a proper
 
05:50:06.788 --> 05:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
billable diagnosis
 
05:50:09.510 --> 05:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
that it is provided by a neutral
 
05:50:11.910 --> 05:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
certified practitioner
 
05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
who can
 
05:50:16.470 --> 05:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
justify their findings that it is
 
05:50:19.590 --> 05:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
medically necessary that there is a
 
05:50:22.150 --> 05:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
reason component for it there must be
 
05:50:24.548 --> 05:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
something that brings us back into the
 
05:50:24.558 --> 05:50:26.070 align:start position:0%
something that brings us back into the
courtroom

05:50:26.070 --> 05:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
courtroom
 
05:50:28.150 --> 05:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
where judges are allowing even ordering
 
05:50:31.110 --> 05:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
it and practicing in the trifecta
 
05:50:34.310 --> 05:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
if it isn't necessary why are we doing
 
05:50:39.270 --> 05:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:41.750 --> 05:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's just a very valid question that i
 
05:50:44.390 --> 05:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
think needs to be explored
 
05:50:46.788 --> 05:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
and that is all i have on that
 
05:50:50.470 --> 05:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:54.230 --> 05:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none next we'll call anna goulet
 
05:50:54.240 --> 05:50:56.390 align:start position:0%
seeing none next we'll call anna goulet
zimmerman

05:50:56.390 --> 05:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
zimmerman
 
05:51:03.510 --> 05:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:05.430 --> 05:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee i'm
 
05:51:07.190 --> 05:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
not sure if i should keep introducing
 
05:51:08.868 --> 05:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
myself but i will in case the record's
 
05:51:10.628 --> 05:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh split up i am announcing for the
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
record i am anna goulet zimmerman i
 
05:51:14.070 --> 05:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
practice law at the law office of
 
05:51:15.590 --> 05:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
manning and zimmerman in manchester new
 
05:51:17.030 --> 05:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i am also a member of the
 
05:51:19.510 --> 05:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association for justice
 
05:51:19.520 --> 05:51:20.548 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association for justice
um

05:51:20.548 --> 05:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:22.230 --> 05:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
i think if i'm understanding the
 
05:51:23.990 --> 05:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
modifications or the amendment that was
 
05:51:25.830 --> 05:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
proposed as it was read in by the
 
05:51:25.840 --> 05:51:27.030 align:start position:0%
proposed as it was read in by the
sponsor

05:51:27.030 --> 05:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
05:51:29.910 --> 05:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
i am less concerned but i also don't
 
05:51:31.750 --> 05:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
know i just don't understand why this is
 
05:51:33.590 --> 05:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
necessary i mean one if there's no
 
05:51:35.110 --> 05:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
training or certification or anything
 
05:51:37.270 --> 05:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
like that specific to reunification
 
05:51:37.280 --> 05:51:38.788 align:start position:0%
like that specific to reunification
therapy

05:51:38.788 --> 05:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
05:51:41.750 --> 05:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
how do we prohibit it um
 
05:51:43.910 --> 05:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
but this also this notion of what is
 
05:51:46.070 --> 05:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
medically necessary i can think of a ton
 
05:51:47.830 --> 05:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
of situations and i'll give you a couple
 
05:51:50.628 --> 05:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
of quick examples where it is definitely
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
without a doubt in the best
 
05:51:53.910 --> 05:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
interest of the child to try to have a
 
05:51:56.788 --> 05:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
positive relationship with both parents
 
05:51:58.150 --> 05:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if we call it
 
05:52:00.070 --> 05:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy i'm going to put
 
05:52:03.670 --> 05:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
that in air quotes um or if we call it
 
05:52:05.030 --> 05:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
how do we improve the relationship
 
05:52:06.310 --> 05:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
between the children and the parents
 
05:52:08.788 --> 05:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
therapy but it amounts to the same thing
 
05:52:10.868 --> 05:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
i represented a young young father once
 
05:52:12.788 --> 05:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
who had a little kid who he didn't even
 
05:52:15.430 --> 05:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
know had been was his child
 
05:52:18.788 --> 05:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
um when when dcyf came in took the child
 
05:52:20.788 --> 05:52:20.798 align:start position:0%
from mom they started being questions
 
05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
about well who where's whose dad where's
 
05:52:22.798 --> 05:52:24.150 align:start position:0%
about well who where's whose dad where's
dad

05:52:24.150 --> 05:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
dad
 
05:52:26.470 --> 05:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
and that was when he found out that he
 
05:52:27.910 --> 05:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
might have a child
 
05:52:31.030 --> 05:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
and he was great he came back he went to
 
05:52:32.628 --> 05:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
counseling he learned about kids and
 
05:52:34.150 --> 05:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
there was a process
 
05:52:35.590 --> 05:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
because he had no you know we weren't
 
05:52:37.430 --> 05:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
going to just take this child who was a
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
couple years old at the time and
 
05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
overnight move her in with a family with
 
05:52:43.030 --> 05:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
someone she didn't know
 
05:52:45.430 --> 05:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
but there was a process to forge that
 
05:52:47.030 --> 05:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
relationship and it ended up being a
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
great relationship and last i knew he
 
05:52:50.548 --> 05:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
was a great dad
 
05:52:53.510 --> 05:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
um you see this through dcyf where
 
05:52:54.868 --> 05:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
you've got parents that have drug or
 
05:52:56.470 --> 05:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol problems they have an
 
05:52:58.868 --> 05:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get clean and be
 
05:53:00.868 --> 05:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
reunified with their children
 
05:53:03.270 --> 05:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
and are we saying we're not gonna do
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
that in family court if someone actually
 
05:53:07.190 --> 05:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
had a problem
 
05:53:08.948 --> 05:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
and they have fixed that problem we're
 
05:53:10.230 --> 05:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
just going to say never mind your
 
05:53:11.430 --> 05:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
children don't want to see you we're not
 
05:53:13.110 --> 05:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
even going to try to make sure you can
 
05:53:16.390 --> 05:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
have a positive relationship with them
 
05:53:18.230 --> 05:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
i know there's questions on alienation
 
05:53:20.230 --> 05:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
does it happen does it not happen why
 
05:53:21.830 --> 05:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
does it happen but there's a variety of
 
05:53:23.750 --> 05:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
situations where throughout the divorce
 
05:53:27.670 --> 05:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
to process the children are
 
05:53:27.680 --> 05:53:28.868 align:start position:0%
to process the children are
upset

05:53:28.868 --> 05:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
upset
 
05:53:30.470 --> 05:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
reluctant to spend time with another
 
05:53:33.270 --> 05:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
parent there's some issue going on and
 
05:53:35.190 --> 05:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
certainly and i didn't catch all of the
 
05:53:36.948 --> 05:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
amendment but i would urge you to
 
05:53:39.270 --> 05:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
certainly not pass anything that
 
05:53:41.270 --> 05:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
prohibits the courts from encouraging
 
05:53:42.788 --> 05:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
the children to go through counseling
 
05:53:44.070 --> 05:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to have a positive
 
05:53:46.310 --> 05:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
relationship with both their parents
 
05:53:48.150 --> 05:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your time any
 
05:53:48.160 --> 05:53:50.390 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your time any
questions

05:53:50.390 --> 05:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:53:52.868 --> 05:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much next
 
05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:05.270 --> 05:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
again just for the record dana albrecht
 
05:54:06.868 --> 05:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
nashua new hampshire
 
05:54:09.270 --> 05:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
echoing what was just said i know this
 
05:54:12.470 --> 05:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
has been through a couple different revs
 
05:54:16.070 --> 05:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
um i would urge you to pass something
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh similar to the latest
 
05:54:21.270 --> 05:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh requiring
 
05:54:24.470 --> 05:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
that a family systems therapist
 
05:54:27.030 --> 05:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh support a positive
 
05:54:28.868 --> 05:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
and healthy relationship with both
 
05:54:28.878 --> 05:54:30.150 align:start position:0%
and healthy relationship with both
parents

05:54:30.150 --> 05:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:54:30.160 --> 05:54:31.430 align:start position:0%
parents
absent

05:54:31.430 --> 05:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
absent
 
05:54:33.590 --> 05:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh clear and convincing evidence in a
 
05:54:35.190 --> 05:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
court order that that's not in the
 
05:54:37.190 --> 05:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
child's best interest
 
05:54:38.708 --> 05:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
because i think that's what we're really
 
05:54:40.070 --> 05:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
looking here
 
05:54:40.080 --> 05:54:40.868 align:start position:0%
looking here
is

05:54:40.868 --> 05:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:54:43.750 --> 05:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
a good positive relationship with both
 
05:54:43.760 --> 05:54:44.868 align:start position:0%
a good positive relationship with both
parents

05:54:44.868 --> 05:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:54:46.868 --> 05:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
unless we've got a good re really good
 
05:54:46.878 --> 05:54:48.070 align:start position:0%
unless we've got a good re really good
reason

05:54:48.070 --> 05:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
reason
 
05:54:50.150 --> 05:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
why we shouldn't have that
 
05:54:50.160 --> 05:54:52.070 align:start position:0%
why we shouldn't have that
um

05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:54.390 --> 05:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm a little less hung up on wording
 
05:54:56.150 --> 05:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
as some of the other folks but i think
 
05:54:59.350 --> 05:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
we should focus on what it is we want
 
05:55:01.510 --> 05:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
rather than what it is we
 
05:55:04.150 --> 05:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
are maybe trying to avoid
 
05:55:06.788 --> 05:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
um this one is particularly near and
 
05:55:08.708 --> 05:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
dear to my heart
 
05:55:10.628 --> 05:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh up until april
 
05:55:10.638 --> 05:55:12.708 align:start position:0%
uh up until april
2016

05:55:12.708 --> 05:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
2016
 
05:55:14.788 --> 05:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
uh i was actually probably the primary
 
05:55:17.110 --> 05:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
parent in my household
 
05:55:18.788 --> 05:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
just to remind the committee from my
 
05:55:21.190 --> 05:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
testimony on shared parenting i'm the
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
father of four children
 
05:55:23.040 --> 05:55:24.868 align:start position:0%
father of four children
to

05:55:24.868 --> 05:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:55:28.150 --> 05:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
older boys to younger girls
 
05:55:30.390 --> 05:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
the older kids kind of is
 
05:55:40.628 --> 05:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:43.510 --> 05:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh but i do have a poor relationship
 
05:55:45.590 --> 05:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
with my daughters
 
05:55:45.600 --> 05:55:46.868 align:start position:0%
with my daughters
and

05:55:46.868 --> 05:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:55:49.590 --> 05:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
i don't need some crazy
 
05:55:53.030 --> 05:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
unlicensed unrecognized
 
05:55:56.548 --> 05:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
person or therapy to fix that
 
05:55:57.750 --> 05:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
i need
 
05:56:00.628 --> 05:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
a really solid
 
05:56:02.868 --> 05:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
licensed marriage
 
05:56:06.628 --> 05:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
family child family systems therapist
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
who is willing to work with both parents
 
05:56:12.628 --> 05:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
to help our kids
 
05:56:15.190 --> 05:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
put this back together again
 
05:56:17.510 --> 05:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
and there's been some real challenges
 
05:56:17.520 --> 05:56:19.510 align:start position:0%
and there's been some real challenges
there

05:56:19.510 --> 05:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:56:19.520 --> 05:56:21.750 align:start position:0%
there
uh

05:56:21.750 --> 05:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:56:21.760 --> 05:56:23.590 align:start position:0%
uh
since

05:56:23.590 --> 05:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:56:23.600 --> 05:56:24.390 align:start position:0%
since
the

05:56:24.390 --> 05:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:56:24.400 --> 05:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
the
um

05:56:25.430 --> 05:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:28.150 --> 05:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
hearing where master del pra
 
05:56:30.548 --> 05:56:30.558 align:start position:0%
basically said who the f cares
 
05:56:32.628 --> 05:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
about my testimony
 
05:56:35.750 --> 05:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
and that my kids were morons
 
05:56:35.760 --> 05:56:36.788 align:start position:0%
and that my kids were morons
um

05:56:36.788 --> 05:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:39.110 --> 05:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
actually the resulting order from that
 
05:56:41.750 --> 05:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
hearing is still in effect right now
 
05:56:43.510 --> 05:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
we filed a motion to vacate but the
 
05:56:45.190 --> 05:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
court hasn't heard it
 
05:56:48.470 --> 05:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
and it gave mom sole decision making
 
05:56:50.868 --> 05:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
authority to suck the counselor which
 
05:56:53.910 --> 05:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
probably speaks to the last bill as well
 
05:56:56.868 --> 05:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
and i've actually had serious issues
 
05:56:58.628 --> 05:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
with that person
 
05:57:00.150 --> 05:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to blame them too much i
 
05:57:02.470 --> 05:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
think they're young and inexperienced
 
05:57:04.230 --> 05:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
but i've heard multiple conflicting
 
05:57:06.310 --> 05:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
stories from her
 
05:57:10.150 --> 05:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
why she will only communicate with mom
 
05:57:13.110 --> 05:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
or only communicate with mom's counsel
 
05:57:13.120 --> 05:57:13.990 align:start position:0%
or only communicate with mom's counsel
and

05:57:13.990 --> 05:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:15.270 --> 05:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
not me
 
05:57:17.270 --> 05:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
and even a story from her that there's a
 
05:57:19.110 --> 05:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
court order preventing her from
 
05:57:19.120 --> 05:57:20.628 align:start position:0%
court order preventing her from
communicating

05:57:20.628 --> 05:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
communicating
 
05:57:21.670 --> 05:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
with me
 
05:57:23.510 --> 05:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
so i think if we can just kind of really
 
05:57:25.670 --> 05:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
clean this up as to what's allowed and
 
05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
what's not
 
05:57:28.788 --> 05:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
kind of echoing
 
05:57:30.310 --> 05:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
almost the theme of the day on
 
05:57:30.320 --> 05:57:32.548 align:start position:0%
almost the theme of the day on
discretion

05:57:32.548 --> 05:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
05:57:35.510 --> 05:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
that would be a good thing
 
05:57:35.520 --> 05:57:36.548 align:start position:0%
that would be a good thing
uh

05:57:36.548 --> 05:57:36.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:57:38.230 --> 05:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
i would further add this has been
 
05:57:38.240 --> 05:57:41.350 align:start position:0%
i would further add this has been
exacerbated

05:57:41.350 --> 05:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:41.360 --> 05:57:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
since

05:57:43.030 --> 05:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:57:45.030 --> 05:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know kathleen sternenberg sent the
 
05:57:47.350 --> 05:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
kids to california they've moved a lot
 
05:57:49.030 --> 05:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
so they've been from hollis new
 
05:57:51.030 --> 05:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire to
 
05:57:53.270 --> 05:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
sierra to pasadena california to sierra
 
05:57:55.030 --> 05:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
madre california
 
05:57:57.430 --> 05:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
currently to east china
 
05:57:57.440 --> 05:57:58.788 align:start position:0%
currently to east china
michigan

05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
michigan
 
05:57:59.990 --> 05:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
and so when you put the whole
 
05:58:01.670 --> 05:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
multi-state thing
 
05:58:03.750 --> 05:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
into the mix it can get even more
 
05:58:03.760 --> 05:58:05.430 align:start position:0%
into the mix it can get even more
confusing

05:58:05.430 --> 05:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
05:58:05.440 --> 05:58:06.868 align:start position:0%
confusing
um

05:58:06.868 --> 05:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:10.070 --> 05:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
to that end i would just have one
 
05:58:11.590 --> 05:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
concern about the languages written
 
05:58:13.910 --> 05:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
where it says new hampshire
 
05:58:16.470 --> 05:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
um maybe take this offline i just want
 
05:58:18.708 --> 05:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're not causing
 
05:58:21.110 --> 05:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction problems
 
05:58:22.708 --> 05:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
if kids are in
 
05:58:24.868 --> 05:58:24.878 align:start position:0%
another state and
 
05:58:26.948 --> 05:58:26.958 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's an easy fix if that would
 
05:58:28.310 --> 05:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
be an issue
 
05:58:31.110 --> 05:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
um i think that's it uh if there's any
 
05:58:31.120 --> 05:58:34.470 align:start position:0%
um i think that's it uh if there's any
questions

05:58:34.470 --> 05:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:36.868 --> 05:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:58:46.070 --> 05:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:55.190 --> 05:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:56.788 --> 05:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
05:58:58.390 --> 05:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
05:59:01.510 --> 05:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
again i support this bill there is no
 
05:59:02.868 --> 05:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice for
 
05:59:04.708 --> 05:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy
 
05:59:07.110 --> 05:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
again i believe at minimal it should be
 
05:59:08.628 --> 05:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
family systems therapy where they
 
05:59:10.230 --> 05:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
recognize the breakdown in the family
 
05:59:15.430 --> 05:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:17.670 --> 05:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
also if there's allegations of abuse or
 
05:59:19.350 --> 05:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
neglect in my opinion there would need
 
05:59:21.430 --> 05:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
to be a certified therapist well-versed
 
05:59:23.030 --> 05:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
in childhood trauma attachment
 
05:59:27.270 --> 05:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:29.830 --> 05:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
and figure out why one child is allied
 
05:59:30.868 --> 05:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
with another
 
05:59:33.110 --> 05:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
parent and
 
05:59:37.110 --> 05:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
figure out where that's coming from okay
 
05:59:38.548 --> 05:59:38.558 align:start position:0%
that's my and i actually have some
 
05:59:40.470 --> 05:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
information to give you guys to read on
 
05:59:42.628 --> 05:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
great that
 
05:59:46.788 --> 05:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:50.470 --> 05:59:50.480 align:start position:0%

06:01:02.948 --> 06:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
court judge does
 
06:01:04.868 --> 06:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
in the three different divisions of the
 
06:01:06.310 --> 06:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire circuit court we have the
 
06:01:08.150 --> 06:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
family division the district division
 
06:01:11.350 --> 06:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
and the probate division
 
06:01:13.190 --> 06:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
almost all of the circuit court judges
 
06:01:15.750 --> 06:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
sit at least in two of those divisions
 
06:01:17.750 --> 06:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
at any given time usually family and
 
06:01:17.760 --> 06:01:19.110 align:start position:0%
at any given time usually family and
district

06:01:19.110 --> 06:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
district
 
06:01:20.708 --> 06:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
probate divisions don't appear in every
 
06:01:22.548 --> 06:01:22.558 align:start position:0%
courthouse in the state there are fewer
 
06:01:24.708 --> 06:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
of them but i actually sit in a
 
06:01:25.990 --> 06:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
courthouse that does have a probate
 
06:01:28.150 --> 06:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
division so from time to time i'm also
 
06:01:29.910 --> 06:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
called upon to preside over those
 
06:01:29.920 --> 06:01:31.030 align:start position:0%
called upon to preside over those
matters

06:01:31.030 --> 06:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
matters
 
06:01:33.670 --> 06:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
but in the family division we hear
 
06:01:36.070 --> 06:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
of course divorce and parenting cases
 
06:01:37.830 --> 06:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
but also a number of other types of
 
06:01:40.948 --> 06:01:40.958 align:start position:0%
cases on a daily basis and those include
 
06:01:43.270 --> 06:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
child support domestic violence
 
06:01:45.350 --> 06:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
child abuse and neglect cases
 
06:01:47.830 --> 06:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights cases
 
06:01:47.840 --> 06:01:49.510 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights cases
adoptions

06:01:49.510 --> 06:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
adoptions
 
06:01:49.520 --> 06:01:51.190 align:start position:0%
adoptions
and

06:01:51.190 --> 06:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:01:53.350 --> 06:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
guardianship of minors
 
06:01:56.070 --> 06:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
and then at the same time we're hearing
 
06:01:57.830 --> 06:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
cases in the district division of our
 
06:01:57.840 --> 06:01:59.190 align:start position:0%
cases in the district division of our
courthouses

06:01:59.190 --> 06:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
courthouses
 
06:02:01.590 --> 06:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
for criminal arraignments please bail
 
06:02:05.190 --> 06:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
hearings trials civil litigation
 
06:02:07.110 --> 06:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
including small claims hearings landlord
 
06:02:10.470 --> 06:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
and tenant disputes stalking petitions
 
06:02:12.390 --> 06:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
so in a given day
 
06:02:14.708 --> 06:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
any of us might have a mixed docket we
 
06:02:16.628 --> 06:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
talked about that a little bit last week
 
06:02:18.470 --> 06:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
what that means the docket is just the
 
06:02:20.788 --> 06:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
hearings that we have on every day from
 
06:02:24.230 --> 06:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
8 to 12 and then from one to four
 
06:02:25.750 --> 06:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
usually there are
 
06:02:27.910 --> 06:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
six to eight hearings in the morning 30
 
06:02:30.230 --> 06:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
minutes each no time in between
 
06:02:32.230 --> 06:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
maybe six in the afternoon if they're
 
06:02:34.070 --> 06:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
longer hearings there are fewer of them
 
06:02:35.270 --> 06:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
of course
 
06:02:37.990 --> 06:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
but we're very busy in the circuit court
 
06:02:39.270 --> 06:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:02:41.830 --> 06:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
have been for quite some time and we try
 
06:02:44.948 --> 06:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
to hear as many cases as we can
 
06:02:47.110 --> 06:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
because we are so busy
 
06:02:49.590 --> 06:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
also at any time throughout the day we
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
have walk-ins with domestic violence
 
06:02:54.310 --> 06:02:54.320 align:start position:0%

landlord and tenant petitions
 
06:02:57.440 --> 06:02:59.350 align:start position:0%
landlord and tenant petitions
and

06:02:59.350 --> 06:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:02.390 --> 06:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
at night we take calls 24 7 and on
 
06:03:05.030 --> 06:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
weekends 365 days a year
 
06:03:06.708 --> 06:03:06.718 align:start position:0%

06:03:08.548 --> 06:03:08.558 align:start position:0%

warrants
 
06:03:13.030 --> 06:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
dcyf may have an emergency request to
 
06:03:14.548 --> 06:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
remove a child
 
06:03:16.788 --> 06:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
or the police may have a juvenile that
 
06:03:18.070 --> 06:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
they wish to
 
06:03:19.990 --> 06:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
seek to detain or have in custody and
 
06:03:21.990 --> 06:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
need us to help them determine where
 
06:03:23.910 --> 06:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
where that child should go if a parent
 
06:03:25.990 --> 06:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
isn't available for instance
 
06:03:26.000 --> 06:03:26.948 align:start position:0%
isn't available for instance
um

06:03:26.948 --> 06:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:26.958 --> 06:03:28.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:03:28.230 --> 06:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:03:30.548 --> 06:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
that's what we do in the circuit court
 
06:03:32.230 --> 06:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis
 
06:03:32.240 --> 06:03:33.190 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis
um

06:03:33.190 --> 06:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:35.830 --> 06:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
and we do the best we can because we're
 
06:03:38.708 --> 06:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
statutorily authorized of course to
 
06:03:40.310 --> 06:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
apply the law to the facts that are
 
06:03:42.708 --> 06:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
presented to us
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
and in the parenting and divorce realm
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
of course that's rsa 461 a that's our
 
06:03:49.670 --> 06:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities
 
06:03:49.680 --> 06:03:51.110 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities
statute

06:03:51.110 --> 06:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:03:52.948 --> 06:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
in the very beginning of that statute it
 
06:03:54.788 --> 06:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
sets out the policy of the state of new
 
06:03:57.430 --> 06:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire and it is to
 
06:03:59.910 --> 06:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
support the frequent continuing contact
 
06:04:03.110 --> 06:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
of a child with each parent unless it is
 
06:04:05.670 --> 06:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the child to do so
 
06:04:07.350 --> 06:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
and it sets out that we have to take
 
06:04:09.190 --> 06:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
into consideration safety issues that
 
06:04:12.390 --> 06:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
may be present for the child or a parent
 
06:04:12.400 --> 06:04:13.590 align:start position:0%
may be present for the child or a parent
and

06:04:13.590 --> 06:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:15.510 --> 06:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
we have to obviously always be guided by
 
06:04:20.708 --> 06:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:23.430 --> 06:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
when we're faced with a parenting case
 
06:04:25.910 --> 06:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
or a divorce case that has a parenting
 
06:04:25.920 --> 06:04:27.270 align:start position:0%
or a divorce case that has a parenting
component

06:04:27.270 --> 06:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
component
 
06:04:29.510 --> 06:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
we have to help parties develop a
 
06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
parenting plan
 
06:04:33.430 --> 06:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's within the statute and it is in
 
06:04:36.470 --> 06:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
fact an eight-page document uh that is a
 
06:04:39.430 --> 06:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
roadmap for uh parents going forward how
 
06:04:40.948 --> 06:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
they're going to share and at you know
 
06:04:41.830 --> 06:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
their parental rights and
 
06:04:43.190 --> 06:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities with one another
 
06:04:45.110 --> 06:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
because of course
 
06:04:47.270 --> 06:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
at the outset every parent has the same
 
06:04:49.270 --> 06:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
rights as the other parent
 
06:04:51.270 --> 06:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
under the new hampshire constitution
 
06:04:54.310 --> 06:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
and we have to determine what happens if
 
06:04:56.548 --> 06:04:56.558 align:start position:0%
they cannot agree
 
06:04:57.750 --> 06:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
on how they're going to share those
 
06:04:59.350 --> 06:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
rights going forward they have a
 
06:05:01.270 --> 06:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
conflict with one another the parents do
 
06:05:03.030 --> 06:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
or a parent and a guardian if that's the
 
06:05:04.628 --> 06:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
case or what you may have in your
 
06:05:06.150 --> 06:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
particular case
 
06:05:07.670 --> 06:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:05:09.430 --> 06:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
we encourage in the first instance and
 
06:05:10.628 --> 06:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
it's part of the new hampshire state
 
06:05:12.628 --> 06:05:12.638 align:start position:0%
policy to do so that the parents can
 
06:05:14.150 --> 06:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
enter into a parenting plan together
 
06:05:16.070 --> 06:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
that they agree upon together
 
06:05:17.990 --> 06:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
we help them to do that if they can't do
 
06:05:20.310 --> 06:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
it on their own with mediators that we
 
06:05:22.150 --> 06:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
provide with case managers who work in
 
06:05:23.990 --> 06:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
the family division who help them
 
06:05:25.750 --> 06:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
prepare the forms they're not attorneys
 
06:05:25.760 --> 06:05:27.510 align:start position:0%
prepare the forms they're not attorneys
or

06:05:27.510 --> 06:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:05:30.070 --> 06:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
mediators but they can assist people who
 
06:05:32.230 --> 06:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
aren't represented by counsel to do you
 
06:05:34.070 --> 06:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
know some very difficult work that needs
 
06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
to be done because we request a lot of
 
06:05:35.760 --> 06:05:37.510 align:start position:0%
to be done because we request a lot of
forms

06:05:37.510 --> 06:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
forms
 
06:05:40.390 --> 06:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
and we also have along the way um
 
06:05:42.230 --> 06:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
something called neutral case evaluation
 
06:05:45.030 --> 06:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
which is free to the parties and we have
 
06:05:47.590 --> 06:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
a judge or a retired judge sit with the
 
06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
parties and act somewhat like a mediator
 
06:05:52.230 --> 06:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
but spend a few hours with them hear
 
06:05:54.310 --> 06:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
what their issues are in their case and
 
06:05:54.320 --> 06:05:55.110 align:start position:0%
what their issues are in their case and
help

06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
help
 
06:05:57.430 --> 06:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
by telling them what they as a judge if
 
06:05:58.948 --> 06:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
they were the judge on the case might
 
06:06:00.628 --> 06:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
order sometimes that helps parties to
 
06:06:03.510 --> 06:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
settle the case themselves
 
06:06:06.310 --> 06:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
and that's all a voluntary process
 
06:06:07.830 --> 06:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
the parties have to agree to participate
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
in that it's quite it's been quite
 
06:06:09.120 --> 06:06:10.868 align:start position:0%
in that it's quite it's been quite
successful

06:06:10.868 --> 06:06:10.878 align:start position:0%
successful
 
06:06:12.868 --> 06:06:12.878 align:start position:0%
i currently sit
 
06:06:14.628 --> 06:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
on the complex
 
06:06:17.190 --> 06:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
docket for region c of the of the state
 
06:06:19.590 --> 06:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire we have four regions
 
06:06:21.270 --> 06:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
regency is rockingham and stratfor
 
06:06:24.628 --> 06:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
counties and two years ago
 
06:06:26.470 --> 06:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
when judge foley
 
06:06:28.150 --> 06:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
stepped back from being the presiding
 
06:06:29.830 --> 06:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
judge of the complex family division
 
06:06:29.840 --> 06:06:31.830 align:start position:0%
judge of the complex family division
docket

06:06:31.830 --> 06:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
docket
 
06:06:33.830 --> 06:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
we split the case in the state rather
 
06:06:36.150 --> 06:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
into four regions and i became the
 
06:06:38.230 --> 06:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
presiding judge of the complex case
 
06:06:39.830 --> 06:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
docket for the family divisions of
 
06:06:41.510 --> 06:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
rockingham and stratfor counties all
 
06:06:42.628 --> 06:06:42.638 align:start position:0%
that means
 
06:06:44.390 --> 06:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
is that the judges who have these busy
 
06:06:46.150 --> 06:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
regular dockets in those counties if
 
06:06:47.590 --> 06:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
they're faced with a case that's
 
06:06:50.310 --> 06:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
particularly complex can request that it
 
06:06:52.948 --> 06:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
be transferred reassigned to my docket
 
06:06:54.470 --> 06:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
because i have
 
06:06:56.548 --> 06:06:56.558 align:start position:0%
more time and resources available i have
 
06:06:58.548 --> 06:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
a dedicated case manager
 
06:07:02.230 --> 06:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
i have a complex list of adr alternate
 
06:07:04.310 --> 06:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution mediators who have
 
06:07:04.320 --> 06:07:06.230 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution mediators who have
been

06:07:06.230 --> 06:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:07:09.830 --> 06:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
vetted and interviewed by the adr office
 
06:07:11.590 --> 06:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
at the administration administrative
 
06:07:13.270 --> 06:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
office of the courts
 
06:07:15.750 --> 06:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
to deal with complex issues
 
06:07:18.628 --> 06:07:18.638 align:start position:0%
and that's at no cost to the parties who
 
06:07:20.070 --> 06:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
are on my docket
 
06:07:23.350 --> 06:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
and um the complex cases generally fall
 
06:07:25.910 --> 06:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
into one of two categories the majority
 
06:07:28.150 --> 06:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
of them that i have presently
 
06:07:30.830 --> 06:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
are legally complex or they have large
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
financial interests and complex
 
06:07:36.628 --> 06:07:36.638 align:start position:0%
interests of that nature they may be
 
06:07:38.390 --> 06:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
they may involve
 
06:07:38.400 --> 06:07:39.510 align:start position:0%
they may involve
assets

06:07:39.510 --> 06:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
assets
 
06:07:41.910 --> 06:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
such as real estate in other countries
 
06:07:43.990 --> 06:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
in other jurisdictions
 
06:07:46.548 --> 06:07:46.558 align:start position:0%
conflict of laws issues across states
 
06:07:48.310 --> 06:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
closely held businesses that need to be
 
06:07:50.230 --> 06:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
allocated during in a divorce which can
 
06:07:52.868 --> 06:07:52.878 align:start position:0%
be quite complex tax issues
 
06:07:55.350 --> 06:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
real estate valuation issues
 
06:07:57.990 --> 06:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
requiring long trials i have mostly long
 
06:07:59.670 --> 06:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
trials on my docket and i have the time
 
06:08:01.990 --> 06:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
set aside to do that the regular dockets
 
06:08:05.030 --> 06:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
can't handle perhaps in the next
 
06:08:08.150 --> 06:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
year or so a five day a six day a 10 day
 
06:08:10.230 --> 06:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
trial but i can do that on my docket for
 
06:08:12.948 --> 06:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
those legally complex matters and the
 
06:08:15.750 --> 06:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
other complex type of case that i do see
 
06:08:17.830 --> 06:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
occasionally on my docket are those that
 
06:08:20.150 --> 06:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
have very high conflict difficult
 
06:08:22.788 --> 06:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
parenting issues such as those i'm sure
 
06:08:24.708 --> 06:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
you've been hearing about today they're
 
06:08:27.110 --> 06:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
very difficult cases of course there's a
 
06:08:29.430 --> 06:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
lot of emotion in in many aspects of
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
what we do in the circuit court but
 
06:08:33.270 --> 06:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
certainly in these cases and i
 
06:08:35.670 --> 06:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
understand it having presided over
 
06:08:38.390 --> 06:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
many many of them over the last 12 years
 
06:08:41.030 --> 06:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
i sat in manchester portsmouth
 
06:08:43.190 --> 06:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
dover rochester and now brentwood for
 
06:08:45.030 --> 06:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
the last two years
 
06:08:45.040 --> 06:08:45.910 align:start position:0%
the last two years
and

06:08:45.910 --> 06:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:49.110 --> 06:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
we do as i said what we can to apply the
 
06:08:50.868 --> 06:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
law and the policy of the state of new
 
06:08:52.948 --> 06:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire to the facts before us
 
06:08:55.430 --> 06:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we do have to do
 
06:08:59.430 --> 06:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
shifting now to to this house bill 1199
 
06:09:02.070 --> 06:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
is in some cases and i i just want to
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
again i can only speak about my
 
06:09:03.440 --> 06:09:04.628 align:start position:0%
again i can only speak about my
experience

06:09:04.628 --> 06:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
experience
 
06:09:04.638 --> 06:09:05.430 align:start position:0%
experience
but

06:09:05.430 --> 06:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:09:06.948 --> 06:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's rare
 
06:09:08.628 --> 06:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
first of all that i would order
 
06:09:10.470 --> 06:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
something that i
 
06:09:12.470 --> 06:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
would understand to be reunification
 
06:09:13.750 --> 06:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
counseling as you're hearing about it
 
06:09:13.760 --> 06:09:15.430 align:start position:0%
counseling as you're hearing about it
today

06:09:15.430 --> 06:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:09:17.190 --> 06:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
certainly we see many cases with
 
06:09:19.030 --> 06:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
counseling being ordered
 
06:09:21.430 --> 06:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
and it may be actually in many cases the
 
06:09:23.430 --> 06:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
parties or the children are already in
 
06:09:24.868 --> 06:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
counseling before they even appear
 
06:09:27.110 --> 06:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
before me in my courtroom
 
06:09:29.190 --> 06:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
and that's because the parents have have
 
06:09:30.788 --> 06:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
put them there they might have done that
 
06:09:32.470 --> 06:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
by agreement they might not have but
 
06:09:34.868 --> 06:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
that may already be in place
 
06:09:36.628 --> 06:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
if there is a particular issue in a case
 
06:09:38.548 --> 06:09:38.558 align:start position:0%
that makes it difficult for me to
 
06:09:40.390 --> 06:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
determine what is truly in this child's
 
06:09:42.868 --> 06:09:42.878 align:start position:0%
best interests because maybe there's a
 
06:09:44.948 --> 06:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
substance abuse issue in the case maybe
 
06:09:47.030 --> 06:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
mental health issues
 
06:09:49.350 --> 06:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
maybe the child is resisting or refusing
 
06:09:51.430 --> 06:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
to go with a parent and and we don't
 
06:09:53.670 --> 06:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
know what the cause of that is
 
06:09:55.750 --> 06:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not a child psychologist i don't
 
06:09:56.788 --> 06:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
have those
 
06:09:58.628 --> 06:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
those qualifications
 
06:10:00.708 --> 06:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
i may have two parents in front of me
 
06:10:03.270 --> 06:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
one that is absolutely adamant
 
06:10:06.548 --> 06:10:06.558 align:start position:0%
that um he or she is doing everything to
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
encourage that child to go and the other
 
06:10:10.788 --> 06:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
parent saying no you're not you're
 
06:10:13.270 --> 06:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
you're withholding the child uh you're
 
06:10:14.548 --> 06:10:14.558 align:start position:0%
in contempt
 
06:10:16.150 --> 06:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not doing what you
 
06:10:18.788 --> 06:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
need to do to comply with this order
 
06:10:21.350 --> 06:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
they may not have any evidence to show
 
06:10:21.360 --> 06:10:22.150 align:start position:0%
they may not have any evidence to show
me

06:10:22.150 --> 06:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
me
 
06:10:24.628 --> 06:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
that can help me decide what is actually
 
06:10:26.310 --> 06:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
going on here
 
06:10:29.590 --> 06:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
but that child may need to have a place
 
06:10:31.750 --> 06:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
to go and a counselor to talk to to talk
 
06:10:33.510 --> 06:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
those things through
 
06:10:36.470 --> 06:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
if i order counseling in a case
 
06:10:38.868 --> 06:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
i always first promote the parties to
 
06:10:40.868 --> 06:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
agree to who that counselor is going to
 
06:10:42.788 --> 06:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
be sometimes they have absolutely no
 
06:10:44.470 --> 06:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
idea and they need someone to help give
 
06:10:47.430 --> 06:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
them a suggestion sometimes well first i
 
06:10:49.510 --> 06:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
and again that the part of this that
 
06:10:51.510 --> 06:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
that talks about insurance
 
06:10:53.270 --> 06:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
i don't have an issue with because
 
06:10:55.110 --> 06:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
there's already written into the law the
 
06:10:56.628 --> 06:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
fact that we have to give to due
 
06:10:58.708 --> 06:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
consideration to the presence of
 
06:11:01.510 --> 06:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
insurance and whether or not a counselor
 
06:11:03.510 --> 06:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
is on someone's insurance we consider
 
06:11:05.670 --> 06:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
cost or at least i consider cost and i
 
06:11:07.830 --> 06:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
and my colleagues as well
 
06:11:09.990 --> 06:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
to the parties in many areas in these
 
06:11:12.548 --> 06:11:12.558 align:start position:0%
cases not just counseling but also if
 
06:11:13.910 --> 06:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to appoint a guardian ad
 
06:11:15.830 --> 06:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
litem we can no longer appoint a
 
06:11:17.430 --> 06:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem in a case in new
 
06:11:19.030 --> 06:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire if the parties cannot
 
06:11:21.270 --> 06:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrate and we get their financial
 
06:11:23.510 --> 06:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
affidavits and we get whatever evidence
 
06:11:25.350 --> 06:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
they give us tax returns pay stubs what
 
06:11:27.350 --> 06:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
have you of their income if they can't
 
06:11:29.030 --> 06:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrate an ability to privately pay
 
06:11:31.350 --> 06:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
for a guardian we can't appoint one we
 
06:11:33.030 --> 06:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
used to have a fund in new hampshire a
 
06:11:34.708 --> 06:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
gal fund
 
06:11:37.590 --> 06:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's no longer there and it was it was
 
06:11:39.430 --> 06:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
fantastic to have something to assist
 
06:11:41.430 --> 06:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
parties who needed that because in some
 
06:11:43.430 --> 06:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
cases a gal would be tremendously
 
06:11:46.310 --> 06:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
helpful a good qualified gal would be
 
06:11:49.030 --> 06:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
very helpful in a particular case
 
06:11:50.868 --> 06:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
but we can't appoint them now even in
 
06:11:52.470 --> 06:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
cases that need them and sometimes
 
06:11:54.868 --> 06:11:54.878 align:start position:0%
parties are are asking for them and if
 
06:11:56.548 --> 06:11:56.558 align:start position:0%
they can't afford it
 
06:11:58.150 --> 06:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no
 
06:12:00.708 --> 06:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
no resource there for us any longer but
 
06:12:02.548 --> 06:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
we consider cost and certainly when
 
06:12:03.990 --> 06:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
appointing a counselor ordering a
 
06:12:06.708 --> 06:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
counselor i should say
 
06:12:09.030 --> 06:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
what i do if they don't agree i ask who
 
06:12:10.948 --> 06:12:10.958 align:start position:0%
has the insurance if they have insurance
 
06:12:12.788 --> 06:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
if they do they may not know who's
 
06:12:14.548 --> 06:12:14.558 align:start position:0%
covered under their insurance i'll ask
 
06:12:16.070 --> 06:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
them to have a printout made of
 
06:12:17.430 --> 06:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
whoever's available under their
 
06:12:18.868 --> 06:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
insurance policy and share it with the
 
06:12:20.230 --> 06:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
other party they might both have
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
insurance they can exchange them
 
06:12:24.150 --> 06:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
if they still can't after they do their
 
06:12:26.310 --> 06:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
own research on who they'd like can't
 
06:12:26.320 --> 06:12:27.190 align:start position:0%
own research on who they'd like can't
agree

06:12:27.190 --> 06:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
agree
 
06:12:29.030 --> 06:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
i might propose that they seek the
 
06:12:30.788 --> 06:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
recommendations of their pediatrician
 
06:12:32.150 --> 06:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
show those lists to your child's
 
06:12:34.070 --> 06:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
pediatrician and see if the pediatrician
 
06:12:35.910 --> 06:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
can point you in a certain direction
 
06:12:37.670 --> 06:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
that he or she would recommend
 
06:12:39.270 --> 06:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
and choose that way
 
06:12:41.990 --> 06:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
if there can be no agreement and the
 
06:12:42.000 --> 06:12:42.868 align:start position:0%
if there can be no agreement and the
child

06:12:42.868 --> 06:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
child
 
06:12:44.708 --> 06:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
has a need for counseling and i feel
 
06:12:46.150 --> 06:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's in the best interest of the child
 
06:12:48.230 --> 06:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
to be in counseling
 
06:12:50.230 --> 06:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
then i ask each parent to propose a
 
06:12:53.030 --> 06:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
counselor and tell me why that counselor
 
06:12:55.110 --> 06:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
is the person he or she proposes and
 
06:12:56.470 --> 06:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
submit that we'll have a hearing i'll
 
06:12:58.150 --> 06:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
hear their respective positions and
 
06:13:00.150 --> 06:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately i need to decide
 
06:13:02.070 --> 06:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
but i do assure you that in my
 
06:13:04.390 --> 06:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
experience that any counselors that
 
06:13:04.400 --> 06:13:05.830 align:start position:0%
experience that any counselors that
have

06:13:05.830 --> 06:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:13:08.868 --> 06:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
been i and again
 
06:13:11.030 --> 06:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not usually selecting a counselor
 
06:13:12.628 --> 06:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
certainly if a party needs to be in
 
06:13:14.628 --> 06:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
counseling that party should pick his or
 
06:13:16.708 --> 06:13:16.718 align:start position:0%
her own counselor it's a very personal
 
06:13:16.718 --> 06:13:17.830 align:start position:0%
her own counselor it's a very personal
process

06:13:17.830 --> 06:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:13:19.750 --> 06:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
um and i i don't know that i've ever
 
06:13:22.310 --> 06:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
ordered a party to to go to a particular
 
06:13:22.320 --> 06:13:24.470 align:start position:0%
ordered a party to to go to a particular
counselor

06:13:24.470 --> 06:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
06:13:24.480 --> 06:13:25.670 align:start position:0%
counselor
if

06:13:25.670 --> 06:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:13:25.680 --> 06:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
if
if

06:13:26.470 --> 06:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:13:28.788 --> 06:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
a child needs a counselor again we
 
06:13:30.310 --> 06:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
promote agreement if there can't be
 
06:13:32.628 --> 06:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
agreement look to the pediatrician
 
06:13:34.628 --> 06:13:34.638 align:start position:0%
usually that's where they find the
 
06:13:34.638 --> 06:13:36.310 align:start position:0%
usually that's where they find the
recommendation

06:13:36.310 --> 06:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
06:13:36.320 --> 06:13:37.670 align:start position:0%
recommendation
but

06:13:37.670 --> 06:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:13:40.470 --> 06:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
in a very extreme circumstance and again
 
06:13:42.708 --> 06:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
i've only had a handful of these over
 
06:13:44.948 --> 06:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
the years even on my my current complex
 
06:13:44.958 --> 06:13:46.070 align:start position:0%
the years even on my my current complex
docket

06:13:46.070 --> 06:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
docket
 
06:13:48.788 --> 06:13:48.798 align:start position:0%
where there is a reunification protocol
 
06:13:51.030 --> 06:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
in place what that
 
06:13:54.070 --> 06:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
involves in my experience is each parent
 
06:13:56.150 --> 06:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
is in counseling and the child has a
 
06:13:56.160 --> 06:13:57.830 align:start position:0%
is in counseling and the child has a
counselor

06:13:57.830 --> 06:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
06:13:59.350 --> 06:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
and then there's a master family
 
06:13:59.360 --> 06:14:00.788 align:start position:0%
and then there's a master family
therapist

06:14:00.788 --> 06:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
06:14:02.070 --> 06:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
who is
 
06:14:05.190 --> 06:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
someone who has a master's if not a
 
06:14:05.200 --> 06:14:06.310 align:start position:0%
someone who has a master's if not a
doctorate

06:14:06.310 --> 06:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
doctorate
 
06:14:08.548 --> 06:14:08.558 align:start position:0%
in child clinical development
 
06:14:11.590 --> 06:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
or child clinical psychology
 
06:14:11.600 --> 06:14:12.470 align:start position:0%
or child clinical psychology
and

06:14:12.470 --> 06:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:14:15.270 --> 06:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
counseling psychology
 
06:14:16.230 --> 06:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
i heard
 
06:14:19.110 --> 06:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire certified and licensed
 
06:14:21.030 --> 06:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
mental health counselors
 
06:14:23.350 --> 06:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
that is something i see quite often in
 
06:14:25.830 --> 06:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
these cases
 
06:14:28.230 --> 06:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
i know of no one myself
 
06:14:28.240 --> 06:14:29.030 align:start position:0%
i know of no one myself
that

06:14:29.030 --> 06:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:14:30.708 --> 06:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
is involved in any of these cases that
 
06:14:32.708 --> 06:14:32.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't have those type of
 
06:14:32.718 --> 06:14:34.628 align:start position:0%
doesn't have those type of
qualifications

06:14:34.628 --> 06:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
06:14:37.190 --> 06:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
but again it's a very rare circumstance
 
06:14:39.030 --> 06:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
because a child is refusing to go with a
 
06:14:41.510 --> 06:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
parent it may be that
 
06:14:42.788 --> 06:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
and i heard
 
06:14:47.510 --> 06:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
mention of a case where perhaps a child
 
06:14:49.990 --> 06:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
may have been traumatized by the parent
 
06:14:52.788 --> 06:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
that they're refusing or resisting from
 
06:14:55.590 --> 06:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
i need to know that as the judge on the
 
06:14:57.990 --> 06:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
case if that's the reason that a child
 
06:15:00.390 --> 06:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
is truly resisting or refusing contact
 
06:15:02.150 --> 06:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
i am not going to order there to be
 
06:15:03.990 --> 06:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
contact with that parent because i have
 
06:15:06.150 --> 06:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
to take into consideration what's safe
 
06:15:08.070 --> 06:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
and and certainly what's in the child's
 
06:15:10.230 --> 06:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
best interests but sometimes we don't
 
06:15:11.510 --> 06:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
know that until the child's been
 
06:15:11.520 --> 06:15:14.470 align:start position:0%
know that until the child's been
evaluated

06:15:14.470 --> 06:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:16.390 --> 06:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
courts need all the resources available
 
06:15:18.390 --> 06:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
to us to help us with these very
 
06:15:21.270 --> 06:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
difficult cases
 
06:15:22.310 --> 06:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
we are
 
06:15:24.548 --> 06:15:24.558 align:start position:0%
truly concerned about what is in the
 
06:15:26.150 --> 06:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
best interest of these children and
 
06:15:28.628 --> 06:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
these families that come before us
 
06:15:31.510 --> 06:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i i agree
 
06:15:31.520 --> 06:15:32.230 align:start position:0%
and i i agree
with

06:15:32.230 --> 06:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:15:34.150 --> 06:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
the attorney that spoke earlier
 
06:15:34.160 --> 06:15:36.708 align:start position:0%
the attorney that spoke earlier
that

06:15:36.708 --> 06:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:39.270 --> 06:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
we want to help foster healthy strong
 
06:15:41.430 --> 06:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
relationships within families certainly
 
06:15:43.030 --> 06:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
when it's appropriate and in the child's
 
06:15:45.590 --> 06:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
best interest to do so again we take in
 
06:15:47.270 --> 06:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
whatever evidence we have available to
 
06:15:48.788 --> 06:15:48.798 align:start position:0%
us and
 
06:15:50.628 --> 06:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
if we don't know the root of the issue
 
06:15:52.788 --> 06:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
it could be a child's age the child
 
06:15:55.190 --> 06:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
could have separation anxiety could have
 
06:15:57.510 --> 06:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
developmental issues could have
 
06:15:59.750 --> 06:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh his or her own mental uh health
 
06:16:02.150 --> 06:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
issues that are causing this issue you
 
06:16:04.230 --> 06:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
know resisting or refusing the other
 
06:16:06.470 --> 06:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
parent if that child isn't being
 
06:16:08.708 --> 06:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
evaluated and treated for that
 
06:16:08.718 --> 06:16:09.750 align:start position:0%
evaluated and treated for that
um

06:16:09.750 --> 06:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:11.910 --> 06:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
then reunifying that child with the
 
06:16:13.830 --> 06:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
other parent isn't even going to be an
 
06:16:13.840 --> 06:16:15.030 align:start position:0%
other parent isn't even going to be an
option

06:16:15.030 --> 06:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
option
 
06:16:17.270 --> 06:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
and the cases that i have currently on
 
06:16:18.788 --> 06:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
my docket
 
06:16:21.830 --> 06:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i only have two or three
 
06:16:23.750 --> 06:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
two that actually have a reunification
 
06:16:26.948 --> 06:16:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:29.270 --> 06:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
they were agreed upon and proposed by
 
06:16:30.868 --> 06:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
06:16:32.948 --> 06:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
they wanted they bought into this
 
06:16:32.958 --> 06:16:34.470 align:start position:0%
they wanted they bought into this
process

06:16:34.470 --> 06:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:16:36.788 --> 06:16:36.798 align:start position:0%
one of the cases you know i can't speak
 
06:16:39.750 --> 06:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
to the facts of a pending case
 
06:16:41.590 --> 06:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
but i'll just tell you that in one such
 
06:16:42.948 --> 06:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
case um
 
06:16:45.190 --> 06:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
a father hasn't hasn't had contact with
 
06:16:47.670 --> 06:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
seeing his child in many years
 
06:16:47.680 --> 06:16:49.990 align:start position:0%
seeing his child in many years
and

06:16:49.990 --> 06:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:16:50.000 --> 06:16:51.430 align:start position:0%
and
there

06:16:51.430 --> 06:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
there are issues that the parents that
 
06:16:55.670 --> 06:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
cause the parents to not be able to
 
06:16:57.830 --> 06:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
agree upon anything
 
06:16:59.590 --> 06:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
and that's understandable that happens
 
06:17:02.470 --> 06:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
quite frequently in our cases before us
 
06:17:04.548 --> 06:17:04.558 align:start position:0%
but what they did agree to was that they
 
06:17:06.548 --> 06:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
would prefer to be in a therapeutic
 
06:17:08.628 --> 06:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
process that might have a long-term
 
06:17:11.270 --> 06:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
sustainable effect for this child
 
06:17:13.590 --> 06:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
than to be constantly in the courts and
 
06:17:15.830 --> 06:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
coming back to relitigate year after
 
06:17:19.670 --> 06:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
year until this child turns 18
 
06:17:22.230 --> 06:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that's what keeps the
 
06:17:23.910 --> 06:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of these cases in our court system
 
06:17:26.470 --> 06:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
a long time unfortunately the fact that
 
06:17:28.470 --> 06:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
that there hasn't been a sustainable
 
06:17:30.868 --> 06:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
solution to whatever the issue is that
 
06:17:33.110 --> 06:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
is causing this family to be hurting so
 
06:17:35.270 --> 06:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
and causing this child to not have a
 
06:17:38.390 --> 06:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
healthy relationship with both parents
 
06:17:40.788 --> 06:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
so a colleague of mine when i spoke with
 
06:17:42.390 --> 06:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
him about this
 
06:17:43.510 --> 06:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
bill said
 
06:17:45.510 --> 06:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
why would anyone want to take one of the
 
06:17:47.670 --> 06:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
very few arrows we have left in our
 
06:17:50.470 --> 06:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
quiver in terms of the few resources we
 
06:17:53.190 --> 06:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
have as circuit court judges to try and
 
06:17:56.070 --> 06:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
help children and help families in these
 
06:17:58.868 --> 06:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
very very difficult cases
 
06:18:02.310 --> 06:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
i have no agenda i have no
 
06:18:04.788 --> 06:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
desire to cause anyone to pay for
 
06:18:07.430 --> 06:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
something they can't afford or to be in
 
06:18:11.030 --> 06:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
a process that they don't believe in
 
06:18:13.270 --> 06:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
and so i attempt to
 
06:18:15.350 --> 06:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
have everyone agree at the outset
 
06:18:17.910 --> 06:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
in my cases if that can't happen again
 
06:18:19.430 --> 06:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
we have to come back to well what's in
 
06:18:21.110 --> 06:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
the child's best interest
 
06:18:23.350 --> 06:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
and one thing that we can't do
 
06:18:26.310 --> 06:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
because there is is case law the miller
 
06:18:28.868 --> 06:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
and todd case tells us what we can't do
 
06:18:31.670 --> 06:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
is if there's a case where it has been
 
06:18:34.070 --> 06:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
found that a parent is
 
06:18:36.628 --> 06:18:36.638 align:start position:0%
alienating a child against the other
 
06:18:36.638 --> 06:18:38.390 align:start position:0%
alienating a child against the other
parent

06:18:38.390 --> 06:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
parent
 
06:18:41.510 --> 06:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
and such that the child no longer wishes
 
06:18:43.670 --> 06:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
to have contact with another parent we
 
06:18:45.510 --> 06:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
can't just pick that child up and put
 
06:18:47.830 --> 06:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
that child with the other parent
 
06:18:50.150 --> 06:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
particularly if there are any
 
06:18:52.788 --> 06:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
allegations of abuse certainly
 
06:18:54.150 --> 06:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
particularly even if there aren't
 
06:18:56.070 --> 06:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence of any abuse but
 
06:18:57.750 --> 06:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
there are allegations and the child is
 
06:18:59.510 --> 06:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
resisting and refusing
 
06:19:02.230 --> 06:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
and it may be a belief that one child
 
06:19:03.590 --> 06:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
one parent's alienating the child from
 
06:19:05.110 --> 06:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
the other parent
 
06:19:07.350 --> 06:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
we can't do harm to the child we can't
 
06:19:09.670 --> 06:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
force the child we can't
 
06:19:11.190 --> 06:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
cause trauma to that child that may
 
06:19:12.788 --> 06:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
already have experienced trauma that's
 
06:19:14.948 --> 06:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to avoid doing we're
 
06:19:16.468 --> 06:19:16.478 align:start position:0%
trying to also
 
06:19:18.708 --> 06:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
promote frequent and continuing contact
 
06:19:20.070 --> 06:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
between a child and both parents because
 
06:19:21.190 --> 06:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's what the state of new hampshire
 
06:19:23.110 --> 06:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
tells us that we need to do when it's
 
06:19:24.868 --> 06:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate and in the child's best
 
06:19:26.868 --> 06:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
interest i know i
 
06:19:28.788 --> 06:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
i circled around there a little bit i
 
06:19:30.230 --> 06:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
touched on a bunch of things i know
 
06:19:31.830 --> 06:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
you've been at this it's been a long day
 
06:19:34.150 --> 06:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
for you all um i'm happy to answer any
 
06:19:36.548 --> 06:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any questions um

but i just wanted to touch on a few of
 
06:19:40.070 --> 06:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
those things from where from where i sit
 
06:19:42.150 --> 06:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
and how i see it thank you your honor
 
06:19:44.948 --> 06:19:44.958 align:start position:0%
that was very informative
 
06:19:48.310 --> 06:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
um i see representative belanger has a
 
06:19:48.320 --> 06:19:50.230 align:start position:0%
um i see representative belanger has a
question

06:19:50.230 --> 06:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:19:51.430 --> 06:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you your honor for being here
 
06:19:53.030 --> 06:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for allowing me to
 
06:19:55.350 --> 06:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
ask the question so
 
06:19:57.270 --> 06:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
06:19:58.628 --> 06:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
is this
 
06:20:00.310 --> 06:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
what we're hearing
 
06:20:02.868 --> 06:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
is this i understand
 
06:20:05.350 --> 06:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
how do we do this
 
06:20:07.190 --> 06:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
all i can tell you and i mean absolutely
 
06:20:08.788 --> 06:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
no disrespect to anyone here in the
 
06:20:11.430 --> 06:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
courtroom and i i don't don't know their
 
06:20:14.390 --> 06:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
individual cases um and and
 
06:20:15.830 --> 06:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
all i can tell you is from my own
 
06:20:17.830 --> 06:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
experience and and
 
06:20:19.430 --> 06:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh we have
 
06:20:21.590 --> 06:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have tens of thousands of these cases
 
06:20:23.670 --> 06:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
new coming in new every year i think you
 
06:20:25.910 --> 06:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
heard um administrative judge king talk
 
06:20:28.390 --> 06:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
about that or if you were here a week
 
06:20:31.190 --> 06:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
ago monday he spoke to the numbers and
 
06:20:32.948 --> 06:20:32.958 align:start position:0%
the cases that have been brought forward
 
06:20:35.270 --> 06:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
um are almost equal to that
 
06:20:39.270 --> 06:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
and and we have i think now 39 judges
 
06:20:41.990 --> 06:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
handling those thousands of cases
 
06:20:42.000 --> 06:20:44.468 align:start position:0%
handling those thousands of cases
and

06:20:44.468 --> 06:20:44.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:46.708 --> 06:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
these are difficult cases there is a lot
 
06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
of emotion
 
06:20:51.590 --> 06:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
and there are often people who
 
06:20:54.150 --> 06:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
have concerns about the process who've
 
06:20:56.310 --> 06:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
had a very difficult experience with the
 
06:21:00.868 --> 06:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:00.878 --> 06:21:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
but

06:21:01.830 --> 06:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:21:06.868 --> 06:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:08.390 --> 06:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
make orders
 
06:21:08.400 --> 06:21:09.270 align:start position:0%
make orders
that

06:21:09.270 --> 06:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:21:11.990 --> 06:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
are going to promote
 
06:21:14.070 --> 06:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
the children's best interests and we can
 
06:21:15.910 --> 06:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
only do what we can with the tools that
 
06:21:17.350 --> 06:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
we have and the evidence that's been
 
06:21:19.910 --> 06:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
presented to us and apply the law to it
 
06:21:22.948 --> 06:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
i mean that's the thing we have to apply
 
06:21:25.670 --> 06:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
all of the factors under 461 a6 which
 
06:21:28.390 --> 06:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
include evidence of of abuse and that
 
06:21:30.310 --> 06:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
would be abuse of apparent abuse of a
 
06:21:32.868 --> 06:21:32.878 align:start position:0%
child under the the child protection act
 
06:21:35.030 --> 06:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
or domestic violence statute
 
06:21:35.040 --> 06:21:37.430 align:start position:0%
or domestic violence statute
um

06:21:37.430 --> 06:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:39.830 --> 06:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
i understand they're you're hearing very
 
06:21:41.590 --> 06:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
very different stories all i can tell
 
06:21:43.750 --> 06:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
you is is how we approach it from the
 
06:21:43.760 --> 06:21:45.830 align:start position:0%
you is is how we approach it from the
bench

06:21:45.830 --> 06:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
bench
 
06:21:45.840 --> 06:21:46.548 align:start position:0%
bench
i

06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:21:46.558 --> 06:21:47.350 align:start position:0%
i
i

06:21:47.350 --> 06:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:21:49.830 --> 06:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
truly believe it's not the vast majority
 
06:21:53.910 --> 06:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:53.920 --> 06:21:54.788 align:start position:0%
 
but

06:21:54.788 --> 06:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:21:56.628 --> 06:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
i don't know how else to explain it to
 
06:21:59.670 --> 06:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
you there are people who absolutely have
 
06:22:02.150 --> 06:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
had a very difficult time with their own
 
06:22:04.070 --> 06:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
case and their case is important
 
06:22:05.990 --> 06:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
everyone's case is important every child
 
06:22:07.510 --> 06:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
is important every parent going through
 
06:22:09.270 --> 06:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
this process
 
06:22:11.750 --> 06:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
if it were an ideal world we'd have more
 
06:22:15.270 --> 06:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
judges we'd have more staff we'd have
 
06:22:18.150 --> 06:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
more time to spend on each case
 
06:22:20.310 --> 06:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
some cases that have been in existence
 
06:22:22.150 --> 06:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
for a long time
 
06:22:24.310 --> 06:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
and and maybe some of these folks here
 
06:22:27.110 --> 06:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
have cases like this they have
 
06:22:29.030 --> 06:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
pleadings and pleadings over years and
 
06:22:30.230 --> 06:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
they've been involved in the court
 
06:22:32.708 --> 06:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
system for a long time and and it's just
 
06:22:34.868 --> 06:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
it's horrible
 
06:22:36.948 --> 06:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
if we could all spend as much time as
 
06:22:38.948 --> 06:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
i'm fortunate to be able to do on this
 
06:22:41.430 --> 06:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
particular docket at this time
 
06:22:43.110 --> 06:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
06:22:45.190 --> 06:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
maybe we could help these parties more
 
06:22:47.190 --> 06:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
help these children more but we do what
 
06:22:49.830 --> 06:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
we can with the resources that we have
 
06:22:52.948 --> 06:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
and i i've also had success stories i
 
06:22:56.150 --> 06:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
have had great success stories with
 
06:22:59.110 --> 06:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
children who may have
 
06:23:01.190 --> 06:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
had for whatever reason
 
06:23:03.830 --> 06:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
a strained relationship with a parent
 
06:23:05.350 --> 06:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
then go on to have a very strong
 
06:23:07.510 --> 06:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
relationship you heard earlier
 
06:23:09.190 --> 06:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
talk of what happens in child abuse
 
06:23:11.510 --> 06:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
neglect cases and for four years sitting
 
06:23:13.190 --> 06:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
full time in dover that was almost my
 
06:23:14.948 --> 06:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
entire caseload was child abuse and
 
06:23:16.310 --> 06:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
neglect and termination of parental
 
06:23:19.110 --> 06:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
rights cases and they were so difficult
 
06:23:19.120 --> 06:23:19.910 align:start position:0%
rights cases and they were so difficult
but

06:23:19.910 --> 06:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:23:22.708 --> 06:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
we always always always worked towards
 
06:23:24.708 --> 06:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
reunifying the child or children with
 
06:23:27.110 --> 06:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
the parent or parents
 
06:23:29.510 --> 06:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
and that by law is what we have to do
 
06:23:31.910 --> 06:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's the original plan starting
 
06:23:34.310 --> 06:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
out and whatever the issue was that
 
06:23:35.350 --> 06:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
brought the
 
06:23:37.110 --> 06:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
the parties before us whatever the
 
06:23:39.030 --> 06:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
conditions were that led to a finding of
 
06:23:41.270 --> 06:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect they have 12 months to
 
06:23:43.430 --> 06:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
correct those conditions whether it's if
 
06:23:45.350 --> 06:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's substance abuse
 
06:23:47.830 --> 06:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
they get into a recovery program they
 
06:23:50.548 --> 06:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
have services that are provided and we
 
06:23:52.070 --> 06:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
encourage them we meet with them on a
 
06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
periodic basis and
 
06:23:54.400 --> 06:23:55.430 align:start position:0%
periodic basis and
and

06:23:55.430 --> 06:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:23:57.030 --> 06:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
often counseling is involved as you can
 
06:23:59.830 --> 06:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
imagine in that process and has to be
 
06:24:02.150 --> 06:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
with a child that may have been
 
06:24:03.430 --> 06:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
subjected to
 
06:24:07.110 --> 06:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
some very serious trying things
 
06:24:09.830 --> 06:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
if if we were straight out flat out
 
06:24:13.190 --> 06:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
precluded from ordering counseling or or
 
06:24:14.708 --> 06:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
what is being called reunification
 
06:24:16.390 --> 06:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
counseling here
 
06:24:18.788 --> 06:24:18.798 align:start position:0%
what would we do in cases like that
 
06:24:21.430 --> 06:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
in those cases once they close they go
 
06:24:21.440 --> 06:24:22.468 align:start position:0%
in those cases once they close they go
into

06:24:22.468 --> 06:24:22.478 align:start position:0%
into
 
06:24:25.670 --> 06:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
the regular parenting or divorce
 
06:24:27.670 --> 06:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
docket because they need to have a
 
06:24:29.830 --> 06:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
parenting plan then if if the child is
 
06:24:32.070 --> 06:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
reunified and if they don't have orders
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
presently in effect and they're in
 
06:24:34.948 --> 06:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
separate households they need court
 
06:24:37.670 --> 06:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
orders to help them going forward
 
06:24:39.110 --> 06:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
and we
 
06:24:41.030 --> 06:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
likely are going to have counseling
 
06:24:43.990 --> 06:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
continue in those cases if we can and
 
06:24:45.830 --> 06:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
the parents are probably going to want
 
06:24:48.468 --> 06:24:48.478 align:start position:0%
it the children are going to need it and
 
06:24:50.548 --> 06:24:50.558 align:start position:0%
and we can't be precluded from ordering
 
06:24:52.788 --> 06:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
it if it's truly appropriate and in the
 
06:24:54.628 --> 06:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
child's best interests
 
06:24:56.628 --> 06:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
um again
 
06:24:56.638 --> 06:24:57.430 align:start position:0%
um again
these

06:24:57.430 --> 06:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
06:24:59.750 --> 06:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
the reunification protocol i spoke about
 
06:25:03.750 --> 06:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
is expensive it is i understand that
 
06:25:05.590 --> 06:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
and so we do
 
06:25:07.990 --> 06:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
consider what parents are able to afford
 
06:25:09.270 --> 06:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
if they can't afford it it's not going
 
06:25:11.990 --> 06:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
to work if they if they don't agree to
 
06:25:15.270 --> 06:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
it at the outset it's not going to work
 
06:25:21.270 --> 06:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:23.510 --> 06:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
not wanting
 
06:25:25.750 --> 06:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
one parent to choose a counselor perhaps
 
06:25:28.548 --> 06:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
for a child or what do you do if the
 
06:25:28.558 --> 06:25:29.830 align:start position:0%
for a child or what do you do if the
parties

06:25:29.830 --> 06:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
parties
 
06:25:31.030 --> 06:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
have joint decision-making
 
06:25:32.548 --> 06:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
responsibility meaning they're supposed
 
06:25:34.948 --> 06:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
to speak to each other and reach an
 
06:25:36.468 --> 06:25:36.478 align:start position:0%
agreement before they make major
 
06:25:37.590 --> 06:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
decisions like putting a child in
 
06:25:39.590 --> 06:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
counseling what does one parent do if
 
06:25:41.030 --> 06:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
they really want their child in
 
06:25:43.030 --> 06:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
counseling and the other parent just
 
06:25:45.990 --> 06:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
won't agree won't respond even
 
06:25:47.350 --> 06:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
make a court order
 
06:25:49.270 --> 06:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
disregards the court order what do you
 
06:25:49.280 --> 06:25:50.868 align:start position:0%
disregards the court order what do you
do

06:25:50.868 --> 06:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:25:52.708 --> 06:25:52.718 align:start position:0%
in that case that parent brings that to
 
06:25:55.270 --> 06:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
the court's attention and we might make
 
06:25:58.070 --> 06:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
an order that allows that parent the the
 
06:25:59.830 --> 06:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
06:26:03.910 --> 06:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:06.150 --> 06:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
every case is very fact driven
 
06:26:08.230 --> 06:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
and we just have to pay particular
 
06:26:09.990 --> 06:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
attention to the facts in that case and
 
06:26:12.708 --> 06:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
what the child in that case needs
 
06:26:15.110 --> 06:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
and what the parents are able
 
06:26:16.310 --> 06:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
to do
 
06:26:18.230 --> 06:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
not only financially but otherwise are
 
06:26:19.670 --> 06:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
they able to communicate are they able
 
06:26:22.070 --> 06:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
to agree if not how do we do that
 
06:26:25.350 --> 06:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
i i'm not going to just pick a counselor
 
06:26:29.030 --> 06:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
for a party or a child
 
06:26:32.070 --> 06:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm going to get them to refer to
 
06:26:34.310 --> 06:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
other professionals who might know that
 
06:26:38.468 --> 06:26:38.478 align:start position:0%
child pediatrician is a great one
 
06:26:40.310 --> 06:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's someone that should be able to
 
06:26:41.750 --> 06:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
make that referral
 
06:26:41.760 --> 06:26:43.110 align:start position:0%
make that referral
um

06:26:43.110 --> 06:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:44.708 --> 06:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
i i can't
 
06:26:47.030 --> 06:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
i can't say what every judge has done
 
06:26:49.270 --> 06:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
um but i can tell you that that i and
 
06:26:49.280 --> 06:26:49.990 align:start position:0%
um but i can tell you that that i and
and

06:26:49.990 --> 06:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:26:51.830 --> 06:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
and my colleagues that i know i've been
 
06:26:54.070 --> 06:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
on the bench for a long time with
 
06:26:55.670 --> 06:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
working in these cases caring about
 
06:26:57.190 --> 06:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
these cases about the parties that
 
06:26:59.830 --> 06:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
appear before us and the children
 
06:27:02.468 --> 06:27:02.478 align:start position:0%
we're just striving to do what's in the
 
06:27:04.468 --> 06:27:04.478 align:start position:0%
child's best interest
 
06:27:06.310 --> 06:27:06.320 align:start position:0%

going to discuss this bill but at this
 
06:28:05.600 --> 06:28:06.468 align:start position:0%
going to discuss this bill but at this
point

06:28:06.468 --> 06:28:06.478 align:start position:0%
point
 
06:28:08.070 --> 06:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
just to give you a quick little heads up
 
06:28:10.230 --> 06:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
here on based on my case which you've
 
06:28:11.910 --> 06:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
all heard my case all day long today
 
06:28:14.390 --> 06:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
being the silva v silva
 
06:28:14.400 --> 06:28:15.190 align:start position:0%
being the silva v silva
my

06:28:15.190 --> 06:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:28:16.788 --> 06:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
income has been compromised through
 
06:28:19.350 --> 06:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
child support as you all know
 
06:28:22.230 --> 06:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
so right now our lifestyles are not
 
06:28:24.948 --> 06:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
equal and by a parent
 
06:28:26.708 --> 06:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
who keeps spending more money on the
 
06:28:28.390 --> 06:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
children and buying them the things that
 
06:28:29.510 --> 06:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
they want
 
06:28:31.670 --> 06:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
is very damaging on a relationship like
 
06:28:33.830 --> 06:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
mine with my daughter
 
06:28:36.548 --> 06:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
my children right now my relationship
 
06:28:38.548 --> 06:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
has been so damaged that i don't think
 
06:28:42.548 --> 06:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
i'll ever be the same so i think by
 
06:28:43.910 --> 06:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:28:46.708 --> 06:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
i obviously think that some of it has to
 
06:28:49.350 --> 06:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
be modified to a certain degree to make
 
06:28:52.070 --> 06:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
sure that it is covered by insurance but
 
06:28:54.628 --> 06:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
for what has happened in my life and
 
06:28:57.270 --> 06:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
trying to alienate me from my children
 
06:28:59.270 --> 06:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
it is not that in the best interest of
 
06:29:00.708 --> 06:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
my children
 
06:29:03.030 --> 06:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
and this actually has abused not only
 
06:29:05.110 --> 06:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
the system through harassment of all of
 
06:29:07.030 --> 06:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
these years the seven years that i've
 
06:29:09.350 --> 06:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
been in the system but it's also mental
 
06:29:12.468 --> 06:29:12.478 align:start position:0%
abuse on my children so at this point in
 
06:29:16.230 --> 06:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
into your um to your point exactly is
 
06:29:18.868 --> 06:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
now i have to go back through um the
 
06:29:20.948 --> 06:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
court to ask for therapy
 
06:29:23.590 --> 06:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
for my children so now i'm in the same
 
06:29:25.910 --> 06:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
situation as you guys are here right now
 
06:29:27.430 --> 06:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions you're very
 
06:29:30.868 --> 06:29:30.878 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions
 
06:29:34.468 --> 06:29:34.478 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you and thank you for
 
06:29:36.390 --> 06:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
speeding it up i appreciate it i know
 
06:29:38.150 --> 06:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's important
 
06:29:40.390 --> 06:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
no what you have to say is important and
 
06:29:42.708 --> 06:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
we want to hear it
 
06:29:42.718 --> 06:29:43.910 align:start position:0%
we want to hear it
and

06:29:43.910 --> 06:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:29:46.708 --> 06:29:46.718 align:start position:0%
with that i have no more pink cards
 
06:29:46.718 --> 06:29:47.910 align:start position:0%
with that i have no more pink cards
um

06:29:47.910 --> 06:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:51.430 --> 06:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
on 11.99 i will close the hearing on
 
06:29:51.440 --> 06:29:55.590 align:start position:0%
on 11.99 i will close the hearing on
11.99

06:29:55.590 --> 06:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:58.868 --> 06:29:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:58.878 --> 06:30:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:30:00.070 --> 06:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:30:01.030 --> 06:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
i will
 
06:30:03.750 --> 06:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
open the hearing um
 
06:30:08.868 --> 06:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:11.270 --> 06:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure that representative gay is
 
06:30:13.510 --> 06:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
going to send a pink card up
 
06:30:22.070 --> 06:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:26.868 --> 06:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:30.548 --> 06:30:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:33.110 --> 06:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment is short and the actual
 
06:30:36.070 --> 06:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
even though the uh bill looks long it
 
06:30:37.190 --> 06:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
only has
 
06:30:39.510 --> 06:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
three things in it they just put the
 
06:30:43.750 --> 06:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
entire build entire rsa there or several
 
06:30:46.628 --> 06:30:46.638 align:start position:0%
and then so there's just uh
 
06:30:48.070 --> 06:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
let's see there's four little things
 
06:30:48.080 --> 06:30:48.868 align:start position:0%
let's see there's four little things
here

06:30:48.868 --> 06:30:48.878 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:30:51.110 --> 06:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
so if you want to look at your bill
 
06:30:53.270 --> 06:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
go to page two
 
06:30:54.548 --> 06:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
this is about
 
06:30:56.310 --> 06:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh if you're
 
06:30:57.750 --> 06:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
well there are multiple multiple things
 
06:31:00.868 --> 06:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
about dealing with your gal
 
06:31:03.750 --> 06:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
so number one one some of the issues
 
06:31:05.910 --> 06:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
that i've been told about by people who
 
06:31:08.948 --> 06:31:08.958 align:start position:0%
are very unhappy were that
 
06:31:11.750 --> 06:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
they had the gal who wasn't treating
 
06:31:13.830 --> 06:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
both parents equally and their real
 
06:31:16.230 --> 06:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
concern is supposed to be the children
 
06:31:17.910 --> 06:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
so they shouldn't be
 
06:31:20.230 --> 06:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
favoring a parent over the other parent
 
06:31:22.310 --> 06:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
they should be gathering in
 
06:31:25.270 --> 06:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
information about alls
 
06:31:27.510 --> 06:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
another problem with guardian ad litems
 
06:31:29.670 --> 06:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
right now is that they can bill
 
06:31:29.680 --> 06:31:30.628 align:start position:0%
right now is that they can bill
without

06:31:30.628 --> 06:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
without
 
06:31:32.468 --> 06:31:32.478 align:start position:0%
specifying what they're billing for or
 
06:31:35.270 --> 06:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
how many hours it was or
 
06:31:37.190 --> 06:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh when you just
 
06:31:39.190 --> 06:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you get a bill and
 
06:31:40.868 --> 06:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
you've got to pay it or else you're
 
06:31:41.910 --> 06:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
06:31:43.030 --> 06:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
in trouble
 
06:31:45.910 --> 06:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh and then it also as this bill also
 
06:31:47.830 --> 06:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
addresses the issue that when you have a
 
06:31:50.150 --> 06:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
gl that you think is doing things that
 
06:31:52.548 --> 06:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
are underhanded you really don't have
 
06:31:55.030 --> 06:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
anybody but the gal board to report them
 
06:31:57.350 --> 06:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
to and statistically
 
06:31:59.910 --> 06:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
their response is really
 
06:31:59.920 --> 06:32:00.830 align:start position:0%
their response is really
about

06:32:00.830 --> 06:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:32:03.990 --> 06:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
zero so on page two
 
06:32:05.750 --> 06:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh line thirteen
 
06:32:07.590 --> 06:32:07.600 align:start position:0%

06:38:43.350 --> 06:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
court proceeding and the other one
 
06:38:44.948 --> 06:38:44.958 align:start position:0%
was until
 
06:38:46.070 --> 06:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
06:38:49.030 --> 06:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
six months after the final hearing
 
06:38:51.190 --> 06:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
at this time i discovered she had spent
 
06:38:52.948 --> 06:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
you know significant more time speaking
 
06:38:54.788 --> 06:38:54.798 align:start position:0%
with stella via zoom
 
06:38:57.510 --> 06:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
um when my daughter was with her father
 
06:39:00.070 --> 06:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
kathleen also spoke again about my to my
 
06:39:02.788 --> 06:39:02.798 align:start position:0%
ex and his wife that i was unaware of
 
06:39:04.868 --> 06:39:04.878 align:start position:0%

from him after the the status hearing
 
06:39:09.590 --> 06:39:09.600 align:start position:0%

06:39:14.390 --> 06:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
let's see i'm trying to glimpse it over
 
06:39:16.270 --> 06:39:16.280 align:start position:0%

06:39:30.628 --> 06:39:30.638 align:start position:0%
after the status hearing um kathleen
 
06:39:32.628 --> 06:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
asked for weekly updates with my ex
 
06:39:34.390 --> 06:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
which consisted of more construed
 
06:39:36.948 --> 06:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
allegations about me and my scheduled
 
06:39:38.948 --> 06:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
time with our daughter and no point
 
06:39:41.110 --> 06:39:41.120 align:start position:0%

allegations

i was asked for an update on january
 
06:39:47.120 --> 06:39:48.468 align:start position:0%
i was asked for an update on january
13th

06:39:48.468 --> 06:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
13th
 
06:39:50.468 --> 06:39:50.478 align:start position:0%
before our final hearing
 
06:39:53.270 --> 06:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
i stated my concerns and
 
06:39:55.590 --> 06:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
answered kathleen's questions kathleen
 
06:39:58.390 --> 06:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
immediately emailed my ex to ask him to
 
06:39:58.400 --> 06:39:59.350 align:start position:0%
immediately emailed my ex to ask him to
explain

06:39:59.350 --> 06:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
explain
 
06:40:01.990 --> 06:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
the concerns i had but she had not
 
06:40:03.670 --> 06:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
done the same for me
 
06:40:06.548 --> 06:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
i wasn't given the same opportunity
 
06:40:09.750 --> 06:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is concerning um the
 
06:40:11.750 --> 06:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
procedures for guardians that light him
 
06:40:14.070 --> 06:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
in the family corporate seatings
 
06:40:16.708 --> 06:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
could specifically the billing
 
06:40:19.030 --> 06:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay can we stay with that please sure
 
06:40:21.750 --> 06:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
you have one more minute okay
 
06:40:21.760 --> 06:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
you have one more minute okay
um

06:40:23.990 --> 06:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:25.830 --> 06:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
i guess i wish i would have been aware
 
06:40:27.590 --> 06:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
of um
 
06:40:30.948 --> 06:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
on the bill you get an itemized yeah not
 
06:40:33.190 --> 06:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
only how much is she charging but how
 
06:40:33.200 --> 06:40:34.150 align:start position:0%
only how much is she charging but how
she's

06:40:34.150 --> 06:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
she's
 
06:40:36.150 --> 06:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
spending her time
 
06:40:39.590 --> 06:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
you don't discover these things until
 
06:40:42.948 --> 06:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
maybe 24 hours before court i got her
 
06:40:42.958 --> 06:40:44.150 align:start position:0%
maybe 24 hours before court i got her
file

06:40:44.150 --> 06:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
file
 
06:40:46.230 --> 06:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
um but like i said her final bill i
 
06:40:48.708 --> 06:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
didn't get until six six months after my
 
06:40:52.230 --> 06:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
final hearing which if i wanted to
 
06:40:52.240 --> 06:40:56.868 align:start position:0%
final hearing which if i wanted to
um

06:40:56.868 --> 06:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:58.868 --> 06:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
proceed forth i don't know whatever way
 
06:41:01.430 --> 06:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
i would have wanted to i i feel like
 
06:41:04.548 --> 06:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
it's been so much time why reopen it
 
06:41:06.070 --> 06:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
um so i guess
 
06:41:08.070 --> 06:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
billing is definitely important to know
 
06:41:11.350 --> 06:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
and keep maybe an updated um
 
06:41:13.270 --> 06:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
on both parents not keeping it from the
 
06:41:13.280 --> 06:41:14.708 align:start position:0%
on both parents not keeping it from the
other

06:41:14.708 --> 06:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:41:17.990 --> 06:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you no thank you
 
06:41:21.270 --> 06:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:22.948 --> 06:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
06:41:25.110 --> 06:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time next i'll call
 
06:41:29.590 --> 06:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:29.600 --> 06:41:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
honorable

06:41:31.030 --> 06:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
honorable
 
06:41:32.868 --> 06:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
dan you're asking for five minutes in
 
06:41:35.430 --> 06:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
the interest of time can we squish it to
 
06:41:37.990 --> 06:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
maybe two and a half i'll do my absolute
 
06:41:39.990 --> 06:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
best thank you uh
 
06:41:42.390 --> 06:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm dan it's i still
 
06:41:46.150 --> 06:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
reside in manchester uh 12 years ago i
 
06:41:48.788 --> 06:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
was vice chair of the committee to
 
06:41:51.590 --> 06:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
review the gal audit
 
06:41:54.390 --> 06:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
and the legislation that you see here
 
06:41:56.670 --> 06:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
was one of the products of that in
 
06:41:59.590 --> 06:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
2013-14 i forget particularly
 
06:41:59.600 --> 06:42:01.270 align:start position:0%
2013-14 i forget particularly
um

06:42:01.270 --> 06:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:04.948 --> 06:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
one thing that i would add to
 
06:42:08.150 --> 06:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
the legend to the law as it stands now
 
06:42:10.708 --> 06:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
page one line twenty three
 
06:42:14.230 --> 06:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
the guardian item has to report their uh
 
06:42:14.240 --> 06:42:15.670 align:start position:0%
the guardian item has to report their uh
investigation

06:42:15.670 --> 06:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
06:42:18.628 --> 06:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
at at the pre-trial hearing i think it
 
06:42:20.628 --> 06:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial to the parties if
 
06:42:22.390 --> 06:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
there were some additional period like
 
06:42:24.070 --> 06:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
five days before
 
06:42:26.390 --> 06:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
the pre the pre-trial hearing so they
 
06:42:28.628 --> 06:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
know what they're expecting
 
06:42:28.638 --> 06:42:30.628 align:start position:0%
know what they're expecting
um

06:42:30.628 --> 06:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:33.750 --> 06:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
as to uh billing the
 
06:42:33.760 --> 06:42:35.190 align:start position:0%
as to uh billing the
the

06:42:35.190 --> 06:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:42:37.670 --> 06:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
rate is essentially set by the state
 
06:42:40.628 --> 06:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
because it's all keyed to the rate set
 
06:42:42.948 --> 06:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
for abuse in the neglect cases so that's
 
06:42:44.868 --> 06:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
the benchmark
 
06:42:48.230 --> 06:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
and then for those privately paying
 
06:42:50.948 --> 06:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
there are no state payees right now uh
 
06:42:52.708 --> 06:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
because there's no fund for private
 
06:42:55.030 --> 06:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
payees the rate can be no more than
 
06:42:57.670 --> 06:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
twice that
 
06:43:01.350 --> 06:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
and it can't exceed more than 23 hours
 
06:43:03.030 --> 06:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
unless they agree i think it would be
 
06:43:05.750 --> 06:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
very beneficial to insert after they
 
06:43:09.350 --> 06:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
agree that the gal or the parties or the
 
06:43:13.350 --> 06:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
court has to say 23 hours plus 20 hours
 
06:43:16.150 --> 06:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
plus 40 hours so that everybody knows
 
06:43:17.910 --> 06:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
what they're getting into no blank
 
06:43:17.920 --> 06:43:19.110 align:start position:0%
what they're getting into no blank
checks

06:43:19.110 --> 06:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
checks
 
06:43:21.350 --> 06:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's a real problem
 
06:43:21.360 --> 06:43:23.350 align:start position:0%
that's a real problem
um

06:43:23.350 --> 06:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:26.070 --> 06:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
i would go on
 
06:43:28.868 --> 06:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
under uh now it is it was the intent of
 
06:43:30.070 --> 06:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
06:43:33.750 --> 06:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
that once the gal's contract appointment
 
06:43:36.230 --> 06:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
expired there was no more work done
 
06:43:38.310 --> 06:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
there was no more billing that was all
 
06:43:40.468 --> 06:43:40.478 align:start position:0%
the parents were obligated to
 
06:43:43.270 --> 06:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
and that is from what i hear not the
 
06:43:43.280 --> 06:43:44.230 align:start position:0%
and that is from what i hear not the
case

06:43:44.230 --> 06:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
case
 
06:43:46.708 --> 06:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
that the that the guardian items
 
06:43:48.150 --> 06:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
activities continue after the
 
06:43:49.990 --> 06:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
appointment in some cases
 
06:43:52.548 --> 06:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
and uh be and
 
06:43:54.708 --> 06:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
that some judges require those
 
06:43:56.468 --> 06:43:56.478 align:start position:0%
additional fees to be paid
 
06:43:58.150 --> 06:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
i think you should strengthen section
 
06:44:00.788 --> 06:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
five roman numeral five
 
06:44:03.190 --> 06:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
and make it clear that the parties are
 
06:44:05.910 --> 06:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
not responsible once the appointment
 
06:44:05.920 --> 06:44:08.948 align:start position:0%
not responsible once the appointment
expires

06:44:08.948 --> 06:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:10.868 --> 06:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
if the gao wants to work then it's on
 
06:44:13.350 --> 06:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
them it's donated work
 
06:44:13.360 --> 06:44:15.110 align:start position:0%
them it's donated work
um

06:44:15.110 --> 06:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:15.120 --> 06:44:16.070 align:start position:0%
um
and

06:44:16.070 --> 06:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:44:17.430 --> 06:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's it i'd be happy to take any
 
06:44:17.440 --> 06:44:18.708 align:start position:0%
that's it i'd be happy to take any
questions

06:44:18.708 --> 06:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:44:19.750 --> 06:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:44:23.270 --> 06:44:23.280 align:start position:0%

thank you so much for your time i
 
06:44:27.030 --> 06:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate you
 
06:44:28.628 --> 06:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
squishing it down
 
06:44:31.030 --> 06:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
the next person will be
 
06:44:38.468 --> 06:44:38.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:40.150 --> 06:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair again for the

06:44:47.350 --> 06:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
is a very brief preliminary matter i
 
06:44:49.670 --> 06:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that the copy of
 
06:44:51.270 --> 06:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
this page 2
 
06:44:53.670 --> 06:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
lines 13 to 15
 
06:44:53.680 --> 06:44:55.030 align:start position:0%
lines 13 to 15
speaking

06:44:55.030 --> 06:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
06:44:55.040 --> 06:44:55.990 align:start position:0%
speaking
to

06:44:55.990 --> 06:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:44:56.000 --> 06:44:56.708 align:start position:0%
to
uh

06:44:56.708 --> 06:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:44:58.788 --> 06:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
equal amounts of time
 
06:45:00.230 --> 06:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
that something
 
06:45:03.110 --> 06:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
like that is still in whatever
 
06:45:05.190 --> 06:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
or similar to it whatever version we're
 
06:45:06.708 --> 06:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
discussing now because i don't have the
 
06:45:08.390 --> 06:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
most recent
 
06:45:12.310 --> 06:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh and also the same for billing down in
 
06:45:16.390 --> 06:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
28 30 so i do speak to the bill
 
06:45:19.190 --> 06:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh just as a one more very brief
 
06:45:22.150 --> 06:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
preliminary matter i just want to echo
 
06:45:25.990 --> 06:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh rep belanger's comment about
 
06:45:27.830 --> 06:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
he's hearing
 
06:45:27.840 --> 06:45:28.868 align:start position:0%
he's hearing
this

06:45:28.868 --> 06:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:45:28.878 --> 06:45:30.310 align:start position:0%
this
from

06:45:30.310 --> 06:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:45:32.788 --> 06:45:32.798 align:start position:0%
the judge all wonderful things and this
 
06:45:35.270 --> 06:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
from the parties and how do we get from
 
06:45:35.280 --> 06:45:36.310 align:start position:0%
from the parties and how do we get from
here

06:45:36.310 --> 06:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:45:37.510 --> 06:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
to here
 
06:45:40.230 --> 06:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
so you might get just a couple sentences
 
06:45:42.788 --> 06:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
that mixed in to address these two
 
06:45:45.830 --> 06:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:47.670 --> 06:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm just gonna
 
06:45:50.070 --> 06:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
um kathleen sternenberg
 
06:45:51.910 --> 06:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
in my case
 
06:45:51.920 --> 06:45:52.868 align:start position:0%
in my case
uh

06:45:52.868 --> 06:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:45:54.548 --> 06:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
i'm one of the nine
 
06:45:57.910 --> 06:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh essentially heavy heavily favored uh
 
06:46:01.350 --> 06:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
my ex in terms of how much time she sent
 
06:46:03.510 --> 06:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
i would go so far as to say she acted
 
06:46:06.150 --> 06:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
almost as her second counsel
 
06:46:09.190 --> 06:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe the written transcript of
 
06:46:12.548 --> 06:46:12.558 align:start position:0%
her testimony uh the gal testimony uh
 
06:46:15.910 --> 06:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
presented last tuesday to this committee
 
06:46:17.990 --> 06:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
would support that so again i think
 
06:46:20.708 --> 06:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
that's speaking to equal amounts of time
 
06:46:20.718 --> 06:46:22.230 align:start position:0%
that's speaking to equal amounts of time
and

06:46:22.230 --> 06:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:46:22.240 --> 06:46:24.150 align:start position:0%
and
non-bias

06:46:24.150 --> 06:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
non-bias
 
06:46:24.160 --> 06:46:26.468 align:start position:0%
non-bias
um

06:46:26.468 --> 06:46:26.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:29.270 --> 06:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of billing
 
06:46:32.628 --> 06:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
she charged over ten thousand dollars in
 
06:46:35.750 --> 06:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
fees for her investigation
 
06:46:35.760 --> 06:46:36.548 align:start position:0%
fees for her investigation
uh

06:46:36.548 --> 06:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:46:39.190 --> 06:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
to relocation to california
 
06:46:42.070 --> 06:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
when the maximum written fee cap i ever
 
06:46:44.948 --> 06:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
got was four thousand dollars
 
06:46:47.270 --> 06:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
um at the time
 
06:46:47.280 --> 06:46:48.548 align:start position:0%
um at the time
i

06:46:48.548 --> 06:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:46:51.990 --> 06:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
didn't know any better but i think the
 
06:46:54.628 --> 06:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
you know billing in here is speaking to
 
06:46:54.638 --> 06:46:56.830 align:start position:0%
you know billing in here is speaking to
that

06:46:56.830 --> 06:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:46:59.670 --> 06:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
um in terms of equal
 
06:47:02.310 --> 06:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
amounts of time i just might suggest to
 
06:47:05.590 --> 06:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
say something about references as well
 
06:47:08.468 --> 06:47:08.478 align:start position:0%
because i found that she
 
06:47:10.788 --> 06:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
spent a whole lot more time speaking to
 
06:47:14.070 --> 06:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
mom's references than mine
 
06:47:14.080 --> 06:47:16.708 align:start position:0%
mom's references than mine
um

06:47:16.708 --> 06:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:16.718 --> 06:47:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:47:17.750 --> 06:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:47:19.510 --> 06:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
just to kind of wrap this all up and
 
06:47:22.548 --> 06:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
close in terms of what happened here
 
06:47:24.310 --> 06:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
with meeting the time
 
06:47:27.030 --> 06:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
in the billing if
 
06:47:29.430 --> 06:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
by law we're supposed to promote a
 
06:47:32.468 --> 06:47:32.478 align:start position:0%
healthy relationship with both parents
 
06:47:35.030 --> 06:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
i would just have to ask
 
06:47:36.628 --> 06:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
in my case
 
06:47:39.190 --> 06:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
how a gal
 
06:47:41.590 --> 06:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
moving the kids all around the country
 
06:47:44.070 --> 06:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
does that in charging
 
06:47:46.310 --> 06:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars for it
 
06:47:48.548 --> 06:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
you know what's going on here and that's
 
06:47:51.430 --> 06:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
just to kind of close with the gulf once
 
06:47:53.030 --> 06:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
again between
 
06:47:54.390 --> 06:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
rep belanger
 
06:47:54.400 --> 06:47:55.510 align:start position:0%
rep belanger
and

06:47:55.510 --> 06:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:47:57.990 --> 06:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
her honor how do we get from here to
 
06:47:58.000 --> 06:47:59.990 align:start position:0%
her honor how do we get from here to
here

06:47:59.990 --> 06:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:48:01.990 --> 06:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
and happy to take any questions
 
06:48:03.190 --> 06:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:48:06.948 --> 06:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:11.350 --> 06:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:14.868 --> 06:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
next we have eric brand
 
06:48:17.830 --> 06:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
you're asking for five minutes can we
 
06:48:20.230 --> 06:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
squish it down to two and a half please
 
06:48:23.270 --> 06:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
06:48:24.548 --> 06:48:24.558 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and committee
 
06:48:24.558 --> 06:48:25.510 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and committee
members

06:48:25.510 --> 06:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
members
 
06:48:28.230 --> 06:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
um you've heard many bills between today
 
06:48:30.150 --> 06:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
and last week as well
 
06:48:30.160 --> 06:48:32.548 align:start position:0%
and last week as well
um

06:48:32.548 --> 06:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:32.558 --> 06:48:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
i

06:48:33.350 --> 06:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:48:37.510 --> 06:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
i'm in support of 1515 and possibly
 
06:48:39.670 --> 06:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative belanger's bill as well
 
06:48:42.150 --> 06:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
but with a modification that i didn't
 
06:48:43.910 --> 06:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
see in either one of these though i
 
06:48:46.868 --> 06:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
haven't read your complete bill yet
 
06:48:49.430 --> 06:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
we all know from some of the happenings
 
06:48:52.390 --> 06:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
in the nashua court system
 
06:48:54.150 --> 06:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
that there can be a conflict of interest
 
06:48:55.430 --> 06:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
that can arise
 
06:48:57.270 --> 06:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
06:48:58.788 --> 06:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
like to believe all judges in the
 
06:49:00.948 --> 06:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
systems are very good judges
 
06:49:02.468 --> 06:49:02.478 align:start position:0%
but we've seen that there are some that
 
06:49:03.670 --> 06:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
are not
 
06:49:05.910 --> 06:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
if we were to add in
 
06:49:07.750 --> 06:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
a lottery system
 
06:49:10.708 --> 06:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
into the appointments of guardian items
 
06:49:12.548 --> 06:49:12.558 align:start position:0%
this may help many families feel
 
06:49:15.270 --> 06:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
comfortable and not feel that somebody's
 
06:49:17.430 --> 06:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
just hiring a friend such as what's
 
06:49:19.590 --> 06:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
happened in nashua now what i mean by a
 
06:49:22.070 --> 06:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
lottery system if we all think back to
 
06:49:23.670 --> 06:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
when we had the housing
 
06:49:27.270 --> 06:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh real estate crash back in 0.708
 
06:49:28.548 --> 06:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of appraisals that were
 
06:49:31.830 --> 06:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
going on it was a lot of
 
06:49:33.830 --> 06:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
bankers loan officers that were leaning
 
06:49:35.590 --> 06:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
over to their friends and saying hey i
 
06:49:36.788 --> 06:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
need an appraisal that's going to match
 
06:49:38.230 --> 06:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
what this house is selling for can you
 
06:49:39.910 --> 06:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
get it for me and if that friend
 
06:49:42.070 --> 06:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do it they'd go to another one
 
06:49:43.510 --> 06:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
so then the states moved into this
 
06:49:45.590 --> 06:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
lottery system where the appraisals were
 
06:49:47.030 --> 06:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
then appointed
 
06:49:48.468 --> 06:49:48.478 align:start position:0%
and that took away
 
06:49:50.948 --> 06:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
that whole flaw within that system
 
06:49:53.030 --> 06:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
if we were to add in something within
 
06:49:54.310 --> 06:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
these bills or maybe there's an
 
06:49:56.708 --> 06:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
additional bill that's added in
 
06:49:58.468 --> 06:49:58.478 align:start position:0%
that could hopefully change this and
 
06:49:59.910 --> 06:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
regain some confidence from some
 
06:50:01.670 --> 06:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
families that don't have confidence with
 
06:50:03.030 --> 06:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
how the guardian middle items are
 
06:50:03.040 --> 06:50:04.468 align:start position:0%
how the guardian middle items are
appointed

06:50:04.468 --> 06:50:04.478 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
06:50:07.030 --> 06:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
this all ties back into what we spoke
 
06:50:09.030 --> 06:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
about last week with the 50 50 shared
 
06:50:09.040 --> 06:50:10.150 align:start position:0%
about last week with the 50 50 shared
parenting

06:50:10.150 --> 06:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
06:50:11.910 --> 06:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
if we start with the 50 50 shared
 
06:50:14.150 --> 06:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
parenting there's going to be a lot less
 
06:50:15.590 --> 06:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
guardian items that are going to be
 
06:50:17.670 --> 06:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
needed and appointed
 
06:50:20.230 --> 06:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
because as i've testified once before
 
06:50:22.708 --> 06:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
and this is one sentence here that i
 
06:50:24.948 --> 06:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
still believe that each parent
 
06:50:27.350 --> 06:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
brings to each child being raised a
 
06:50:29.270 --> 06:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of
 
06:50:31.750 --> 06:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
characteristics and helps form that
 
06:50:33.590 --> 06:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
child and when you take one parent away

06:51:42.868 --> 06:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
sternenberg
 
06:51:45.030 --> 06:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
in many many cases
 
06:51:49.430 --> 06:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:52.070 --> 06:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
here's his complaint to the guardian ad
 
06:51:53.990 --> 06:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
litem board

i just received on december 27th
 
06:51:59.030 --> 06:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
they there was no finding
 
06:52:00.948 --> 06:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
of um
 
06:52:05.430 --> 06:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
violations on her they said under 50302
 
06:52:06.948 --> 06:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
they found no
 
06:52:10.070 --> 06:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
violations under 50302c
 
06:52:12.070 --> 06:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
says she is to
 
06:52:14.150 --> 06:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
follow her order on appointment
 
06:52:16.628 --> 06:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
from the court she did not do that she
 
06:52:18.868 --> 06:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
did not go to dad's house
 
06:52:22.628 --> 06:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
she did not meet with dad and the child
 
06:52:24.230 --> 06:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
how is it possible they have found no
 
06:52:26.390 --> 06:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
wrong doing
 
06:52:28.390 --> 06:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
and where do you go from here
 
06:52:28.400 --> 06:52:29.510 align:start position:0%
and where do you go from here
like

06:52:29.510 --> 06:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:52:31.830 --> 06:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
there's got to be
 
06:52:35.030 --> 06:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere for these parents to go
 
06:52:38.070 --> 06:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's been to the jcc it's been to the
 
06:52:40.868 --> 06:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
attorney discipline office
 
06:52:43.590 --> 06:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
this child is in
 
06:52:45.990 --> 06:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
turmoil he's got 125 behavioral
 
06:52:46.000 --> 06:52:47.990 align:start position:0%
turmoil he's got 125 behavioral
referrals

06:52:47.990 --> 06:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
referrals
 
06:52:50.150 --> 06:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
the courts will not address his mental
 
06:52:51.990 --> 06:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
emotional state
 
06:52:52.000 --> 06:52:52.948 align:start position:0%
emotional state
and

06:52:52.948 --> 06:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:52:55.350 --> 06:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
kathleen failed this child
 
06:52:57.910 --> 06:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
she concealed important information she
 
06:52:59.990 --> 06:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
concealed 87 behavioral referrals in
 
06:53:01.590 --> 06:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
fourth grade alone
 
06:53:03.590 --> 06:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
from the court she concealed
 
06:53:05.270 --> 06:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
inappropriate behaviors in the mother's
 
06:53:08.070 --> 06:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
care from the court
 
06:53:09.430 --> 06:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
06:53:11.670 --> 06:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
where for these parents to go to protect
 
06:53:14.868 --> 06:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:17.990 --> 06:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
so i just this is important that
 
06:53:20.150 --> 06:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
there's another board where you can go
 
06:53:20.160 --> 06:53:21.030 align:start position:0%
there's another board where you can go
to

06:53:21.030 --> 06:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:53:23.030 --> 06:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
to report these people
 
06:53:26.230 --> 06:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
to protect children in this state and
 
06:53:27.830 --> 06:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
we've all seen
 
06:53:30.468 --> 06:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
the news where national news now for
 
06:53:32.468 --> 06:53:32.478 align:start position:0%
abusing children this is going to stop
 
06:53:34.868 --> 06:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
these children need to be protected in
 
06:53:36.230 --> 06:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
this state
 
06:53:36.240 --> 06:53:37.590 align:start position:0%
this state
um

06:53:37.590 --> 06:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:39.830 --> 06:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you i mean that's
 
06:53:41.350 --> 06:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to be important to all of
 
06:53:42.948 --> 06:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
us and
 
06:53:48.788 --> 06:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:51.350 --> 06:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:53:53.190 --> 06:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
no questions seeing none thank you for
 
06:53:55.910 --> 06:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
06:54:06.390 --> 06:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:08.390 --> 06:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee i
 
06:54:10.150 --> 06:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
am still anna goulet zimmerman i
 
06:54:11.750 --> 06:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
practice law in manchester new hampshire
 
06:54:13.030 --> 06:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i am a member of the new hampshire
 
06:54:15.030 --> 06:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
association for justice
 
06:54:17.510 --> 06:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
i signed in a pose but that may be the
 
06:54:19.990 --> 06:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
wrong word i more just have just several
 
06:54:22.708 --> 06:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
concerns about the wording on this and i
 
06:54:24.150 --> 06:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't even planning on testifying about
 
06:54:25.430 --> 06:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
this one but since i've been here all
 
06:54:27.750 --> 06:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon i figured i'd stay for it
 
06:54:27.760 --> 06:54:28.548 align:start position:0%
afternoon i figured i'd stay for it
um

06:54:28.548 --> 06:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:30.150 --> 06:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
first part is this additional
 
06:54:33.350 --> 06:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
requirement of equal amounts of time i
 
06:54:35.190 --> 06:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
understand the sentiment where that's
 
06:54:37.430 --> 06:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
coming behind
 
06:54:39.750 --> 06:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
but there are lots of reasons why time
 
06:54:41.830 --> 06:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
might not be equal
 
06:54:43.350 --> 06:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
that is not necessarily because
 
06:54:45.110 --> 06:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
someone's biased
 
06:54:46.390 --> 06:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to give you an example of me
 
06:54:48.230 --> 06:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
and my husband who are fortunately not
 
06:54:49.990 --> 06:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
before guardian ad litem and not getting
 
06:54:52.310 --> 06:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
divorced but if you ask either of us to
 
06:54:54.468 --> 06:54:54.478 align:start position:0%
tell a story it takes me about five
 
06:54:57.110 --> 06:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
times as long as it takes him i say he's
 
06:54:59.110 --> 06:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
missing a lot of context he thinks i'm
 
06:55:00.150 --> 06:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
adding a lot of stuff that really
 
06:55:02.070 --> 06:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter but that's just how
 
06:55:03.910 --> 06:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
people are so some people are going to
 
06:55:05.110 --> 06:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
have the exact same they're going to
 
06:55:07.110 --> 06:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
have a harder time formulating their
 
06:55:08.708 --> 06:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
thoughts maybe they're rambling more
 
06:55:10.230 --> 06:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
maybe they're a little less organized
 
06:55:13.190 --> 06:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
where someone else is like here it is
 
06:55:15.590 --> 06:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean there's there's bias you
 
06:55:17.910 --> 06:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
can of course on cross-examination if
 
06:55:19.670 --> 06:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
you think these issues have come up you
 
06:55:22.548 --> 06:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
can say well look you went to this house
 
06:55:23.830 --> 06:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
you spent this much time with the kids
 
06:55:25.110 --> 06:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
there how come you didn't come to this
 
06:55:27.270 --> 06:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
house so there is a way to address those
 
06:55:29.190 --> 06:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
issues um
 
06:55:31.270 --> 06:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
as far as evidence the guardian i mean
 
06:55:33.430 --> 06:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
it feels a little like today we're we're
 
06:55:35.270 --> 06:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
more talking about is there a problem
 
06:55:37.190 --> 06:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
with a guardian ad litem which of course
 
06:55:39.110 --> 06:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
is not what this statute and the leg you
 
06:55:41.430 --> 06:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
know is is to address
 
06:55:43.910 --> 06:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
i have no issue with itemized bills i
 
06:55:46.390 --> 06:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
think that's fine um
 
06:55:48.310 --> 06:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
which shall be paid upon the conclusion
 
06:55:50.390 --> 06:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
of the guardian ad litem services i do
 
06:55:52.150 --> 06:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
have an issue with never been a guardian
 
06:55:53.750 --> 06:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
ad litem but you've heard today people
 
06:55:55.110 --> 06:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
talk to you about cases that are going
 
06:55:57.750 --> 06:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
on for seven years and if guardians
 
06:55:59.430 --> 06:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be paid until the very
 
06:56:01.670 --> 06:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
end of their cases it's hard enough to
 
06:56:03.590 --> 06:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
get guardian ad litems they ought to be
 
06:56:04.948 --> 06:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
paid as they're going along for the work
 
06:56:06.070 --> 06:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
06:56:08.628 --> 06:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
there is under section five already a
 
06:56:10.948 --> 06:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
provision for the maximum fee and you
 
06:56:12.390 --> 06:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
have to go to the court they have to ask
 
06:56:14.070 --> 06:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
for additional sufficient say they need
 
06:56:15.510 --> 06:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
the additional fees
 
06:56:18.150 --> 06:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
and and have that approved so i'm just
 
06:56:20.390 --> 06:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
i'm confused as to why
 
06:56:22.310 --> 06:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
there needs to be kind of duplication of
 
06:56:24.708 --> 06:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
that or why that's an ongoing issue
 
06:56:28.150 --> 06:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
um the last thing is the section seven
 
06:56:30.868 --> 06:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
there's already a right to report
 
06:56:33.110 --> 06:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
illegal behavior i i don't know what
 
06:56:35.510 --> 06:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to add here except maybe
 
06:56:37.750 --> 06:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
get even more complaints against
 
06:56:39.590 --> 06:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
guardian adult items i also don't
 
06:56:41.670 --> 06:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
understand the language you know if i
 
06:56:43.590 --> 06:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
take out the some of the words the right
 
06:56:45.990 --> 06:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
to approve to the appropriate licensing
 
06:56:47.830 --> 06:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
board the right to refuse to the
 
06:56:49.350 --> 06:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate licensing board i don't even
 
06:56:50.628 --> 06:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
know what that means
 
06:56:53.030 --> 06:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
i mean i get the the right to approve
 
06:56:55.270 --> 06:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
report to but i don't know why we have
 
06:56:57.590 --> 06:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
approve and refuse in there
 
06:56:57.600 --> 06:56:58.948 align:start position:0%
approve and refuse in there
and

06:56:58.948 --> 06:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:57:01.190 --> 06:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
this notion this additional thing of if
 
06:57:03.110 --> 06:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's no satisfactory response i'm
 
06:57:04.628 --> 06:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
sure this has already come to
 
06:57:06.310 --> 06:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
everybody's on this committee's thought
 
06:57:07.430 --> 06:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
but obviously there's going to need to
 
06:57:09.190 --> 06:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
be a fiscal note because you're talking
 
06:57:12.150 --> 06:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
about creating an entire new division i
 
06:57:15.910 --> 06:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
would suggest uh with great deference to
 
06:57:17.350 --> 06:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
the parties that are here today i
 
06:57:19.110 --> 06:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
understand that family law can be a very
 
06:57:21.670 --> 06:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
very difficult process to go through
 
06:57:21.680 --> 06:57:22.628 align:start position:0%
very difficult process to go through
um

06:57:22.628 --> 06:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:57:24.310 --> 06:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
but that if a complaint has been to the
 
06:57:25.830 --> 06:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
guardian light on board and the
 
06:57:27.270 --> 06:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
professional conduct committee and
 
06:57:29.110 --> 06:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the court and everyone has
 
06:57:31.270 --> 06:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
said there's nothing there maybe there
 
06:57:33.750 --> 06:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
isn't a need for another board who will
 
06:57:36.070 --> 06:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
also review those complaints so thank
 
06:57:37.510 --> 06:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you any
 
06:57:37.520 --> 06:57:45.990 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you any
questions

06:57:45.990 --> 06:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:47.510 --> 06:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
06:57:49.990 --> 06:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time
 
06:58:11.670 --> 06:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:13.430 --> 06:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your time
 
06:58:15.430 --> 06:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's been a long day for everybody so i
 
06:58:17.910 --> 06:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to thank you
 
06:58:20.390 --> 06:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
um i i left my glasses back there so
 
06:58:23.670 --> 06:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
please bear with me for a moment
 
06:58:26.548 --> 06:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
oh thanks thanks thanks i knew that was
 
06:58:28.468 --> 06:58:28.478 align:start position:0%
gonna be the issue by the end of the day
 
06:58:28.478 --> 06:58:30.868 align:start position:0%
gonna be the issue by the end of the day
okay

06:58:30.868 --> 06:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:32.390 --> 06:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
all right now that we've had comic
 
06:58:32.400 --> 06:58:33.510 align:start position:0%
all right now that we've had comic
relief

06:58:33.510 --> 06:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
relief
 
06:58:33.520 --> 06:58:35.270 align:start position:0%
relief
um

06:58:35.270 --> 06:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:37.510 --> 06:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
so on this basically i'm just going to
 
06:58:40.310 --> 06:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
cover a few quick points that's it
 
06:58:42.868 --> 06:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need to
 
06:58:45.270 --> 06:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
to extend too much on this one
 
06:58:48.230 --> 06:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
i reiterate from my previous statements
 
06:58:49.430 --> 06:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
not just this testimony but the
 
06:58:51.270 --> 06:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
testimony of the past 12 years that i've
 
06:58:53.910 --> 06:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
provided to the committees
 
06:58:56.390 --> 06:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
the gao is a private citizen with
 
06:58:56.400 --> 06:58:57.750 align:start position:0%
the gao is a private citizen with
immunity

06:58:57.750 --> 06:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
06:59:01.670 --> 06:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:03.350 --> 06:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
in my case
 
06:59:05.990 --> 06:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
the discovery process of the divorce
 
06:59:09.270 --> 06:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
which ended his appointment
 
06:59:15.030 --> 06:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:18.150 --> 06:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
the gal spent a significant amount of
 
06:59:19.910 --> 06:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
time post-divorce even possibly
 
06:59:19.920 --> 06:59:22.150 align:start position:0%
time post-divorce even possibly
pre-divorce

06:59:22.150 --> 06:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
pre-divorce
 
06:59:24.708 --> 06:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
with the other party
 
06:59:27.670 --> 06:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
the gal testified
 
06:59:31.270 --> 06:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
toward the end of our 12 years
 
06:59:32.788 --> 06:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
when my daughter was kidnapped out of
 
06:59:34.468 --> 06:59:34.478 align:start position:0%
the state
 
06:59:36.708 --> 06:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
he testified to the last three years of
 
06:59:40.868 --> 06:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
her life when he had no contact with her
 
06:59:43.830 --> 06:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
so the discrepancies in what's actually
 
06:59:43.840 --> 06:59:45.590 align:start position:0%
so the discrepancies in what's actually
happening

06:59:45.590 --> 06:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
happening
 
06:59:48.548 --> 06:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
and what we know people can do
 
06:59:50.628 --> 06:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
or should be doing
 
07:00:05.750 --> 07:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:11.430 --> 07:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:13.510 --> 07:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
for me personally i got
 
07:00:17.110 --> 07:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
no record despite repeated requests of
 
07:00:18.390 --> 07:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
all the billing
 
07:00:21.110 --> 07:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
i never got any billing records at all
 
07:00:22.548 --> 07:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
from him
 
07:00:24.628 --> 07:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
i never got any
 
07:00:27.110 --> 07:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
records after repeated requests of his
 
07:00:27.120 --> 07:00:28.708 align:start position:0%
records after repeated requests of his
file

07:00:28.708 --> 07:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
file
 
07:00:31.190 --> 07:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding we're allowed to
 
07:00:32.708 --> 07:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
have that
 
07:00:39.670 --> 07:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:42.788 --> 07:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
i don't know i cannot tell you what his
 
07:00:45.750 --> 07:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
true total was that he accumulated in 12
 
07:00:45.760 --> 07:00:47.990 align:start position:0%
true total was that he accumulated in 12
years

07:00:47.990 --> 07:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:00:50.628 --> 07:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
including the two years that i
 
07:00:53.510 --> 07:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned in my case summary
 
07:00:55.430 --> 07:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
that he functioned post-divorce
 
07:00:58.070 --> 07:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
immediately post-divorce was functioning
 
07:01:01.670 --> 07:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
with the court and never reappointed
 
07:01:03.830 --> 07:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
but the court allowed all of it
 
07:01:03.840 --> 07:01:05.590 align:start position:0%
but the court allowed all of it
regardless

07:01:05.590 --> 07:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
07:01:07.750 --> 07:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
so there are discrepancies and i'd like
 
07:01:09.270 --> 07:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
to believe that everybody is there for
 
07:01:11.030 --> 07:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
the right purposes
 
07:01:12.468 --> 07:01:12.478 align:start position:0%
but in my case
 
07:01:15.910 --> 07:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
everything went completely sideways
 
07:01:17.670 --> 07:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the guardian at
 
07:01:17.680 --> 07:01:19.350 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the guardian at
lightham

07:01:19.350 --> 07:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
lightham
 
07:01:21.750 --> 07:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
i think they're an evil necessity with a
 
07:01:25.030 --> 07:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:28.150 --> 07:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
they are not a casa
 
07:01:30.070 --> 07:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
guardian item
 
07:01:32.070 --> 07:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
so i think the billing when you're
 
07:01:34.468 --> 07:01:34.478 align:start position:0%
talking about a private contractor is
 
07:01:37.990 --> 07:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
very very critical to be overseen
 
07:01:39.830 --> 07:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
to avoid
 
07:01:42.230 --> 07:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
undermining the court process and our
 
07:01:44.948 --> 07:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
belief in the system
 
07:01:46.868 --> 07:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
with that said i'm going to end today
 
07:01:47.670 --> 07:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
and i
 
07:01:50.548 --> 07:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
god you guys have a great night
 
07:01:53.670 --> 07:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
07:01:56.948 --> 07:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
07:01:59.510 --> 07:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
and our final although she
 
07:02:01.350 --> 07:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
gave us two cards
 
07:02:04.230 --> 07:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
you only get two minutes
 
07:02:10.948 --> 07:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:13.830 --> 07:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
sorry it is a long day here
 
07:02:15.830 --> 07:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you guys taking the time to
 
07:02:17.510 --> 07:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
um meet with us
 
07:02:19.670 --> 07:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
so in this particular bill i do support
 
07:02:21.270 --> 07:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
it because i see the effects that it had
 
07:02:24.310 --> 07:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
on me my friends and their children
 
07:02:27.270 --> 07:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
during my divorce in 2014 the court
 
07:02:29.830 --> 07:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
family court ordered a gal
 
07:02:31.910 --> 07:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
my experience was concerning
 
07:02:34.230 --> 07:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
as my gal tried to pull my children away
 
07:02:37.510 --> 07:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
from me based on a false police report
 
07:02:39.830 --> 07:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
divorce with or without children is
 
07:02:43.510 --> 07:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
stressful a gal has many influences on
 
07:02:45.910 --> 07:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
the future of your children and is
 
07:02:48.830 --> 07:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary in many
 
07:02:51.350 --> 07:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
cases in my case
 
07:02:54.150 --> 07:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
my gal was very biased
 
07:02:56.628 --> 07:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
she did not have equal visits to both
 
07:02:56.638 --> 07:02:57.910 align:start position:0%
she did not have equal visits to both
homes

07:02:57.910 --> 07:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
homes
 
07:02:59.510 --> 07:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
she did not look into the false police
 
07:02:59.520 --> 07:03:00.548 align:start position:0%
she did not look into the false police
report

07:03:00.548 --> 07:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
report
 
07:03:03.430 --> 07:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
she did not look into the false dcyf
 
07:03:03.440 --> 07:03:06.310 align:start position:0%
she did not look into the false dcyf
reports

07:03:06.310 --> 07:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:07.990 --> 07:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
i was fortunate that i didn't have the
 
07:03:10.390 --> 07:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
outcomes that could have very easily and
 
07:03:12.150 --> 07:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted
 
07:03:13.590 --> 07:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
my time with my daughters and the
 
07:03:13.600 --> 07:03:15.110 align:start position:0%
my time with my daughters and the
decisions

07:03:15.110 --> 07:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
07:03:16.628 --> 07:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
i hope that i will never have to go
 
07:03:18.708 --> 07:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
through a gal again
 
07:03:21.430 --> 07:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
but based on the harassment that i've
 
07:03:23.910 --> 07:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
i've experienced it scares me to death
 
07:03:26.070 --> 07:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
because i probably will end up back in
 
07:03:27.750 --> 07:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
court again
 
07:03:32.548 --> 07:03:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:35.030 --> 07:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
you have heard their testimony it's very
 
07:03:38.390 --> 07:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
concerning to say the least
 
07:03:40.788 --> 07:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
they are just a few of what
 
07:03:43.510 --> 07:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
few that have been traumatized but
 
07:03:43.520 --> 07:03:44.390 align:start position:0%
few that have been traumatized but
a

07:03:44.390 --> 07:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:03:47.110 --> 07:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
gal my hope is that with all the

testimonies that all of us shared this
 
07:03:51.750 --> 07:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
will make an impact on the family court
 
07:03:54.390 --> 07:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
these laws will help our children lead a
 
07:03:57.030 --> 07:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
better life

07:04:14.868 --> 07:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
victims by pulling

a parent
 
07:04:18.548 --> 07:04:18.558 align:start position:0%
