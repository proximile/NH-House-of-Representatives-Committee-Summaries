00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
going so Senator Morris typically the
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
committee of conference proceeds by
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
saying sections we've agreed on in hp2
 
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
we pass through as agreement we do have
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
a couple of SE sections I know we've
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
talked about HB
 
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
14 sections 14 and 15 but we didn't
 
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
agree on 15 that you amended it so I'd
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
like to move those forward and then I
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
would like to go through as we normally
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
do if either side has an issue with a
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
section we will just say hold put it on
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
hold if we have something to discuss we
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
can discuss it is that acceptable with
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate yes
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
okay we are going to start with our side
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
by side which is a mere 300 plus pages
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
so we're going to just zip right through
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
hours we have actually House and Senate
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
agreed on every section down to section
 
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
14 which was the same I will tell you
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
that when division one me meets with
 
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.590 align:start position:0%
that when division one me meets with
their

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
groups we
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
send a letter to all of them and we say
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through your budget we
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
want to know if you have issues with
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
anything in hb2 we want to know if
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
something needs to be added to hb2 you
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
should be prepared to answer these
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
budget questions as well as any other
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
question New Hampshire retirement system
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
came to us with those same Provisions
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
they had no issues with section 14 and
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
we passed those on to the Senate because
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
they were approved the Senate worked on
 
00:16:36.749 --> 00:16:36.759 align:start position:0%
them and I believe there started to be
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
an issue from the retirement
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
system about Senate bill hb2 14 and 15
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
when it was in the Senate they sent me a
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
letter in June four months after we had
 
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
met with them saying Oh we have an issue
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
here so we've looked at it fairly ex
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
extensively worked with the groups and
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%

Amendment

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
1937 H is an amendment to house bill to
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
from representative obber um what this
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
so sections 14 and 15 is representative
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
overstated uh has to do with the
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh the medical
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
benefits and uh how the various members
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
actually pay uh for their portions uh
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
there is a um a current discussion going
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
on between between Das and retirement
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
system um as a result there was section
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
14 and 15 were put into house bill two
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh but there was a concern as
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative over stated relative to a
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
potential impact on the tax qualified
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
status of the retirement plan uh
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
retirement system did send a letter
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
which they did recommend um if these
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
sections were in that there should be a
 
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
uh tax determination letter from the IRS
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
um should be sought by the Retirement
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
Systems and so what this section will do
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
is its contingent implementation so no
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
change to section 1415 but basically
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
those sections will take effect uh 90
 
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
days after the receipt of a favorable
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
determination letter is presented to uh
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
the fiscal Committee of the general
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
court um and this is just to ensure that
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
the state does not impact the tax
 
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
favorable status of the retirement
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%

00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
from what the house
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
had I'm not my green dress today but I
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
am always jealous that you guys have
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
plan and we are now flipping Pages where
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
we are in in total agreement between the
 
00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:56.389 align:start position:0%
we are in in total agreement between the
two

00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.399 --> 00:29:12.310 align:start position:0%
 
bills

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
71 section
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
112 while the house was in total
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
agreement with the Senate we had s
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
sp3 which passed and was signed into
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
law so we no longer need this
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
in this section and Mr
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
Cain there is an amendment to delete
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
this section because this is already law
 
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
and I've have already lost a piece of
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
paper so I don't know the number can we
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
just pass it out yes we will pass that
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:02.389 align:start position:0%
 
much

00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
so the amendment number that's being
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
handed out is
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
1900h which as representative over
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
stated deletes the PPP section since a
 
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
bill has been signed into
 
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
law so
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
move Senator Morse moves speaker Packard
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
seconds the house if you're in favor
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
please raise your
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
our vote is unanimous we were delighted
 
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
earlier Mr Kane we're on page
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
72 and we have Senate Amendment 113 the
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax and this is revenue
 
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
sharing and I believe under what the
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
Senate was able to do we're going to be
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
sending more money to the towns is that
 
00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
true and could you tell us a little bit
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
correct so senate pass sections
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
113 as well as references contained in
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
114 and
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
115 uh what that does is it carves out
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
30% of all meals and rooms Revenue
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
collections into a new dedicated fund
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
for municipal
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
distribution uh that ended up increasing
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
it will increase the distributions to
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
cities and towns by about 35 million
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
over the bium uh this will be a non
 
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
budgeted restricted account um so you
 
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
will see that carved out of the general
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
fund revenues prior to the um beginning
 
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year so this actually
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
provides a way for towns to have a more
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
reliable stream if you will of Revenue
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
sharing that will be coming to them
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
instead of worrying year year by year is
 
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
that true
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
correct Senator rosenal thank you I'm
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
not opposed to this but it does reduce
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
the percentage of rooms and meals tax
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
that goes to the cities and towns I know
 
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
we haven't hit that in a while but um I
 
00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:14.519 align:start position:0%
think we should recognize that dedicated
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
funds get
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
suspended frequently by the
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
legislature and um so I want to note
 
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
that I have a concern about the
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
sustainability going forward because of
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
all of the tax cuts that are contained
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
within House Bill too Senator Madam
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
chair yeah I just want to make it clear
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
what happened here we're sending 188
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
million back to our communities which is
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
an additional $50 million that's
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
included in this budget um so I I
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
support it 100% And I would hope future
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
legislator fight to get to 40% to be
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
honest with you but um 30% was with we
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
believed we could talk to the house and
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
the municipal
 
00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
Association um to do some good in this
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
budget and we
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
did the house is happy to acceed to the
 
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.389 align:start position:0%
did the house is happy to acceed to the
Senate

00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation I'd like to turn to page
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
75 at this
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
point this is a new section with a
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
commission to study and limiting the
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
business tax carryover um representative
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
major would you like to speak to this m
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
Kane why don't you tell us what it does
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
around sure so on page 76 of the side by
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
side um it is section
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
118 of the senate pass version and this
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
is the commission to study limiting the
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
business tax credit carryover uh
 
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
business tax credit carryover is sums in
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of $300 million plus or minus
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh every year that businesses carry
 
00:33:57.389 --> 00:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
forward on what they pay um through
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
their business profits tax so um what
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
this commission would do is to study uh
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
the use of that credit u there's also a
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
section prior to that that does phase
 
00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
down that credit over several years what
 
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
the Senate added on page 76 in yellow is
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
that the commission shall also examine
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
whether a business tax credit or other
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
type of credit could be made available
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
to those entities using their credit
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
carryover refund to invest in affordable
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
housing development so it's an
 
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
additional um resp responsibility of the
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
commission thank you represent major
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
would you like to
 
00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:37.149 align:start position:0%
would you like to
comment

00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
yes is that on if you hold the button
 
00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:42.510 align:start position:0%
yes is that on if you hold the button
down

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
okay yes credit carryover has been
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
climbing each year just a few years ago
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
was like
 
00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:50.909 align:start position:0%
was like
A40

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:50.919 align:start position:0%
A40
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
million now as said is approaching $300
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
million that is a great a good
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
percentage of our business profits
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
tax and all of a sudden if things got
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
worse for the corporations they could
 
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
ask for that money back and all of a
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
sudden we have a big hole in our budget
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
because we go on a on a cash basis and
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
this is figured into our cash
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
basis so it's money that we really
 
00:35:27.069 --> 00:35:27.079 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have but been held by us one
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
good thing for the uh corporations if
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
they have excess funds they they they
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
can park it in the state and not have to
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
worry about bringing it back and paying
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
their corporate taxes on
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
that well this is good good Amendment
 
00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.430 align:start position:0%
that well this is good good Amendment
Senator

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
moris the Senate just plain ran out of
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
time and I know it'll be a debate later
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
why the Senate put 25 million
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
additionally into affordable housing
 
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
fund but but the intention was that as
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
time moves on that we encourage
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
businesses and this is probably 50 of
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
the largest businesses in New Hampshire
 
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
to start to build on their own um we
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
looked into Dartmouth they're building
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
like 300 units over there for their own
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
employees um somehow if we could have
 
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
come up with a plan to put this 25
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
million um into play and have businesses
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
use the money they've already sank into
 
00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
the government and take it out and do
 
00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
developments to help with their own
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
planning um I think it would be
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the state of New Hampshire
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
um and that's where we're headed it's
 
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
going to take a little while longer I
 
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
would think in January we' come back and
 
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.150 align:start position:0%
would think in January we' come back and
address

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
question my question is just an
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
observation is that I wasn't aware of
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
this this part of the
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:01.470 align:start position:0%
this this part of the
amendment

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead there is no part we basically
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
think the legisl needs to come back and
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
debate this because the reality is you
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
accounted for 20 million coming out of
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
that Fund in your budget um because they
 
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
were at 280 I believe is that the number
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's in there um and the house
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
accounted for that we thought that was a
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
great idea but what we'd like to suggest
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
if these businesses are going to start
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
taking money out of there they could
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
take that and this is going to be future
 
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
legislation we're not there yet and
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
apply for housing credits which there
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
are no dollars to do that I mean so we
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
thought that that might be a solution
 
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature could come back in
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
January and work on so that the 280
 
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
would start to come down in a manner
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
that is good for the State of New
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're not there yet but that's
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
why we did it that way and that's why we
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
took 2021 monies and put it away um if
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
it gets spent before then obviously uh
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity so this puts together as I
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
understand this a study committee to
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
start looking at that and maybe making
 
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
some recommendations for future
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is that true Senator
 
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
legislation is that true Senator
Morris

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
Morris
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.270 align:start position:0%
Morris
yes

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
okay the house exceeds to that section
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
thank you on page 77 we do have a
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
question we had house section
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
111 which dealt with New Hampshire veter
 
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
Home per DM
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
payments Mr Kane did that get put into
 
00:38:50.309 --> 00:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
the budget as a footnote or handled in
 
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
some other way yes that's included in
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
house bill one as a footnote on the
 
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home accounts so they can they
 
00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to adjust their payments or
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
their Appropriations based on per deem
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
payment levels so was a duplicate
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
section that was
 
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.870 align:start position:0%
section that was
removed

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
okay um we're going to turn now to page
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
78 we have some questions on 112 and 13
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
again these are New Hampshire Veterans
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
Home waivers Mr Kane what can you tell
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
us about those yes uh same discussion
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
relative to these um there were two
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
sections duplicate sections changes to
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
rsas that were not necessary uh Veterans
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
Home has given broader transfer
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
Authority than other agencies and are
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
exempt from certain rsas um they have
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
one section that does allow them to do
 
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
section uh 122 and so there was no need
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
Senate section 122 so there no need for
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
the other sections the Senate deleted
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
so Senate section
 
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
122 takes care of these two sections and
 
00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839 align:start position:0%
these could be deleted but they would
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
still have the same right correct that's
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
correct representative Edwards we're
 
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.550 align:start position:0%

00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
Along on page
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
80 the Senate did not use house section
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
117 I've had a question a a request to
 
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
hold that and and have a discussion
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
again there are some things that the
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
house had put in that were taken out our
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
section 126 which was about the workers
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
comp appeals board and our section 128
 
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
which was about um a new program that we
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
thought should be in there for
 
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships have been passed into
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%

150 this is a quorum change a very small
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
change and it specifies who will

00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
correct representative V Berger yes so
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
while there is no change there was also
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
a section in division two that division
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
this came to division one that division
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
one was unaware of starting a program in
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
the police training and standards as
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative umberger said this
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
morning so she is going to get a little
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
Amendment and Mr Caine if you could hold
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
that which is one section 158 on
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative amberger uh
 
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm sorry Senator BR we
 
00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:14.839 align:start position:0%
only had 300 pages to go
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
through I should have written that in
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
red I had it in black and it just zipped
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
by all right we we would like on page
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
125 there's one small change in
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph three the the house had
 
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
administrative Technical and staff
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
support and we certainly see that staff
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
is redundant to
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
administrative however we were concerned
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
about the removal of technical support
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
and we wondered what the thought process
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
Senate I don't either I would move we a
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
seed to the house position
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
I'll second that representative Senator
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
Bradley moves that we exceed to the
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
house position by adding technical back
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
in and I have seconded that is there any
 
00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:11.390 align:start position:0%
in and I have seconded that is there any
discussion

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
unanimous and
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
now we have section after section that
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%

128 while you remove technical you said
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
all necessary support so we are going to
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
exceed to both of
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
those and we're now going to turn to

129 we were the same on page 130 and
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
131 we would ask the senate or LBA for a
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
little help Mr Kane this is on page
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
132 yes they added no change to house
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
language p rsaa 12- p col 10 and they
 
00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:58.799 align:start position:0%
added a c reference but they left out I
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
believe what we had for 11 so can you
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
explain to me and to us what was going
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
on here I'm gonna ask Mike Hoffman if he
 
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
can verify if not I believe this was
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
part of a larger governor's office
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment provided to the Senate but um
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
I'll see if Mike can help
 
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
out yes excuse me good morning um that
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
note is just there to indicate the two
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
side by sides didn't line up very well
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
so several Pages down you'll see the
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
Senate has a section 12 p15 that is the
 
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
same language it just doesn't align up
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:49.799 align:start position:0%
out and and that is on page
 
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
134 yeah and Mike on page
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
the language we had for 12- p col 11 on
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:20.829 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes and we have a reference change on
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
page 134 as well
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
cleanup represented over representative
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
umberger um I thought we were going to
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
ask about taking out
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
um 12p 13 authority to contract for
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
power well we're trying to work through
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
that so okay I Mr Hoffman could you hear
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
do you have the mic on Ken yes I do
 
00:50:56.349 --> 00:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
could you hear representative umberger
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
she was asking about 12
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
p113 which we believe was in the house
 
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
section and came from the
 
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
there and how many amendments did you
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
make on this at least
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
35 at
 
00:51:22.109 --> 00:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
least 12 p133 on at the bottom of page
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
133 on the house
 
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:38.030 align:start position:0%
133 on the house
side

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
and yes you're correct that I was
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
confusing it with the other section
 
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:49.990 align:start position:0%
confusing it with the other section
that's

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
duplicated did that language go the
 
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
Senate with it removed from the
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
Jud um Mr Elms is here from the
 
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
governor's office we wish the governor's
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
budget director the very best he
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
actually got married on Saturday so
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
Chris Elms is here to help us Chris can
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:31.589 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
okay so it was
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
removed I know you can't hear him if
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
you're at home doesn't have a microphone
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
it was removed because that has been
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
eliminated with restructuring but
 
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
136 the house had language from the
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
governor's office that
 
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
originally repealed the
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
OSI revolving funds however as this went
 
00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
Senate it was discovered that they
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
needed it they not only needed it they
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
had to make some RSA changes so the
 
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
house is exceeding to the Senate
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
language one section 190 revolves around
 
00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:48.670 align:start position:0%
language one section 190 revolves around
that

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
191 and we exceed to those as well the
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
next section we were the same on
 
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
now we turn to
 
00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
Mike I can't tell you how many times
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
this weekend I read this section yes so
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
let me start with in line
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
two it says shall be appointed by the
 
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner I thought directors but I
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
didn't hunt up the law and the rsas were
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
nominated by Commissioners and actually
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
appointed through the
 
00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
GNC uh some are uh but there are some
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
that are uh appointed directly by the
 
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner so these ones would not
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
require uh GNC
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
approval okay now my next
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
question it says the following positions
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
are hereby established y y and shall be
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
appointed by the commissioner and
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
perform assigned duties applicable to
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
law and then it lists the director of
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
regular regulatory Support Enforcement
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
policy and programs director of
 
00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
administration Deputy of the
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner of energy and then it
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
appears that the commissioner is
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
so should we perhaps change that would
 
00:55:26.109 --> 00:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
you like a motion Madam chair yes we
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
that we delete that line I think it's 9u
 
00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
9968 I would second that motion that
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
would delete the commissioner appointing
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
himself the house is in favor raise your
 
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
Senate and we we will move section
 
00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.910 align:start position:0%
Senate and we we will move section
193

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
193
 
00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:53.789 align:start position:0%
193
on

00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.549 --> 00:55:57.559 align:start position:0%
happle okay okay
 
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
um what happened here is basically
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
Senate section 19 194 move much of house
 
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
SE section 187 over and the house
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
exceeds to that
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
language at the bottom of the page
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
138 there is section 195 and I think
 
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
they change on that
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page 143 and again this
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
cleans up the language for the revolving
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
funds that needed to be done that the
 
00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
house had deleted only because the
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
governor had originally told us they
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
didn't need them so the house is
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
exceeding to that
 
00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
language which brings us
 
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
to page
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
144 and we are happily back into
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
145 section
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
198 cleans up rsas and one RSA reference
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
is a council on resources and
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
development that the house didn't have
 
00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.039 align:start position:0%
but it was there and the house exceeds
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
to oops I flipped the page going the
 
00:57:45.079 --> 00:57:52.470 align:start position:0%
to oops I flipped the page going the
wrong

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.789 --> 00:57:55.799 align:start position:0%
way that's the page
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
yeah 148 and I can't it flip shut when I
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
moved it
 
00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
around okay page 148 representative wlo
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
you wanted to discuss the chief engineer
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
which apparently doesn't exist
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
anymore well I believe that the
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
makeup I believe the makeup of the
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission should be
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
one engineer one accountant and one
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
lawyer that's where it was for many
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
years and now they're taking out the
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
engineer I think it's very important
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
board I was told that the chief engineer
 
00:58:39.029 --> 00:58:39.039 align:start position:0%
was out because there hadn't been one
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
for quite a while I believe that's
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
correct but could we hear from the
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
that so there's no even chief engineer
 
00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
position allocated to this agency is
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
me do you want to ask him to confirm
 
00:59:14.589 --> 00:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
that and hold it representative wer yes
 
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
sure and if I could just point out this
 
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
has to do not with the appointment of
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
the commission but relative to
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on employment after leaving
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
the commission and so it removes that
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
prohibition from the chief engineer
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
position as opposed to removing the
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
chief engineer all it does is remove a
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
Prohibition from that chief engineer uh
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
relative future employment does that
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
make you feel
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
exceed we can exceed the house exceeds
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
to the Senate language Chris you don't
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
now we'll we'll come up with something
 
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.109 align:start position:0%
now we'll we'll come up with something
else

00:59:58.109 --> 00:59:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
all right we are again going through
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
pages of Department of energy where the
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
were in complete agreement on page
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
156 section
 
01:00:14.559 --> 01:00:16.549 align:start position:0%
156 section
222

01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
222
 
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
deletes one position the house would
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:28.349 align:start position:0%
 
why

01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
was this did this come from the
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
governor to the Senate asking for the
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
change so this came from the governor to
 
01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.910 align:start position:0%
change so this came from the governor to
the

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
Senate there an objection to exceeding
 
01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.470 align:start position:0%
Senate there an objection to exceeding
house

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
Senate page
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
158 site evaluation goes back to normal
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
page 160 is a reference change that was
 
01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
corrected is that correct Mr Kane
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
correct the house exceeds to the
 
01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.349 align:start position:0%
correct the house exceeds to the
reference

01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
change okay on bottom of page 162
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
section 236 was amended you'll find that
 
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
change on the bottom of page26 and
 
01:01:22.109 --> 01:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
basically what they have done is they
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
have scratched commission and added at
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
164 and changed it to Department of
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
language oh my friends we get to the
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:53.559 align:start position:0%
168 the house would like to hold on that
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
I have an amend M Mr
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
Kaine could we just pass the amendment
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
out for the Senate to have to look at
 
01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
over there L yes we will pass that on
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's amendment
 
01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.430 align:start position:0%
that's amendment
20211

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
901h I don't want you to fall on the
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
floor and get a red face right here in
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
why that's because I don't like
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated when there's a
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
vet so if I could make a suggestion to
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
this amendment that you could um I would
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
be okay with this uh representative over
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
as long as there was a sentence added to
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
it that
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
expedited um the Pu coming to
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
I knew you were going to get me on
 
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
peeve so he would like
 
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
to yes if you just um sorry if you want
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair uh I will give you that
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
sentence after lunch okay let's do that
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.279 --> 01:03:29.470 align:start position:0%
 
hold

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:32.839 align:start position:0%
okay we now are back to flipping Pages
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
where we were in total
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
agreement we get to page
 
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
172 and this is a minor change but when
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
the house looked through these many
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
pages and many sections we failed to
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
notice that the expenses of the office
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
of commissioner Advocate which are
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
currently being paid have been left out
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate has added that and the house
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
Senate on page
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
248 and all the Senate changed in that
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
was to add the words or the department
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
to clarify the
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
language we will
 
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.829 align:start position:0%
language we will
exceed

01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
exceed
 
01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:29.079 --> 01:04:30.710 align:start position:0%
 
Senate

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%

01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
177 Senate section 251 which relates to
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
house section
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
242 the house had repealed the ru making
 
01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
authority of the Public Utilities
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
Commission the Senate eliminated that
 
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
but Mr Kaine they added paragraph two
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
can you tell us what that does
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
please I would defer to the governor's
 
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
office that was a request by the
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
01:05:14.029 --> 01:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
one okay we will hold
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%

01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
um with maintaining the reference to the
 
01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:50.839 align:start position:0%

wer question for a while there was a
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
charge on our phone bills to support
 
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
these public interest pay phones has
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
that been removed or will it be removed
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
repeal thank
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
you anybody else represent Burger thank
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
you madam chair he said the dedicated
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
fund had been
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
repealed I believe he did Mr elms did
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
you say the dedicated fund had been
 
01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:04.229 align:start position:0%
you say the dedicated fund had been
repealed

01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
yes yes that is chapter 19 of the 21
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
session that was formerly House Bill
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
134 so basically we're saying that in
 
01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire there will be
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
no more
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
pays no more public interest
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
pays I don't care what they are
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's Mr Kane do you have any idea I
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
believe it was a fund relative to public
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
interest specific pay phones that hasn't
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
been used it was inactive for several
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
years and so as part of the dedicated
 
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
fund uh Review Committee um they removed
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
that specific dedicated fund but didn't
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
change any other statute relative to
 
01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.750 align:start position:0%
change any other statute relative to
payones

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
payones
 
01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
so you might so what you're saying is
 
01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
that it was only the public interest pay
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
phones and not all pay
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
phones yes correct for that fund correct
 
01:11:08.189 --> 01:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
Mr hel Elms is also shaking his head
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you not that I use them
 
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
but I might okay this past the Senate
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
8 I've been ask to remind everybody to
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
pull your microphones close to you
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
somehow it's not going out to the world
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
and we have these big books in front of
 
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
us so that makes it a little difficult
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
but we'll do the best we can thank you
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
Erin we had investigative orders which
 
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
came to us from the
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
governor and it was removed and I assume
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
that removal is because it came to the
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
Senate that we didn't need this Mr Elms
 
01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.270 align:start position:0%
Senate that we didn't need this Mr Elms
can

01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:12:07.229 --> 01:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
you say is that
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
true all right the house then is okay
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
with that wasn't there to start with so
 
01:12:16.629 --> 01:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
we're on page
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
200202 no
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
changes we get to the bottom of page
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
204 this was amended by the Senate and I
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
209 Mr Kaine they removed some language
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
The house's question was was that
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
language in an RSA or was it just an
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
order uh it was in an RSA and I believe
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
this was um Senator Bradley of Rose MD
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
relative to a pu former pu order that is
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
they still wanted to refer to because
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh this has to do with uh
 
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
commission order number 25932 dated
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
August 2nd 2016 relative to Energy
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
Efficiency resource standard uh that's
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
in current RSA now the house had I think
 
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
based on discussions with the government
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
had removed that the senate had an
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to add that remove that strike
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
through basically to so maintain it as
 
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
the current statute
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
reads so we still have legis ative
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
approval of the New Hampshire general
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
court is that what the law the line
 
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
above that says and that is true that's
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
correct so if I might yes please um we
 
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
were confused so when the
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
um legislature weighed in in terms of
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
approval of any change or the systems
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
benefits charge in the in the future it
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
Exempted this order for the Energy
 
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
Efficiency resource standard so any new
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
program that had a um change in the
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
systems benefits charge would have to be
 
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
approved by the full legislature but not
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
the E okay so we still have full
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
legislative approval of changes to the
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge the restoration
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
of yeah and if I could go back the going
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
way back when um to the restructuring
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
statute the legislature gave explicit
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
authority to the Pu at that time to move
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
forward with changes to the systems
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
benefits charge so what we did I think
 
01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
you and I worked on this together
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative over a couple of years
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
ago took that authorization back but the
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
eers was under full pu Authority okay so
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
since we still have full legislative
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
approval which is what we want and we
 
01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
can see that on the Senate side there is
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
a sentence saying
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
change all right we're now flipping
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
Pages where we once again are in total
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
same there was no
 
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
no comparable house
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
section for the electric utility
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
restructuring rate payer protection I
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty clear but Mr Kane
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
could you just walk us through that so
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
understand sorry yes so on page 217
 
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:48.679 align:start position:0%
27 uh section
 
01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
282 uh those were further reference
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
changes that were needed because of the
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
EST estblished under the department of
 
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
energy so you can see the department of
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
energy being rep um the commission being
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
replaced by the department of energy in
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
several instances and that was their
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
Governor's request okay thank you the
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
house will exceed to
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
now zipping through Page 220 on page
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.149 align:start position:0%
 
changes

01:16:25.149 --> 01:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
and I assume that this came also from
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
the governor when the house had
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
it this
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
they the offshore wind industry remained
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
in Department of Business and economic
 
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
Affairs when the Senate got it that was
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
scratched and it was added to the
 
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
energy was that a Governor's request
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
again Mr Mr Hoffman saying yes all right
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
223 and there's section
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
289 and the actual change on
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
that is found on
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
224 and the house had the commission may
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
establish requirements and what the
 
01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
Senate did was clean up the language and
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
say consistent with their statutory
 
01:17:27.629 --> 01:17:27.639 align:start position:0%
Authority the commission and the
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
department of energy May establish
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
requirements and then the rest of the
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
language is the same so the house
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
that on page 291 at the bottom of page
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
224 the Senate added and the department
 
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.629 align:start position:0%
224 the Senate added and the department
of

01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:17:51.629 --> 01:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
that page 225 which is section
 
01:17:59.550 --> 01:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
292 you see on page
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
226 the house said if it and the Senate
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
added if the commission
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
determines which clarifies the language
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.590 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
have the business profits tax single
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
sales factor which the Senate has no
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
comparable Amendment
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
on the house would like to discuss the
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
house sections that were not included
 
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
representative nor major who chairs Ways
 
01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
and Means this was a ways and means
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
request to add to the house so Norm do
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
again

01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:49.629 --> 01:19:49.639 align:start position:0%
Floy sh represent
 
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
major the single sales Factor
 
01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.070 align:start position:0%
major the single sales Factor
the

01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
house um agreed to the single sales
 
01:19:59.950 --> 01:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
Factor but to be
 
01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
implemented not now but in the future
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
years the primary reason for that is
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
that the data that's required to know
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
how much it's going to affect us positiv
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
or negatively is not available the best
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
estimate we have with the
 
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
Dr is $20 million if we implement it now
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
so as it stands it would cost us $20
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
removed Senator moris yeah the Senate
 
01:20:38.669 --> 01:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
did account for several things that they
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
adopted in their budget um we did
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 so the Senate base
 
01:20:59.709 --> 01:20:59.719 align:start position:0%
estimates assumed current law which
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
included this uh single sales Factor um
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
so just in begins in 23 but I don't
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
believe I'll turn around to Chris I
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's 20 million a year
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
like going forward into 24 and 25 um
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
I'll see if Chris can add anything it's
 
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:17.560 align:start position:0%
probably indeterminable as
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative major knows because this
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
is a really tough area for ways means to
 
01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:23.719 align:start position:0%
get their uh handle around Dr as well
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
when they analyze returns but Chris can
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
fill you in on the conversation that so
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
nice of you to put Chris on The Hot Spot
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
well done yes did he he's still there's
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
still there he's running out of the room
 
01:21:36.189 --> 01:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
now I think might cover that and it is
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
indeterminable in the out years the
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
house Ways and Means had an estimate of
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
$20 million in 23 as the impact based on
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
some data that they had received from Dr
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
um but there was still a number of
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
questions and that's why they had asked
 
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
for the um change in law to have it take
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
2025 represent
 
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
wer so did did the senate make a
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
determination based upon the money or is
 
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
this been a request from the
 
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
corporations that we go to a single
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
sales factor and would it be a simpler
 
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
way for the Dr to to compute
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
figures um both they we certainly heard
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
that businesses wanted us to account for
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
this and we were in the position
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
that we could account for this we
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
accounted for payroll protection and
 
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
several other things in the Senate
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
budget um I I I would venture to say the
 
01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
discussions that are going to go on
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and on are going to be about
 
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
all the money senate had to account for
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
and to account for tax reductions um I
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
think was probably the best way to do
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
you does the house want to hold this so
 
01:22:56.669 --> 01:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
you can have another
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
discussion I think it's worth holding
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay the house will hold these
 
01:23:05.229 --> 01:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
sections these sections go through
 
01:23:11.629 --> 01:23:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
236 on page
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
236 the house had the equivalent of
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
626 historical horse racing that passed
 
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
the house house it passed the Senate it
 
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
has been signed into law so it was
 
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
removed from
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
hb2 and you will see that that goes
 
01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:35.110 align:start position:0%
hb2 and you will see that that goes
through

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
pages

01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
pages
 
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
242 where we get
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
to section
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
296 that was the house section 302 and
 
01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
we were in agreement
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
there then we get
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
Norm we get to the top of page
 
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
243 we had again added a section at the
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
request of house Ways and Means on a
 
01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
bill they had starting with Section 303
 
01:24:13.239 --> 01:24:19.310 align:start position:0%
bill they had starting with Section 303
and

01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
304 is the decision we're doing away
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
with the history historic horse
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
racing that has been signed into law is
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct and the
 
01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
senate had removed those sections so no
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
further action is they removed the
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
sections because it was a law and you
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
announced that we exceeded it no I said
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
they removed it I just went through it I
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
didn't say one way or the other they
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
took it out so there weren't any
 
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
sections I was just explaining people at
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
doing yeah was a little difficult so
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
this was a bill that way means had
 
01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
starting with Section
 
01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:01.990 align:start position:0%
starting with Section
303

01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
Norm I would suggest we hold this is
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
because almost looks like a bill that
 
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
was passed last
 
01:25:17.229 --> 01:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
year and um we're doing research on it
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
now okay I
 
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.470 align:start position:0%
now okay I
is

01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
I thought we passed it last year and you
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
guys found some things to clean up I'm
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
trying to remember I know I talked to
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative AB brami when you guys
 
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
asked to put it in because I got the
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
data from him but I'm happy to hold this
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
we come back to it
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
that actually goes through several pages
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
and we've put the whole thing while
 
01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:57.270 align:start position:0%
and we've put the whole thing while
representative

01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:01.109 --> 01:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
it Mr Kaine the house is going to at
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
297

01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
through 299 I think it is and we have an
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that is too soon to discuss
 
01:26:29.109 --> 01:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
but needs to be passed out and given
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
to everyone that's Amendment
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
2021 d19
 
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
35h it's several pages so it's too much
 
01:26:43.149 --> 01:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
to try to go through right here
 
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
everybody needs to have it to think
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
about and read we can distribute that
 
01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:51.189 align:start position:0%
about and read we can distribute that
now

01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%

01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
equivalent of the bill that Ways and
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
Means was working on on the house of
 
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
section there is no comparable SE Senate
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
section did not pass through the Senate
 
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:30.280 align:start position:0%
we did have it we're going to let
 
01:28:33.390 --> 01:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
representative major talk to his team
 
01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
and do a little research at lunch about
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
where we are with
 
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
that so that should take you to through
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:59.790 align:start position:0%

and now at the bottom at
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%

01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
database that the house sent to
 
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
them for a couple of
 
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:19.639 align:start position:0%
reasons after it passed the house the
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Agriculture was notified
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
in writing by the federal government
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
that they would no longer do the data
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
entry they had been doing for him on
 
01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.590 align:start position:0%
entry they had been doing for him on
this

01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
situation and representative Howard

out language that the Senate has put
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
into the bill that the house would would
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
have been agreeable to had that happened
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
at the time because this was a bill
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
passed out of Ena and passed by the
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
house on the floor of the house so these
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
changes for the animal records database
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
are small changes that the house agrees
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
with and the house is going to exceed to
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
those changes many
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%

01:31:56.189 --> 01:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
which brings us to dual and concurrent
 
01:31:56.199 --> 01:31:57.750 align:start position:0%
which brings us to dual and concurrent
enrollment

01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%

264 which the Senate amended on page
 
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
267 representative umberger could you
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
talk to us this was a program
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.679 --> 01:32:22.270 align:start position:0%
 
vetted

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
vetted
 
01:32:25.109 --> 01:32:25.119 align:start position:0%
yes I'll be right there excuse that's
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
forth I can't find it but anyhow two
 
01:32:38.159 --> 01:32:39.669 align:start position:0%
forth I can't find it but anyhow two
page

01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
267 267 is the change to what you put in
 
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
the rest of it I believe uses your
 
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
language and then they added paragraph
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
two on page
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
um basically um I have no problem with
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
the change that the Senate made uh on
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
Dual and concurrent
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment uh in our committee the um
 
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
doe wanted to relinquish their
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility for dual and concurrent
 
01:33:19.109 --> 01:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
enrollment and the Community College was
 
01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
in favor of picking up that respon
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
ibility how do you feel about the
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
language that allows them to
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
to go to fiscal committee and ask for
 
01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.750 align:start position:0%
to go to fiscal committee and ask for
more

01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
money I kind of thought we
 
01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
should budget that appropriately but
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
differently when we did the budget um we
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
did not include if I'm not mistaken 10th
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
grade in the Dual and concurrent
 
01:33:53.199 --> 01:33:54.350 align:start position:0%
grade in the Dual and concurrent
enrollment

01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
program and um that has since been
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
added through
 
01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.229 align:start position:0%
added through
HB

01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
148 which although it hasn't the final
 
01:34:12.109 --> 01:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
vote hasn't been there isn't done I and
 
01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
it's in Committee of conference I'm sure
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
that that will not change and so that's
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's one of the major re reasons
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
why uh I think it should be okay to come
 
01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:26.590 align:start position:0%
why uh I think it should be okay to come
to

01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
um we will have money in the education
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
to take care of this I'm not I'm not
 
01:34:42.669 --> 01:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
particularly worried and we should we
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
out Senator Morris does the sen have any
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
piece good
 
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
job okay and representative umre this
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
goes into section 312 right below and
 
01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
they've added the appropriation shall
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%

sections

01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
we have arrived at section
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
272 which I think is the page I'm sorry
 
01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:43.950 align:start position:0%
272 which I think is the page I'm sorry
page

01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
have Mr C talk to us about the changes
 
01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
but do you have anything to say before
 
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Kane
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
starts uh yippi yippi okay Mr Kane sure
 
01:36:20.109 --> 01:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
section 319 besides saying yippy can you
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
tell us a little bit about sure section
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
319 um from the Senate there were the
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
house had appropriated $9 million for
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
four programs for porman a bridge EMB
 
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
betterment fleet vehicles and winter
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance um and discussions in the
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
Senate that was reduced by $8 million to
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
$1 million and the two programs removed
 
01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
were the additional a porman a
 
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
distributions in the um 4 million for
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
the fuel winter maintenance
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
operations and apparently with a loud
 
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
yipp be the house is exceeding to the
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
senate in this
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
section can I just speak to that fors
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
seconds um I think it was alluded to the
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
other day that there were gimmicks um
 
01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
this was an accounting gimmick that I
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
put in because there were other places
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
that made more sense and I've never
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
funded winter M maintenance to be honest
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
with you um to the full amount I've
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
always made them come back to fiscal
 
01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
because I think we need to understand
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
where they're going each year so
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
um to be honest with you I think the
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
budget has a lot of things like this in
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
it so um I think it was actually we had
 
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
more money to be able to move things
 
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
around so and we are jealous when you do
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
and and I certainly have no problem with
 
01:37:46.270 --> 01:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
what they did in Winter maintenance um
 
01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
kind of makes sense for fiscal to be
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
tracking winter maintenance so we have a
 
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
better understanding when we build
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
budgets right I don't you know I don't
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
and plus they someplace else they gave
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh $50 million so it's
 
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
not like they won't have the dollars
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
available if
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
necessary okay Mr Kane that brings us to
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
the top of page 272 with Section 320 and
 
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
we are going to take a lunch break and
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
we will be on break until one o'clock
 
01:38:21.679 --> 01:38:23.030 align:start position:0%
we will be on break until one o'clock
so

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully it's nice to see faces in the
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
audience but hopefully you can find
 
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
o'clock okay let's make
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%

need to attend at one is you're welcome
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%

until 130 I mean sorry not recess we're

break and we will see you after we eat
 
01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:20.030 align:start position:0%
break and we will see you after we eat
thank

01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%

you

02:49:08.990 --> 02:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:13.710 align:start position:0%
 
I

02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:18.469 align:start position:0%
 
know

02:49:18.469 --> 02:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:28.870 --> 02:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
Chris looks like you're live we're just
 
02:49:30.349 --> 02:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
gonna have Scott take down the screen
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%

02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
right we are
 
02:49:39.190 --> 02:49:39.200 align:start position:0%

02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
nice lunch hope you guys did too
 
02:49:46.990 --> 02:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
yeah ba is passing out two amendments
 
02:49:48.229 --> 02:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
that go
 
02:49:51.670 --> 02:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
you these are the last two adjustments
 
02:49:58.710 --> 02:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
on the department of energy and
 
02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
basically we have
 
02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
904h that
 
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
replicates I think it's Senate Bill 85
 
02:50:14.150 --> 02:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
is that correct Senator Bradley with one
 
02:50:16.510 --> 02:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
small check change uh yes it is and if
 
02:50:18.790 --> 02:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
you could point out where the change is
 
02:50:22.429 --> 02:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
moving it to um Bureau of economic
 
02:50:25.150 --> 02:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
Affairs Mr Kane can you point that out
 
02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:27.269 align:start position:0%
Affairs Mr Kane can you point that out
for

02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
us we're moving the Broadband to Bea
 
02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:33.110 align:start position:0%
us we're moving the Broadband to Bea
away

02:50:33.110 --> 02:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:34.870 align:start position:0%
away
[Music]

02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
from Department of
 
02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:43.630 align:start position:0%
from Department of
energy

02:50:43.630 --> 02:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:45.790 align:start position:0%
 
someplace

02:50:45.790 --> 02:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
someplace
 
02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:54.190 align:start position:0%
someplace
they're

02:50:54.190 --> 02:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:56.590 --> 02:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
talking I think this is a brand new
 
02:50:56.600 --> 02:50:58.150 align:start position:0%
talking I think this is a brand new
section

02:50:58.150 --> 02:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
um creating the Broadband matching Grant
 
02:51:03.110 --> 02:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
initiative the Senate Bill 85 I believe
 
02:51:08.110 --> 02:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
it is uh created it under the um office
 
02:51:11.910 --> 02:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
of strategic initiatives was it OSI was
 
02:51:14.830 --> 02:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
OSI and dbea this would create an to the
 
02:51:16.710 --> 02:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
new Department of energy since DBA is
 
02:51:19.630 --> 02:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
going away no we did that you did that
 
02:51:22.190 --> 02:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
we did that in s sp85 okay we need to
 
02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
move it to
 
02:51:26.590 --> 02:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
Bea uh I'm not sure this does that no
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not either yeah
 
02:51:32.070 --> 02:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
dbea with the new Department of energy
 
02:51:34.870 --> 02:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
would not be existing anymore um Bureau
 
02:51:37.790 --> 02:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
of economic Affairs yeah is now getting
 
02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
the planners from OSI they didn't move
 
02:51:43.630 --> 02:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
to Department of energy and it is the
 
02:51:47.070 --> 02:51:47.080 align:start position:0%
planners that will handle the Broadband
 
02:51:49.510 --> 02:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
that correct that's what you and I have
 
02:51:51.150 --> 02:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
agreed to I think that's what the
 
02:51:52.870 --> 02:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
02:51:55.389 --> 02:51:55.399 align:start position:0%
wants okay we'll have to redraft this
 
02:51:58.990 --> 02:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
then uh 1904 does not do
 
02:52:02.030 --> 02:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
that Jeb do we trust them to do that go
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
ahead with the next one yes okay we will
 
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
do that so we'll put that aside and
 
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
we'll go
 
02:52:11.150 --> 02:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
to 202 one-1
 
02:52:15.070 --> 02:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
1942 which transfers one position from
 
02:52:17.110 --> 02:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
one accounting unit to another
 
02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:27.229 --> 02:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
energy and Madam chair I will um move
 
02:52:27.239 --> 02:52:27.950 align:start position:0%
energy and Madam chair I will um move
the

02:52:27.950 --> 02:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.830 --> 02:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
think I I think that um as with the
 
02:52:40.590 --> 02:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
creation of any new Department there may
 
02:52:43.910 --> 02:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
need to be some changes agree um in the
 
02:52:46.710 --> 02:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
future you and I have agreed that we'll
 
02:52:49.269 --> 02:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
if the general counsel position needs
 
02:52:51.830 --> 02:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
further work we'll look at it as
 
02:52:51.840 --> 02:52:53.950 align:start position:0%
further work we'll look at it as
required

02:52:53.950 --> 02:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
required
 
02:52:56.550 --> 02:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely Senator Bradley moves the
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
adoption of amendment 2012 one-1 1942 is

02:53:34.429 --> 02:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:36.429 --> 02:53:36.439 align:start position:0%
320 and this
 
02:53:39.150 --> 02:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
section makes an appropriation to the

Department of
 
02:53:43.309 --> 02:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
Education for school building a we're
 
02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
putting 30 million
 
02:53:49.309 --> 02:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
after a long Hiatus in school building
 
02:53:52.590 --> 02:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
Aid it increases the amount the house
 
02:53:56.150 --> 02:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
had because again the senate had more
 
02:53:58.790 --> 02:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
money and the house has agreed to exceed
 
02:53:59.910 --> 02:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
to this
 
02:54:04.429 --> 02:54:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
321 section 322 at the bottom of the
 
02:54:10.830 --> 02:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
page has no change we've already moved
 
02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:13.269 align:start position:0%
page has no change we've already moved
it

02:54:13.269 --> 02:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:17.269 --> 02:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
on we have some concerns with Section
 
02:54:19.990 --> 02:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
324 representative umberger do you want
 
02:54:23.110 --> 02:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
to talk to this this is we're on page
 
02:54:25.550 --> 02:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
273 this is just the change of an
 
02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:34.269 --> 02:54:34.279 align:start position:0%
section yes um the reason that we use
 
02:54:36.830 --> 02:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
the 1 April date in
 
02:54:41.389 --> 02:54:41.399 align:start position:0%
22 is because this is the first time
 
02:54:45.309 --> 02:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
that Dr will be able to make the
 
02:54:48.830 --> 02:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
adjustments they're well aware of what
 
02:54:52.269 --> 02:54:52.279 align:start position:0%
uh what needs to be done but the actual
 
02:54:55.550 --> 02:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
time when they send out to the
 
02:54:59.070 --> 02:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
communities how much they have to pay in
 
02:55:02.550 --> 02:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh Statewide property tax occurs in
 
02:55:04.349 --> 02:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
April of
 
02:55:07.590 --> 02:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
22 and that's why we use that
 
02:55:10.670 --> 02:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
date we had all kinds of other
 
02:55:15.309 --> 02:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
dates that we we were looking at but uh
 
02:55:19.910 --> 02:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
that was the one that uh worked for Dr
 
02:55:22.910 --> 02:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Kane can you help us shed any lights
 
02:55:24.710 --> 02:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
as well I we understand what
 
02:55:26.550 --> 02:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative hurger and her team did
 
02:55:29.389 --> 02:55:29.399 align:start position:0%
and I don't know exactly where we
 
02:55:31.670 --> 02:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
are can have Mickey answer that question
 
02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:34.030 align:start position:0%
are can have Mickey answer that question
for

02:55:34.030 --> 02:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:37.030 --> 02:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
you he just went to lunch I
 
02:55:40.790 --> 02:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
think well I'm looking at it now um back
 
02:55:42.389 --> 02:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
with the fiscal n worksheet that we
 
02:55:44.269 --> 02:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
received from Dr on House Bill 2 as
 
02:55:46.429 --> 02:55:46.439 align:start position:0%
passed by the house they did identify a
 
02:55:48.349 --> 02:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
technical concern with the date of the
 
02:55:50.110 --> 02:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
effective of those sections being April
 
02:55:53.070 --> 02:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
1 2022 that would be the date of the the
 
02:55:54.830 --> 02:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
warrant for the reduction of the swep
 
02:55:56.429 --> 02:55:56.439 align:start position:0%
would be reflected then I think they had
 
02:55:58.389 --> 02:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
just hoped that the effective date of
 
02:55:59.950 --> 02:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
that law would be sooner so they could
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
actually use it when they calculate out
 
02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
that warrant so that was a technical
 
02:56:06.910 --> 02:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
correction uh that was made at the uh
 
02:56:09.389 --> 02:56:09.399 align:start position:0%
with information Dr provided so
 
02:56:12.070 --> 02:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
basically they needed they asked to have
 
02:56:13.630 --> 02:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
the date changed so that they felt
 
02:56:15.510 --> 02:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable working on it before it was
 
02:56:18.830 --> 02:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
due is that what correct correct yeah
 
02:56:21.229 --> 02:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
this would not this date rate this date
 
02:56:23.870 --> 02:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
um change does not impact when the rate
 
02:56:26.429 --> 02:56:26.439 align:start position:0%
would or excuse me the uh amount would
 
02:56:27.950 --> 02:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
would not change the amount of the $100
 
02:56:30.110 --> 02:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
million reduction in fiscal 23 it just
 
02:56:31.630 --> 02:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
would allow them to calculate it in
 
02:56:35.630 --> 02:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
advance okay thank you I'm sorry I I
 
02:56:38.429 --> 02:56:38.439 align:start position:0%
should have asked Mick no problem in
 
02:56:40.990 --> 02:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
that case the house will exceed yep to
 
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
the change in section
 
02:56:45.269 --> 02:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
324 section
 
02:56:48.710 --> 02:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
325 on the bottom of page 273 actually
 
02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
has the
 
02:56:53.309 --> 02:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
change on
 
02:57:00.750 --> 02:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:04.750 --> 02:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
around we we had some concerns with
 
02:57:09.190 --> 02:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
this Mr Kaine the house felt like this
 
02:57:11.990 --> 02:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
was going to pay people for child care
 
02:57:13.550 --> 02:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
when they weren't putting their children
 
02:57:15.150 --> 02:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
in child child care but we're keeping
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
them at
 
02:57:20.790 --> 02:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
home can you help us understand that um
 
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
I would defer to the Senate to answer
 
02:57:25.349 --> 02:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
that on why that was added
 
02:57:33.190 --> 02:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:37.510 --> 02:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
guys Senator rosenal thank you um I
 
02:57:40.790 --> 02:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
think I my mic on the Senate's thinking
 
02:57:45.070 --> 02:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
was that this is only for children that
 
02:57:48.870 --> 02:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
are actually enrolled in a Child Care
 
02:57:52.429 --> 02:57:52.439 align:start position:0%
Program um but it would allow the
 
02:57:55.469 --> 02:57:55.479 align:start position:0%
centers to be res reimbursed for the
 
02:57:57.070 --> 02:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
days that the
 
02:57:59.710 --> 02:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
child's couldn't come in because someone
 
02:58:02.510 --> 02:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the family was Ill or
 
02:58:06.469 --> 02:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
quarantining or the child was sick
 
02:58:11.070 --> 02:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
itself the department did do this um at
 
02:58:15.910 --> 02:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
least briefly during part of last year
 
02:58:18.910 --> 02:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
um during the stay at home but it does
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
not complement it doesn't contemplate
 
02:58:23.950 --> 02:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
children that aren't enrolled because
 
02:58:27.550 --> 02:58:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:30.349 --> 02:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
work or of Edwards do you want to move
 
02:58:35.269 --> 02:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:38.790 --> 02:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
okay need a micone yes so representative
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:49.070 align:start position:0%
 
seat

02:58:49.070 --> 02:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:50.830 --> 02:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative turkot for
 
02:58:52.190 --> 02:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
letting me have your seat for a moment
 
02:58:55.229 --> 02:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you madam chair I I would say
 
02:58:58.229 --> 02:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
on this subject that while I can
 
02:59:03.309 --> 02:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate um how uh an enrollment based
 
02:59:06.190 --> 02:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
payment method would help the people
 
02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
receiving the funds uh I I I do think
 
02:59:12.710 --> 02:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
that we ought to keep it at um actual
 
02:59:14.469 --> 02:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
attendance policy
 
02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh I think as we look at the future we
 
02:59:19.150 --> 02:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
should look at a bright happy future we
 
02:59:21.870 --> 02:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
have the pandemic increasingly behind us
 
02:59:24.550 --> 02:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
and we shouldn't continue to anticipate
 
02:59:26.990 --> 02:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
things like quarantines and major
 
02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
shutdowns so I I would recommend to my
 
02:59:32.389 --> 02:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
colleagues and my friends in the Senate
 
02:59:33.910 --> 02:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
that we move this back to an
 
02:59:36.590 --> 02:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
attendance-based policy and not
 
02:59:38.990 --> 02:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment represent bumberger did I see
 
02:59:42.190 --> 02:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:45.269 --> 02:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
question yes I did
 
02:59:51.550 --> 02:59:51.560 align:start position:0%
um how how is uh tanith paid
 
02:59:56.469 --> 02:59:56.479 align:start position:0%
now is it based on the days they attend
 
02:59:59.590 --> 02:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
or is it based on the
 
03:00:02.190 --> 03:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
um the fact that
 
03:00:06.070 --> 03:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:09.950 --> 03:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
up the child care reimbursement is based
 
03:00:14.990 --> 03:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
on the days that children are there
 
03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:16.030 align:start position:0%
on the days that children are there
right

03:00:16.030 --> 03:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:00:19.429 --> 03:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
now thank you Senator Morris would the
 
03:00:25.870 --> 03:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
language Senate would like to hold we
 
03:00:33.469 --> 03:00:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:36.389 --> 03:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
hold it's no surprise ladies and
 
03:00:39.670 --> 03:00:39.680 align:start position:0%

out ours so
 
03:00:48.830 --> 03:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
um we're going to do some discussion of
 
03:00:52.070 --> 03:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
that which I think is going to include
 
03:00:54.469 --> 03:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
all of your sections and you start on
 
03:00:58.229 --> 03:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
page 280 with Section
 
03:01:02.030 --> 03:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
327 and Mr Kane how far does that go
 
03:01:06.190 --> 03:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
sure so I believe this goes from section
 
03:01:09.630 --> 03:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
326 on page uh
 
03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:12.640 align:start position:0%

explain section 333 hous had no such
 
03:02:59.710 --> 03:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
section sure section 333 through 354
 
03:03:02.349 --> 03:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
which begins on page 284 is relative to
 
03:03:05.710 --> 03:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
the um state employee pay rise which was
 
03:03:07.830 --> 03:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh ratified by the various barting
 
03:03:11.950 --> 03:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:15.190 --> 03:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
finished so the house will exceed to
 
03:03:18.389 --> 03:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
that and that brings us to
 
03:03:18.399 --> 03:03:20.389 align:start position:0%
that and that brings us to
page

03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:03:20.399 --> 03:03:23.510 align:start position:0%
page
292

03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:26.349 --> 03:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
correct we did not have this comparable
 
03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
section is
 
03:03:31.429 --> 03:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
355 did that come out of the new labor
 
03:03:33.590 --> 03:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
contract this was actually I believe
 
03:03:35.429 --> 03:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenal offered this amendment
 
03:03:37.790 --> 03:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
but it's in addition of a boiler plate
 
03:03:39.510 --> 03:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
section that had been in there relative
 
03:03:42.229 --> 03:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
to how any positions if there were
 
03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
layoffs uh which which aren't contained
 
03:03:45.710 --> 03:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
in this budget but there is a certain
 
03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
process uh that they have to follow so
 
03:03:49.910 --> 03:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is something that typically is
 
03:03:51.550 --> 03:03:51.560 align:start position:0%
included in house bill to that was not
 
03:03:54.269 --> 03:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
included yet would you like to speak to
 
03:03:55.750 --> 03:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
your section Senator
 
03:03:58.590 --> 03:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
rosenal and please pull the mic close
 
03:04:00.349 --> 03:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
people you have a soft voice and people
 
03:04:12.389 --> 03:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:12.399 --> 03:04:14.790 align:start position:0%
 
problem

03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:04:17.150 --> 03:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
the house will exceed to this
 
03:04:20.510 --> 03:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
language we would like to hold on the
 
03:04:23.070 --> 03:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
section beginning
 
03:04:27.750 --> 03:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
356 and how far does this section go Mr
 
03:04:30.630 --> 03:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
Kaine this's go several Pages several
 
03:04:34.670 --> 03:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
sections uh 356 through 361 begins on
 
03:04:37.750 --> 03:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
page 292 and ends on page
 
03:04:41.590 --> 03:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
306 okay we're going to hold
 
03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:53.550 --> 03:04:53.560 align:start position:0%
ctions that brings us to 362 on page 306
 
03:04:55.750 --> 03:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Kane can you walk us through this
 
03:04:58.550 --> 03:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
please sure this is a section that the
 
03:05:00.229 --> 03:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
03:05:02.950 --> 03:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
had approached the Senate relative to uh
 
03:05:05.630 --> 03:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
annual and sickly for unclassified
 
03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
executive PL employees um I think this
 
03:05:10.550 --> 03:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
is something that the department polies
 
03:05:12.229 --> 03:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
will help them recruit and fill the
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
unclassified position
 
03:05:16.830 --> 03:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh which allows the formerly classified
 
03:05:19.229 --> 03:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
employees to maintain any leave that
 
03:05:20.990 --> 03:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
they accumulated prior to transferring
 
03:05:23.389 --> 03:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
to that unclassified
 
03:05:27.229 --> 03:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
position as I understand the current
 
03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
law if you switch from classified
 
03:05:32.790 --> 03:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
unclassified you lose all your ACR sick
 
03:05:35.790 --> 03:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
time and vacation time they pay you for
 
03:05:37.910 --> 03:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
it but you no longer have in case you
 
03:05:39.550 --> 03:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
get the flu or something you no longer
 
03:05:41.750 --> 03:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
have any builtup time that you can stay
 
03:05:43.670 --> 03:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
home is that correct correct
 
03:05:46.469 --> 03:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
unclassified don't earn leave time so uh
 
03:05:48.309 --> 03:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
I believe you'll be paid if you left
 
03:05:50.070 --> 03:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
that position unless it's retirement you
 
03:05:52.190 --> 03:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
paid your annual and your comp time uh
 
03:05:55.269 --> 03:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
as well any bonus leave um this allows
 
03:05:57.190 --> 03:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
them to carry forward your annual comp
 
03:05:59.309 --> 03:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
and your sick to that unclassified
 
03:06:01.030 --> 03:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
position so that in the event you retire
 
03:06:02.830 --> 03:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
from that unclassified position when you
 
03:06:04.710 --> 03:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
retire you can be paid for that service
 
03:06:06.550 --> 03:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
and use
 
03:06:09.510 --> 03:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
that thoughts of the
 
03:06:12.190 --> 03:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
house the house will exceed to the
 
03:06:16.229 --> 03:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
Senate turning to page 307 we now are
 
03:06:20.030 --> 03:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
all in into sections that the house did
 
03:06:20.040 --> 03:06:22.710 align:start position:0%
all in into sections that the house did
not

03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:25.950 --> 03:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
have so
 
03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
307 does that go along with what we were
 
03:06:31.269 --> 03:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
just discussing Mr Kane it does sections
 
03:06:36.190 --> 03:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
362 through 365 which begins on page 306
 
03:06:39.269 --> 03:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
and goes through Page 307 um are all
 
03:06:41.030 --> 03:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
related to what we just discussed the
 
03:06:45.910 --> 03:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
next section uh would be relative to a
 
03:06:48.429 --> 03:06:48.439 align:start position:0%
366 which is a new section on the bottom
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
of page 308 that was added by the Senate
 
03:06:53.710 --> 03:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
relative to abolished positions uh which
 
03:06:57.269 --> 03:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
states that any position that was uh
 
03:07:00.150 --> 03:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
remained was vacant on July 1st 2018 and
 
03:07:01.990 --> 03:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
remains fake and shall be abolished by
 
03:07:04.469 --> 03:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
September 30th it does provide uh the
 
03:07:06.309 --> 03:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
governor to provide exceptions as
 
03:07:08.590 --> 03:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
necessary um and then a follow-up report
 
03:07:10.030 --> 03:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee on how many
 
03:07:11.510 --> 03:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
positions were
 
03:07:14.469 --> 03:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
impacted so if you're position was
 
03:07:17.429 --> 03:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
vacant prior to July 1st
 
03:07:20.950 --> 03:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
201118 2018 and three years later it's
 
03:07:24.469 --> 03:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
still vacant it's gone the money's gone
 
03:07:26.950 --> 03:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
budgets are reduced cor correct the
 
03:07:29.670 --> 03:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
house exceeds to this language do did
 
03:07:31.429 --> 03:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
you say we have a preliminary on how
 
03:07:34.630 --> 03:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
affect uh Senator Daniels may have the
 
03:07:37.560 --> 03:07:39.550 align:start position:0%
affect uh Senator Daniels may have the
number

03:07:39.550 --> 03:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:07:43.510 --> 03:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
um hundreds of positions um I believe
 
03:07:45.150 --> 03:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
this could impact it could be several
 
03:07:46.870 --> 03:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars potentially not
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily General funds these are
 
03:07:52.429 --> 03:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:56.590 --> 03:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
Etc section 367 which is on page
 
03:08:00.110 --> 03:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
309 is a section that the agricultural
 
03:08:02.790 --> 03:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
commi commissioner mentioned to us when
 
03:08:05.950 --> 03:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
he met with us in division one however
 
03:08:08.469 --> 03:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any money so we didn't go
 
03:08:11.150 --> 03:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
ahead with it this now appropriates the
 
03:08:12.030 --> 03:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
sum of
 
03:08:15.309 --> 03:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to the cost of care fund for
 
03:08:17.349 --> 03:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture markets
 
03:08:17.359 --> 03:08:19.110 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture markets

03:08:22.710 --> 03:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
food and we will exed to the governor to
 
03:08:24.790 --> 03:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
the H Senate on this and it goes along
 
03:08:28.630 --> 03:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:28.640 --> 03:08:30.190 align:start position:0%
 
368

03:08:30.190 --> 03:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
368
 
03:08:33.150 --> 03:08:33.160 align:start position:0%
369 this is the new data manager
 
03:08:35.950 --> 03:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
position is this the position Mr Kain
 
03:08:39.030 --> 03:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
that after the federal government sent
 
03:08:41.269 --> 03:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
written notice to the Commissioner of
 
03:08:43.550 --> 03:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
Agriculture that they would no longer do
 
03:08:46.429 --> 03:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
the data in entry he had to have this
 
03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
position that is correct relative to the
 
03:08:52.309 --> 03:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
dairy program and the house will exceed
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
to the Senate on that page and that
 
03:08:57.710 --> 03:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
section and if there's
 
03:09:01.269 --> 03:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
a continuation no that ends it all right
 
03:09:03.469 --> 03:09:03.479 align:start position:0%
we get to page
 
03:09:07.389 --> 03:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
310 section 370 another new section can
 
03:09:09.550 --> 03:09:09.560 align:start position:0%

National Guard enlistment incentive uh
 
03:10:40.990 --> 03:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
you will see if I stay on page
 
03:10:44.670 --> 03:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
312 uh you will see the bottom or at the
 
03:10:47.229 --> 03:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
in the top block that the fines um
 
03:10:49.309 --> 03:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
relative to the state treasur credited
 
03:10:50.550 --> 03:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire National Guard
 
03:10:52.229 --> 03:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention scholarship
 
03:10:56.389 --> 03:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
fund uh has been removed and I believe I
 
03:10:58.309 --> 03:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
don't believe that program was funded in
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:04.750 --> 03:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
Coffman that's correct the scholarship
 
03:11:07.269 --> 03:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
program had no appropriation in the
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
budget request and this program replaces
 
03:11:15.070 --> 03:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
the former uh National Guard scholarship
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
program so we're going to repeal the
 
03:11:20.429 --> 03:11:20.439 align:start position:0%
scholarship program and replace it for
 
03:11:22.030 --> 03:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
the same amount with an incentive
 
03:11:24.750 --> 03:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
program to try to incent people and they
 
03:11:27.229 --> 03:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
had been dis they had discovered because
 
03:11:29.150 --> 03:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
they do get free tuition at the
 
03:11:31.229 --> 03:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
University and the community colleges
 
03:11:34.070 --> 03:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
that they didn't need the scholarship
 
03:11:36.590 --> 03:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
program so the house will exceed to
 
03:11:36.600 --> 03:11:41.750 align:start position:0%
program so the house will exceed to
those

03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:46.550 --> 03:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
sections uh Mr Kane we are on page 313
 
03:11:48.389 --> 03:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
so that will take you and we have to
 
03:11:51.190 --> 03:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
shift this and now we have some new
 
03:11:53.150 --> 03:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
sections from the insurance department
 
03:11:55.110 --> 03:11:55.120 align:start position:0%

03:11:58.750 --> 03:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
see yes they did um establish um some
 
03:12:01.110 --> 03:12:01.120 align:start position:0%

03:12:25.190 --> 03:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
that relate to this yes I'm sorry
 
03:12:28.070 --> 03:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
section 380 on page 314 also relates to
 
03:12:28.080 --> 03:12:29.670 align:start position:0%
section 380 on page 314 also relates to
section

03:12:29.670 --> 03:12:29.680 align:start position:0%

03:12:33.030 --> 03:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
379 okay the house will exceed to that
 
03:12:39.630 --> 03:12:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:44.429 --> 03:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
381 yep section 381 on page 314
 
03:12:49.349 --> 03:12:49.359 align:start position:0%

corporations and what does that mean
 
03:13:03.150 --> 03:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to the Senate on that
 
03:13:07.190 --> 03:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
sure uh thank you very much Madam chair
 
03:13:09.790 --> 03:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
this money is for the administrative
 
03:13:11.910 --> 03:13:11.920 align:start position:0%

03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:13.429 align:start position:0%

Corporation
 
03:13:16.870 --> 03:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:19.670 --> 03:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
rdc's operate both a loan and grant
 
03:13:21.950 --> 03:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
program or small
 
03:13:26.190 --> 03:13:26.200 align:start position:0%

woods um is one of the 10 rdc's
 
03:13:33.309 --> 03:13:33.319 align:start position:0%
so this was why the Senate chose to fund
 
03:13:36.750 --> 03:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
it okay house
 
03:13:39.630 --> 03:13:39.640 align:start position:0%
okay the house will exceed to the Senate
 
03:13:43.349 --> 03:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
language moving us quickly along to page
 
03:13:43.359 --> 03:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
language moving us quickly along to page
P

03:13:46.790 --> 03:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
3155 page 315 of section 382 this is a
 
03:13:54.630 --> 03:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
$25 million appropriation from fiscal
 
03:13:56.830 --> 03:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
year 21 to the Housing Finance
 
03:13:59.670 --> 03:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
authorities affordable housing
 
03:14:02.309 --> 03:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
fund I think
 
03:14:04.710 --> 03:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
many committees in both the house and
 
03:14:07.630 --> 03:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
the Senate hear from people on the lack
 
03:14:09.469 --> 03:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
of affordable housing and making
 
03:14:15.790 --> 03:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:18.229 --> 03:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
state is this
 
03:14:20.950 --> 03:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation to be spent in this fiscal
 
03:14:23.070 --> 03:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
year or this fiscal
 
03:14:25.910 --> 03:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
bium this would be non-aps so based on
 
03:14:27.269 --> 03:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
the timing of the passage of the budget
 
03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
would be for future years
 
03:14:32.750 --> 03:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay the house is going to exceed to the
 
03:14:37.349 --> 03:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:41.469 --> 03:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
383 we have a new section from
 
03:14:41.479 --> 03:14:44.750 align:start position:0%
383 we have a new section from
dnrc

03:14:44.750 --> 03:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:47.429 --> 03:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
384 Mr Kane give us the background on
 
03:14:49.990 --> 03:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
this sure section 384 was added by an
 
03:14:51.990 --> 03:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
amendment from Senator Hennessy she was
 
03:14:55.309 --> 03:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
contract uh contacted by uh the Bureau
 
03:14:57.389 --> 03:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
of certain Trail organizations in her
 
03:15:00.110 --> 03:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
area uh this has to do there's no cost
 
03:15:02.150 --> 03:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
associated with this what it does is it
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
allows any grant and aid provided so
 
03:15:07.070 --> 03:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
basically snowmobile or ohrv fees that
 
03:15:08.550 --> 03:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
are given to these
 
03:15:11.349 --> 03:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
organizations um it caps what they can
 
03:15:13.830 --> 03:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
be used for it moves that cap from in
 
03:15:17.309 --> 03:15:17.319 align:start position:0%
some instances 60 to 70% up to 90% And
 
03:15:19.870 --> 03:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
so it it's no additional funds it's just
 
03:15:22.630 --> 03:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
how the funds uh may be used and granted
 
03:15:25.229 --> 03:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:28.229 --> 03:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
organizations represent
 
03:15:33.189 --> 03:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
vber thank you um Mr Kane the the way
 
03:15:36.790 --> 03:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's written it says it's only for ohrv
 
03:15:43.590 --> 03:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
Trails is that a a mistake or are we
 
03:15:47.269 --> 03:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
because there are snowmobile trails that
 
03:15:52.590 --> 03:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
do not follow o ohrv rules so I'm I'm a
 
03:15:56.710 --> 03:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
little concerned that uh if it's only
 
03:16:01.429 --> 03:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
ohrv that's one thing but if it's both
 
03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
then obviously I like
 
03:16:06.590 --> 03:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
it better than you like it
 
03:16:10.590 --> 03:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
now yeah I would have to say it's not Mr
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
Kane what is your thought sure we can um
 
03:16:18.150 --> 03:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
talk to Senator Hennessy to uh just
 
03:16:20.389 --> 03:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
ensure that that was not a mistake that
 
03:16:22.590 --> 03:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
was intentional and and I I'll have to
 
03:16:25.030 --> 03:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
do a stat story search relative to the
 
03:16:28.349 --> 03:16:28.359 align:start position:0%
definition of ohrv Trails um or mik
 
03:16:31.229 --> 03:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
coffin might be able to add something
 
03:16:34.269 --> 03:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
think yes this amendment was intended to
 
03:16:36.229 --> 03:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
be specific to
 
03:16:41.389 --> 03:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
hrvs and not snow not both just the hrvs
 
03:16:44.990 --> 03:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
I do not know why but I do know
 
03:16:48.990 --> 03:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
initially it was drafted with both and
 
03:16:52.110 --> 03:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
then it was changed to be only applying
 
03:16:52.120 --> 03:16:55.110 align:start position:0%
then it was changed to be only applying
to

03:16:55.110 --> 03:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:57.590 --> 03:16:57.600 align:start position:0%

create this master fund um and it's
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
probably the least request that Senator
 
03:19:05.389 --> 03:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
Senator Styles has ever asked for that's
 
03:19:09.469 --> 03:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
for sure Hampton and um the uh we said
 
03:19:12.429 --> 03:19:12.439 align:start position:0%
we'd agree to it in the Senate house are
 
03:19:16.710 --> 03:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
we okay I'm okay yeah we will exceed to
 
03:19:20.950 --> 03:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
this all right Mike we're dipping right
 
03:19:23.910 --> 03:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
along yes section three that brings you
 
03:19:26.830 --> 03:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
to section 387 on page 316 actually
 
03:19:29.630 --> 03:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
sections 387 and 388 this is relative to
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
an appropriation of approximately $3
 
03:19:36.150 --> 03:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
million uh for the soal granite Shield
 
03:19:38.429 --> 03:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
program I have an amendment on that
 
03:19:40.550 --> 03:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
someplace yes you do we can hand that
 
03:20:02.550 --> 03:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:04.349 --> 03:20:04.359 align:start position:0%
I don't even I don't even have to read
 
03:20:10.510 --> 03:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:20.110 --> 03:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:24.830 --> 03:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
M okay basically what this does is it
 
03:20:28.950 --> 03:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:32.870 --> 03:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
into the section that's added on page
 
03:20:37.750 --> 03:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
two Granite Shield is used to help law
 
03:20:40.670 --> 03:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement cut down on drugs in our
 
03:20:43.870 --> 03:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
state and the legislature believes it
 
03:20:47.349 --> 03:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
should cover the entire program because
 
03:20:50.510 --> 03:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
once the arrest is made many of those
 
03:20:54.150 --> 03:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
people use public defenders that money
 
03:20:56.510 --> 03:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
is paid out of the judicial
 
03:20:59.950 --> 03:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
Council and we have in the past if you
 
03:21:02.590 --> 03:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
brought in a grant that wasn't in the
 
03:21:06.429 --> 03:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
budget provided 5% of the grant to go to
 
03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
public defenders so that judicial
 
03:21:10.750 --> 03:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
Council would not have to come back to
 
03:21:13.229 --> 03:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal and say well you didn't fund me
 
03:21:17.910 --> 03:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
again so this section two makes it clear
 
03:21:19.950 --> 03:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
that for granite
 
03:21:23.910 --> 03:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
Shield 5% of any additional funds not
 
03:21:26.990 --> 03:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
just federal grants will go to the
 
03:21:31.150 --> 03:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
public defender so that there is defense
 
03:21:35.870 --> 03:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:38.830 --> 03:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
red Senator Bradley yes uh thank you
 
03:21:41.150 --> 03:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
very much so if I'm understanding this
 
03:21:44.229 --> 03:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
amendment correct irly uh this would not
 
03:21:46.550 --> 03:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
subtract anything from the initial I
 
03:21:49.189 --> 03:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
think it's $3 million Grant but it would
 
03:21:51.229 --> 03:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
be any additional funds over and above
 
03:21:52.910 --> 03:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
that that would go toward the public
 
03:21:55.790 --> 03:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
defender is that correct I'm going Mr
 
03:21:58.110 --> 03:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
landang kindly wrote this and I'm going
 
03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
to let him give you an answer that will
 
03:22:02.590 --> 03:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
be 100% correct instead of me just
 
03:22:04.910 --> 03:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
agreeing and turning out it
 
03:22:06.830 --> 03:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't I would say the way this is
 
03:22:09.389 --> 03:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
drafted the 5% would be from the the
 
03:22:12.189 --> 03:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation in section 387 if if the
 
03:22:14.309 --> 03:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
intent would be to have an additional
 
03:22:17.469 --> 03:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
it's approximately $150,000 is the 5% is
 
03:22:19.630 --> 03:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
what that represents that would be above
 
03:22:22.590 --> 03:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
and beyond the three million already in
 
03:22:23.670 --> 03:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh house bill
 
03:22:26.110 --> 03:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
to I'm okay with that if you guys are
 
03:22:29.670 --> 03:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
okay with that Senator rosenal I have a
 
03:22:32.990 --> 03:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
question um about the insert
 
03:22:35.630 --> 03:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
language does this mean that if the
 
03:22:39.510 --> 03:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
judicial Council came to fiscal and said
 
03:22:43.189 --> 03:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
we need another $100,000 of General
 
03:22:46.710 --> 03:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
funds to pay for Indigent defense if we
 
03:22:50.189 --> 03:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
gave it to them they'd be putting
 
03:22:52.189 --> 03:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
$5,000 into
 
03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
that fund so we would be
 
03:23:00.110 --> 03:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
transferring General funds from just one
 
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
place to another to the best of my lot
 
03:23:05.150 --> 03:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge judicial Council does not have
 
03:23:07.670 --> 03:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds so it goes into their
 
03:23:10.150 --> 03:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
budget line items for General
 
03:23:12.910 --> 03:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
funds yes so in this instance what would
 
03:23:16.070 --> 03:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
happen Senator is um of the just assumed
 
03:23:18.269 --> 03:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
3 million the 5% is deducted from this
 
03:23:20.950 --> 03:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
new $3 million uh that would provide an
 
03:23:20.960 --> 03:23:21.910 align:start position:0%
new $3 million uh that would provide an
additional

03:23:21.910 --> 03:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
additional
 
03:23:24.389 --> 03:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
$150,000 to the judicial Council over
 
03:23:26.229 --> 03:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
and above what's budgeted in house bill
 
03:23:29.110 --> 03:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
one so it should uh alleviate the need
 
03:23:32.030 --> 03:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
for them to come to fiscal for that 150
 
03:23:32.040 --> 03:23:34.710 align:start position:0%
for them to come to fiscal for that 150
thank

03:23:34.710 --> 03:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:38.070 --> 03:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
you so Madam chair I would move to
 
03:23:40.389 --> 03:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
accept your Amendment with a additional
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
amendment to ensure that these are
 
03:23:45.790 --> 03:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
additional funds not from the existing
 
03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
Granite Shield grant that would be fine
 
03:23:49.630 --> 03:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
with me Mr landan can we make that
 
03:23:51.469 --> 03:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
happen without waiting for paperwork yep
 
03:23:55.070 --> 03:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
we can do that okay is there a second
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
second if the house is in favor please
 
03:23:59.510 --> 03:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
raise your
 
03:24:03.189 --> 03:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
hands we are unanimous Senator
 
03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
mois Senate is
 
03:24:08.150 --> 03:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
unanimous and with that
 
03:24:12.630 --> 03:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
addition we accept um
 
03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
lines sorry sections 387 and 388 and it
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
brings us to section 389 the fire
 
03:24:23.269 --> 03:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
standards and training and Emergency
 
03:24:25.710 --> 03:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
Medical Services fund correct which
 
03:24:29.030 --> 03:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
continues on page
 
03:24:33.389 --> 03:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
317 yes section 389 uh goes along with
 
03:24:36.590 --> 03:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
390 and to summarize those two actions
 
03:24:38.710 --> 03:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
the first section
 
03:24:41.590 --> 03:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
389 appropriates an additional 30
 
03:24:44.870 --> 03:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
$100,000 a fiscal year into the fire
 
03:24:46.910 --> 03:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
standards and training and EMS fund from
 
03:24:48.389 --> 03:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
the general fund so that's a general
 
03:24:50.550 --> 03:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
fund cost that's uh reflected in the
 
03:24:53.670 --> 03:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
Senate Surplus statement section 390 as
 
03:24:55.630 --> 03:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
a result of those additions additional
 
03:24:57.030 --> 03:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
funds section
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
390 appropriates $200,000 from the fire
 
03:25:02.950 --> 03:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
fund which has now just been um received
 
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
that additional 300 and that is
 
03:25:07.469 --> 03:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
specifically for the purpose of funding
 
03:25:09.950 --> 03:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
additional part-time instruction uh and
 
03:25:12.750 --> 03:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
providing discounts to the those uh send
 
03:25:14.950 --> 03:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
those fire um departments that are
 
03:25:18.710 --> 03:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
sending uh trainees here so this avoided
 
03:25:20.590 --> 03:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
a need for uh tuition
 
03:25:22.750 --> 03:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
increase representative bumberger this
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
is your team I understand you are in
 
03:25:27.189 --> 03:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
agreement with this
 
03:25:29.469 --> 03:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely the house will exceed to the
 
03:25:32.790 --> 03:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
language in these two sections which
 
03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
brings us Mr Kane to section 391 I sense
 
03:25:38.189 --> 03:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
another yippe coming out of
 
03:25:38.199 --> 03:25:39.750 align:start position:0%
another yippe coming out of
Representative

03:25:39.750 --> 03:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
03:25:44.349 --> 03:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
hurger sure section 391 is a a general
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
fund transfer to the highway fund of $50
 
03:25:50.070 --> 03:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal year 22 as Senator
 
03:25:52.309 --> 03:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
Moore stated uh the Senate Revenue
 
03:25:54.189 --> 03:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
estimates were higher due to collections
 
03:25:56.110 --> 03:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
in April and projected collections in
 
03:25:58.510 --> 03:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
May and June uh that left a significant
 
03:26:00.349 --> 03:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
sum in the general fund at the end of 22
 
03:26:02.030 --> 03:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
which the Senate decided to transfer to
 
03:26:04.189 --> 03:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
the highway fund um since the highway
 
03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
fund ending balance was under a million
 
03:26:09.229 --> 03:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
dollars um projected at the end of 23
 
03:26:12.110 --> 03:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
this Shores up the highway fund Senator
 
03:26:15.309 --> 03:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
Morris yeah the um it's probably worth
 
03:26:17.229 --> 03:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
making the point here because I I read
 
03:26:19.550 --> 03:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
an article about how much money the
 
03:26:20.950 --> 03:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
senate had in
 
03:26:24.309 --> 03:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
21 um there's $50 million to put into
 
03:26:26.590 --> 03:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
the highway fund here the next line that
 
03:26:28.229 --> 03:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to read about is 7 million
 
03:26:30.070 --> 03:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
we put into the highway fund which will
 
03:26:33.510 --> 03:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
free up an additional in total 29
 
03:26:36.269 --> 03:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
million um in the highway fund when they
 
03:26:39.790 --> 03:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
work with Washington on that line um
 
03:26:42.590 --> 03:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
along with that um um it was mentioned
 
03:26:44.030 --> 03:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
earlier that there's money in the
 
03:26:46.229 --> 03:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
education trust fund it's about 24
 
03:26:48.870 --> 03:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
million until we pass something that
 
03:26:52.110 --> 03:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
Lottery asked us to do um and there's
 
03:26:56.030 --> 03:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
155 million plus um because I do believe
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
revenues are going up going to be in the
 
03:27:00.189 --> 03:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund so when people are
 
03:27:02.950 --> 03:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
looking for where hundreds of millions
 
03:27:06.670 --> 03:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
of dollars ended up um I wouldn't just
 
03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
look to the spend lines we the Senate
 
03:27:11.630 --> 03:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time trying to fill
 
03:27:13.950 --> 03:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
buckets um that will protect money for
 
03:27:13.960 --> 03:27:14.830 align:start position:0%
buckets um that will protect money for
the

03:27:14.830 --> 03:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
future this is one of them and uh I
 
03:27:21.269 --> 03:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
think everybody knows I have
 
03:27:23.229 --> 03:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
F we do
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
this and this um I'll add to that with
 
03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
every car getting seems like better
 
03:27:32.750 --> 03:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
mileage every year hybrid cars all
 
03:27:35.349 --> 03:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
electric cars we're not getting the gas
 
03:27:37.630 --> 03:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
tax we used to get which was what filled
 
03:27:40.389 --> 03:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
the highway fund and then last year we
 
03:27:42.670 --> 03:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
had people who just didn't commute we
 
03:27:45.510 --> 03:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
all stayed home not just in this state
 
03:27:47.469 --> 03:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
but in other state we used to have a lot
 
03:27:49.550 --> 03:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
of people ride from here to
 
03:27:51.710 --> 03:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and back and forth and
 
03:27:53.309 --> 03:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
that was big income for the highway
 
03:27:55.750 --> 03:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
funding that was entirely
 
03:27:58.630 --> 03:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
gone Senator Mor I would just suggest I
 
03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
made this clear earlier um that
 
03:28:05.030 --> 03:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative major send his program to
 
03:28:07.630 --> 03:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
the federal government because they're
 
03:28:10.309 --> 03:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
contemplating fixing that electric car
 
03:28:12.389 --> 03:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
situation and representative Maes
 
03:28:15.510 --> 03:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
program I think would work nationally so
 
03:28:17.670 --> 03:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
if he would have send it there um
 
03:28:19.229 --> 03:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
they're looking for a funding source
 
03:28:21.830 --> 03:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
right now so um I'm sure you could send
 
03:28:24.309 --> 03:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
it to the US senators and it probably
 
03:28:26.910 --> 03:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
would work to solve the problem they're
 
03:28:30.030 --> 03:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
trying to Sol yep represent major for
 
03:28:31.830 --> 03:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
those of you who don't know has spent
 
03:28:36.550 --> 03:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
hours trying to work out how to make
 
03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
Road repairs and Bridge repairs
 
03:28:41.189 --> 03:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
Equitable as we go to hybrid intellect
 
03:28:43.910 --> 03:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles so he's to be
 
03:28:46.670 --> 03:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
commended for that the house will exceed
 
03:28:50.550 --> 03:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
to section 391 in section 392 by with
 
03:28:53.389 --> 03:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
the $7 million we actually free up I
 
03:28:56.189 --> 03:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
think it's 29 million in the highway
 
03:28:58.349 --> 03:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
fund because this is something that the
 
03:29:01.510 --> 03:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
state owes the federal government gets
 
03:29:04.750 --> 03:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
it off the books reduces State liability
 
03:29:07.030 --> 03:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
so it just improves our bond rating and
 
03:29:09.349 --> 03:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to do that and we are
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
exceeding to that as well as section
 
03:29:15.229 --> 03:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
393 Madam chair this
 
03:29:17.429 --> 03:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
actually well we've all been working on
 
03:29:19.349 --> 03:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
another committee with federal funds and
 
03:29:20.710 --> 03:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
everything this was something we
 
03:29:24.110 --> 03:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
researched um this actually sends 29
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
million back to New Hampshire after we
 
03:29:29.070 --> 03:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
pay off Our obligation oh excellent so
 
03:29:31.550 --> 03:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
we get 29 million more for paying off
 
03:29:34.150 --> 03:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
the obligation that's even
 
03:29:37.950 --> 03:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
better oh Mike 394 we're going to remove
 
03:29:41.950 --> 03:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
toll booth sure section 394 and 39 4A
 
03:29:47.910 --> 03:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
would remove um the exit 10 uh toll from
 
03:29:50.229 --> 03:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
the Fe return Pike in the town of
 
03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
marac and we'd already voted that no
 
03:29:55.469 --> 03:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
tolls would be correct collected there
 
03:29:57.670 --> 03:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
so the house will exceed to both of
 
03:29:57.680 --> 03:29:58.750 align:start position:0%
so the house will exceed to both of
those

03:29:58.750 --> 03:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:30:02.469 --> 03:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
sections can you brief us on
 
03:30:05.550 --> 03:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
395 sure section
 
03:30:10.110 --> 03:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
395 is a an appropriation of $3.25
 
03:30:12.309 --> 03:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
million in school year 22 for the
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
purpose of funding a reconstruction and
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
reclassification project of a 2-mile
 
03:30:21.189 --> 03:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
road uh caleff Hill Road in the town of
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
Tilton is this the road that the
 
03:30:26.510 --> 03:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
Veteran's Home is on I believe it's an
 
03:30:28.269 --> 03:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
access to the veterans home it's one of
 
03:30:29.469 --> 03:30:29.479 align:start position:0%
the roads that you can access the
 
03:30:33.030 --> 03:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:38.030 --> 03:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
from the house will exceed to this
 
03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
section that brings us down to 397
 
03:30:42.840 --> 03:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
section that brings us down to 397
section

03:30:44.070 --> 03:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:30:47.110 --> 03:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
396 is a general fund appropriation of
 
03:30:50.790 --> 03:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
$5 million in fiscal year 22 and the
 
03:30:52.990 --> 03:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of this appropriation as well as
 
03:30:55.389 --> 03:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
an appropriation contained for the uh
 
03:30:59.349 --> 03:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
Port Authority of 4 million in 25 allows
 
03:31:02.070 --> 03:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
the state to access 20 plus million of
 
03:31:04.590 --> 03:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds which they were um able to
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
leverage with Appropriations but could
 
03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
not use Turnpike toll credits which is
 
03:31:10.229 --> 03:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
the typical match uh so this would bring
 
03:31:13.269 --> 03:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
in the 5 million plus the 4,25 would
 
03:31:15.750 --> 03:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
bring in I think in over $25 million of
 
03:31:18.630 --> 03:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds okay so this
 
03:31:22.110 --> 03:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
cash match gets us more than $25 million
 
03:31:26.110 --> 03:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
into the state we will exceed to section
 
03:31:30.070 --> 03:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
396 and that brings us to 397 which
 
03:31:35.349 --> 03:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
319 yes section
 
03:31:43.189 --> 03:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
397 on 318 and uh 398 is relative to an
 
03:31:45.630 --> 03:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation that was provided uh to
 
03:31:49.189 --> 03:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
HHS previous banum for child welfare uh
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
this allows the that appropriation not
 
03:31:55.510 --> 03:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
to lapse until the end of fiscal year 22
 
03:31:57.510 --> 03:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
so no additional money would allow the
 
03:31:59.070 --> 03:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
money to not lapse and that would be
 
03:32:01.150 --> 03:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
available until the end of 22 so we're
 
03:32:03.590 --> 03:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
extending the end date that's correct
 
03:32:05.710 --> 03:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
puron of Edwards were yeah the house
 
03:32:08.590 --> 03:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
will exceed to 397
 
03:32:13.670 --> 03:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:20.550 --> 03:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:24.990 --> 03:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
Kane sure I may turn to
 
03:32:27.630 --> 03:32:27.640 align:start position:0%
um Kevin Ripple I believe this was a
 
03:32:30.590 --> 03:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
change requested by the office of child
 
03:32:33.030 --> 03:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
advocate if I'm not mistaken Kevin do
 
03:32:36.030 --> 03:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
you have any background on that sure uh
 
03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
sections 399 through 402 actually
 
03:32:42.030 --> 03:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
incorporate aort portion of Senate Bill
 
03:32:44.830 --> 03:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
157 uh and they just change reporting
 
03:32:47.229 --> 03:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
requirements for the system of care for
 
03:32:48.830 --> 03:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health so all you
 
03:32:50.590 --> 03:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
see here are some new requirements being
 
03:32:53.389 --> 03:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
added and some statutory references
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
being changed to reflect the new
 
03:32:57.670 --> 03:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
requirements what happened to Senate
 
03:32:57.680 --> 03:33:00.030 align:start position:0%
requirements what happened to Senate
Bill

03:33:00.030 --> 03:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:02.910 --> 03:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
157 uh the Senate laid it on the table
 
03:33:04.429 --> 03:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
obviously for the purpose of putting it
 
03:33:08.950 --> 03:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
in the budget thank you and what this is
 
03:33:12.229 --> 03:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
um it's to implement sen a bill 4 which
 
03:33:15.189 --> 03:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
was the child system of care which I
 
03:33:16.630 --> 03:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
think we've all seen what's happened
 
03:33:21.790 --> 03:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
during Co to kids and mental health um I
 
03:33:24.670 --> 03:33:24.680 align:start position:0%
think the department was in the process
 
03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
before um Co struck of starting to stand
 
03:33:32.229 --> 03:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
up the program um obviously it got
 
03:33:34.710 --> 03:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
interrupted um protecting this lapse
 
03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
make sure it
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
does in the end get
 
03:33:39.760 --> 03:33:44.309 align:start position:0%
does in the end get
implemented

03:33:44.309 --> 03:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:46.269 --> 03:33:46.279 align:start position:0%

03:35:15.950 --> 03:35:15.960 align:start position:0%

03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh7 is relative to the supplemental
 
03:35:21.429 --> 03:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
nutritional assist nutrition assistance

program uh the snap incentive program it
 
03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
is a $150,000 appropriation for the next
 
03:35:30.070 --> 03:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
B Anum for the purpose of uh snap I
 
03:35:32.070 --> 03:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
believe this has to do with uh fresh
 
03:35:34.510 --> 03:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
fruits and vegetables at farmstands this
 
03:35:36.510 --> 03:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
is a bill that the house also has I
 
03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
believe we had a public hearing and we
 
03:35:40.990 --> 03:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
have it retained what is your pleasure
 
03:35:43.150 --> 03:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
now representative Edwards I'd like toed
 
03:35:45.429 --> 03:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
and thank Senator Hennessy for picking
 
03:35:48.830 --> 03:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
this up okay the house will exceed to
 
03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
405 and
 
03:35:56.429 --> 03:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
406 which relates and 407 which
 
03:36:05.269 --> 03:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
323 sure page 323 at the top of 323
 
03:36:12.870 --> 03:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
Senate section 40 8 this is an extension
 
03:36:15.150 --> 03:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
of I believe it's pres of Eligibility
 
03:36:16.670 --> 03:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
under the Medicaid Program through the
 
03:36:19.830 --> 03:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
end of the bium um that was requested by
 
03:36:19.840 --> 03:36:22.510 align:start position:0%
end of the bium um that was requested by
the

03:36:22.510 --> 03:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:25.030 --> 03:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
department actually could I just sure
 
03:36:27.710 --> 03:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
Kevin can clarify this one actually
 
03:36:31.389 --> 03:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
relates to um access to the state's
 
03:36:35.189 --> 03:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health System back in
 
03:36:37.990 --> 03:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
2011 there was language put in statute
 
03:36:39.790 --> 03:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh for budgetary reasons saying that
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
access would be limited to available
 
03:36:44.269 --> 03:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
Appropriations but the language that
 
03:36:45.790 --> 03:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
passed also included a prospective
 
03:36:48.790 --> 03:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
repeal so originally two years later uh
 
03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
that language was to be repealed and
 
03:36:52.750 --> 03:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
access would once again be unrestricted
 
03:36:55.950 --> 03:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
for budgetary reasons every two years
 
03:36:58.910 --> 03:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
the state has extended the repeal date
 
03:37:02.269 --> 03:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
so by not including this language the
 
03:37:04.429 --> 03:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
house would
 
03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
have allowed the repeal to go into
 
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
effect and the Senate once again extends
 
03:37:12.070 --> 03:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
it for another two years
 
03:37:12.080 --> 03:37:13.070 align:start position:0%
it for another two years
representative

Edwards uh we discussed this in division
 
03:37:18.110 --> 03:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
three and we thought that uh all good
 
03:37:20.349 --> 03:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
things must come to an end and we were
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
willing to let this end the Senate has
 
03:37:31.469 --> 03:37:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:35.790 --> 03:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
hold Mr Kane section 409 section 409 is
 
03:37:37.550 --> 03:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
relative to cost of living adjustments
 
03:37:39.189 --> 03:37:39.199 align:start position:0%

on that one
 
03:37:50.070 --> 03:37:50.080 align:start position:0%

to implement the cost of living
 
03:37:54.070 --> 03:37:54.080 align:start position:0%

03:38:37.229 --> 03:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
please section 411 I think I'll turn to
 
03:38:39.550 --> 03:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
Kevin it establishes a committee uh
 
03:38:41.870 --> 03:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
relative to Social Security uh waiver
 
03:38:43.990 --> 03:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
programs but um can you add anything
 
03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
Kevin I don't have any more information
 
03:38:48.590 --> 03:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
it would study uh wage parody among
 
03:38:54.349 --> 03:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:57.309 --> 03:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
groups I I don't remember any discussion
 
03:39:00.070 --> 03:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
on this so I I'd like to hold
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
please this is Senator Rosen yes this is
 
03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
um something that Senator GAA and I
 
03:39:13.590 --> 03:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
worked on during committee with the
 
03:39:17.189 --> 03:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
organizations that provide services to a
 
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
variety of Medicade waiver programs that
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
have different reimbursement
 
03:39:27.349 --> 03:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
rates and sometimes they're providing
 
03:39:30.870 --> 03:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
the same service but getting paid
 
03:39:34.790 --> 03:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
differently because of who
 
03:39:38.349 --> 03:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
the what division they're in of the
 
03:39:41.510 --> 03:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
department and it would just establish a
 
03:39:44.750 --> 03:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee to look at what rate parity
 
03:39:47.630 --> 03:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
for the same Services would look
 
03:39:50.429 --> 03:39:50.439 align:start position:0%
like so if I may we're not spending any
 
03:39:51.910 --> 03:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
money here we're just studying it and
 
03:39:53.630 --> 03:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
coming back with recommendations if
 
03:39:55.710 --> 03:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
that's the case I'm fine I'm fine with
 
03:39:57.910 --> 03:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you okay the house will
 
03:40:00.910 --> 03:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
exceed on Section
 
03:40:00.920 --> 03:40:03.189 align:start position:0%
exceed on Section
411

03:40:03.189 --> 03:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
411
 
03:40:06.790 --> 03:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
412 transitional housing bids sections
 
03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
412 and 413 which begins on page 3 24
 
03:40:14.750 --> 03:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate $6 million in 21 for the
 
03:40:16.670 --> 03:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of funding new transitional
 
03:40:18.830 --> 03:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
housing beds uh for patients with
 
03:40:20.830 --> 03:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
complex behavioral health conditions in
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
addition any unspent funds from previous
 
03:40:24.670 --> 03:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so the previous buum
 
03:40:26.469 --> 03:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
which I think can amount to up to $2
 
03:40:29.469 --> 03:40:29.479 align:start position:0%
million will also be available for the
 
03:40:31.790 --> 03:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
Department May the house will exceed on
 
03:40:33.229 --> 03:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
those two
 
03:40:38.229 --> 03:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
sections 414 please sections 414 and
 
03:40:41.229 --> 03:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
4115 are the necessary sections to
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
effectuate the uh non-aps of State loan
 
03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
repayment program funds in 21 in order
 
03:40:51.269 --> 03:40:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so okay we will exceed to
 
03:40:55.309 --> 03:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
414 and
 
03:41:01.870 --> 03:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
4:15 uh okay 414 415 416 and 4177 on
 
03:41:05.870 --> 03:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
page 325 uh effectuates the changes u in
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
house bill one recommended and adopted
 
03:41:11.590 --> 03:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
by the uh CSC for Medicaid services so
 
03:41:14.349 --> 03:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
any unspent funds at the end of 21 shall
 
03:41:16.150 --> 03:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
be carried forward into 23 and be
 
03:41:18.510 --> 03:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
available for expenditure for Medicaid
 
03:41:20.229 --> 03:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
so this is consistent with the actions
 
03:41:22.070 --> 03:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
taken in the house bill one the house
 
03:41:25.269 --> 03:41:25.279 align:start position:0%
will exceed on those two
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
sections beginning at the bottom of 425
 
03:41:30.030 --> 03:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
moving to the top of
 
03:41:35.030 --> 03:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
426 is the forensic psychiatric hospital
 
03:41:37.790 --> 03:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
correct yeah is there a discussion from
 
03:41:42.469 --> 03:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:45.110 --> 03:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
Senor Rosen thank you thank you Madame
 
03:41:48.309 --> 03:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
chair um this is something that got
 
03:41:52.870 --> 03:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
started in the current bium where uh we
 
03:41:55.750 --> 03:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
had appropriated a pretty significant
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
sum of money but it the project did not
 
03:42:02.030 --> 03:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
get started the result is it's going to
 
03:42:07.149 --> 03:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
cost 50% more money but also
 
03:42:11.389 --> 03:42:11.399 align:start position:0%
um think we should reflect on the fact
 
03:42:14.670 --> 03:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
that we're changing the policy here and
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
we will um if we adopt this provision
 
03:42:21.389 --> 03:42:21.399 align:start position:0%
that the Senate adopted we will be
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
allowing private prisons to operate the
 
03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
unit the house side representative
 
03:42:33.670 --> 03:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
Edwards do you have something to say I'm
 
03:42:35.269 --> 03:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing what Senator
 
03:42:37.389 --> 03:42:37.399 align:start position:0%
Bradley has to say I I I would just
 
03:42:39.670 --> 03:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
point out that uh when division three
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
heard heard about the heard this uh we
 
03:42:45.110 --> 03:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
decided it was a pretty big project and
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't have enough time to decide in
 
03:42:50.510 --> 03:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
our normal business so we held this
 
03:42:53.309 --> 03:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
issue over and met in a joint hearing
 
03:42:57.429 --> 03:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
with public works and HHS afterwards we
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
I think I think the as a result of that
 
03:43:02.590 --> 03:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
hearing we learned a lot and and I
 
03:43:04.630 --> 03:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
believe the department has made a lot of
 
03:43:09.309 --> 03:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
improvements to their plan but but I I I
 
03:43:11.590 --> 03:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
I we just missed it without prejudice
 
03:43:13.189 --> 03:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
hoping that the Senate could use our
 
03:43:15.229 --> 03:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
information so Senator Bradley and
 
03:43:17.030 --> 03:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Morris however you want to go
 
03:43:19.189 --> 03:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
please go well there's a there's a lot
 
03:43:19.199 --> 03:43:20.469 align:start position:0%
please go well there's a there's a lot
going

03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:43:24.269 --> 03:43:24.279 align:start position:0%
on if you press that down it stays on
 
03:43:26.590 --> 03:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
okay there's a lot going on here the
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
first of all we did have more money in
 
03:43:32.550 --> 03:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate so there was 8.7 million
 
03:43:34.870 --> 03:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the last budget so we
 
03:43:38.229 --> 03:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
chased down admin Services um to find
 
03:43:41.309 --> 03:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
out what work had been done done on this
 
03:43:43.389 --> 03:43:43.399 align:start position:0%
um because we got presented several
 
03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
numbers in the Senate one was the number
 
03:43:49.429 --> 03:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
to construct the project and two was a
 
03:43:51.710 --> 03:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
number to operate the project so as
 
03:43:51.720 --> 03:43:52.590 align:start position:0%
number to operate the project so as
Senator

03:43:52.590 --> 03:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
03:43:56.149 --> 03:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
rosenal um suggests about um whether
 
03:43:58.830 --> 03:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
private companies can operate or not
 
03:44:02.750 --> 03:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
operate the forensic hospital um no
 
03:44:05.790 --> 03:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
decisions have been made on this um
 
03:44:08.950 --> 03:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
actual construction isn't even going to
 
03:44:10.790 --> 03:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
get to that point till sometime next
 
03:44:14.469 --> 03:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
year that we can you know do this but
 
03:44:17.070 --> 03:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
reality is we were presented numbers
 
03:44:19.389 --> 03:44:19.399 align:start position:0%
that were a million dollars a person
 
03:44:21.429 --> 03:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
which did not seem right the Senate
 
03:44:25.710 --> 03:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
phase so um we basically said we believe
 
03:44:27.550 --> 03:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
we can come back the same thing we're
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
all doing um with the sununu Senate to
 
03:44:32.189 --> 03:44:32.199 align:start position:0%
be honest with you we don't believe
 
03:44:35.429 --> 03:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate what's being spent so
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
we do believe that we need to build this
 
03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
building because if you look at the
 
03:44:43.309 --> 03:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
people that are land some of the people
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
that are landing in um New Hampshire
 
03:44:48.630 --> 03:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
hospital they could be in this building
 
03:44:51.830 --> 03:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
um and we could Fe free up drf beds
 
03:44:54.269 --> 03:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
which throughout this whole session
 
03:44:57.070 --> 03:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
right now we're carrying numbers in drf
 
03:44:59.269 --> 03:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
beds that aren't acceptable for children
 
03:45:01.870 --> 03:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
or for adults so there's all kinds of
 
03:45:04.389 --> 03:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
solutions being worked on this is one
 
03:45:06.309 --> 03:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
solution that if it were built on the
 
03:45:08.910 --> 03:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
hospital grounds which is not the work
 
03:45:10.750 --> 03:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
they originally started out with they
 
03:45:13.269 --> 03:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
were going to do a freestanding unit um
 
03:45:15.990 --> 03:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
they think they can achieve you know
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
some ability to bring down the costs if
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
we do it on that property um and they
 
03:45:24.149 --> 03:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
asked us if we appropriate 30 million in
 
03:45:26.469 --> 03:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
the Senate don't put so many strings on
 
03:45:28.750 --> 03:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
us right now that we can't work to get
 
03:45:32.309 --> 03:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
this project done so we gave him some
 
03:45:35.309 --> 03:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
flexibility um we had the money from
 
03:45:38.149 --> 03:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
2021 that we believe could be freed up
 
03:45:39.429 --> 03:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
for this because you didn't have that
 
03:45:42.309 --> 03:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
choice choice in the house and we do
 
03:45:45.510 --> 03:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
believe it will help us with drf beds
 
03:45:47.269 --> 03:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
and in the long run we believe we can
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
make it affordable I I don't know what
 
03:45:51.510 --> 03:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
the solution is going to be on how to
 
03:45:54.149 --> 03:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
run it to be honest with you Senator
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
Bradley yeah and and let me just add to
 
03:45:59.070 --> 03:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
when we authorized in the last budget
 
03:46:02.070 --> 03:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
the $ 8.7 million there my understanding
 
03:46:03.910 --> 03:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
is there was a provisor in that budget
 
03:46:07.269 --> 03:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
that said it would not be run as a
 
03:46:11.189 --> 03:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
for-profit um prison that if I
 
03:46:13.070 --> 03:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly law still
 
03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
applies here so while that could change
 
03:46:20.149 --> 03:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
I suppose um my understanding is that it
 
03:46:25.510 --> 03:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:30.030 --> 03:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
operation Rosen Wald is well I think I
 
03:46:32.349 --> 03:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
could we ask the LBA because I think
 
03:46:35.349 --> 03:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
what we had been told was that this
 
03:46:38.309 --> 03:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
Senate's new language did make a change
 
03:46:41.750 --> 03:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
to what the
 
03:46:46.429 --> 03:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
operation of the spu could
 
03:46:48.750 --> 03:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
be I guess I'll just turn to K and see
 
03:46:49.910 --> 03:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
if he's heard anything from the
 
03:46:51.910 --> 03:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
Department on
 
03:46:54.389 --> 03:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
that operation as far as who could
 
03:46:55.990 --> 03:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
operate it the department or a private
 
03:46:58.710 --> 03:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
entity um there was talk about adding
 
03:47:00.309 --> 03:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
some language to include the
 
03:47:01.630 --> 03:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
restrictions that were included in the
 
03:47:04.269 --> 03:47:04.279 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill two years ago um I don't
 
03:47:07.070 --> 03:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
believe that language ever made it in
 
03:47:08.189 --> 03:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
the language that was in the trailer
 
03:47:10.309 --> 03:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
Bill two years ago is still in effect
 
03:47:12.110 --> 03:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
however um it applies to that original
 
03:47:15.550 --> 03:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
$8.75 million appropriation so I'm not
 
03:47:16.670 --> 03:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
really sure how that would be
 
03:47:18.429 --> 03:47:18.439 align:start position:0%
interpreted going forward given that
 
03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:27.910 --> 03:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
made Senator Morris yeah I'll be honest
 
03:47:29.790 --> 03:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
with you you're gonna be back here
 
03:47:31.510 --> 03:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
debating it because the numbers that
 
03:47:35.830 --> 03:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
were presented to the Senate um were 27
 
03:47:39.309 --> 03:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
million for 25 beds 50 million for 60
 
03:47:39.319 --> 03:47:40.070 align:start position:0%
million for 25 beds 50 million for 60
beds

03:47:40.070 --> 03:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
beds
 
03:47:42.389 --> 03:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
none of us in the Senate thought those
 
03:47:45.149 --> 03:47:45.159 align:start position:0%
numbers made any sense and I think we
 
03:47:46.990 --> 03:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
have to come back and figure out you
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
know let's get the construction going on
 
03:47:51.950 --> 03:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
this um because drf beds are tough to
 
03:47:53.429 --> 03:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
come by in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:47:54.590 --> 03:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
and if we can pull them out of New
 
03:47:57.750 --> 03:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and and use this I
 
03:48:00.189 --> 03:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
think it's part of the solution but I
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
believe the legislator is going to have
 
03:48:04.269 --> 03:48:04.279 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to operate it um I'm
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
not willing to take anything off the
 
03:48:07.550 --> 03:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
table and I'm not suggesting anything
 
03:48:10.349 --> 03:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
was put on the table because it was
 
03:48:12.550 --> 03:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
um what was in the last budget I didn't
 
03:48:14.990 --> 03:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
participate in so I don't I don't know
 
03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I think we I think we should
 
03:48:19.189 --> 03:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
just acknowledge that we've made some
 
03:48:21.149 --> 03:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
progress because from what was being
 
03:48:23.550 --> 03:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
proposed in March as a standalone
 
03:48:25.469 --> 03:48:25.479 align:start position:0%
building they've got a collocation
 
03:48:27.309 --> 03:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
that's going to save us on Staffing
 
03:48:30.389 --> 03:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
inevitably and so so already they've
 
03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
looked at the operational cost long term
 
03:48:35.269 --> 03:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
and figured out a way to to drive those
 
03:48:37.110 --> 03:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
down a little bit I I don't think we're
 
03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
done with the operational piece but when
 
03:48:42.110 --> 03:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
we did met on this there was no there
 
03:48:44.750 --> 03:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
were no operational estimates so so
 
03:48:46.269 --> 03:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
we're I think we're getting smarter but
 
03:48:47.950 --> 03:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
we are going to have to continue to to
 
03:48:50.389 --> 03:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
work through it so the house is going to
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
exceed to these two sections and
 
03:48:55.030 --> 03:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
obviously more work will be done both
 
03:48:57.070 --> 03:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
sides are talking about that work so we
 
03:48:59.710 --> 03:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
will move forward together that brings
 
03:49:04.349 --> 03:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
us to 420 Mr King section 420 and
 
03:49:07.269 --> 03:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
421 uh relate to an action taken in
 
03:49:10.990 --> 03:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
house bill one uh for non laap s some 21
 
03:49:13.269 --> 03:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
available funds for nursing services and
 
03:49:15.790 --> 03:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities of about $1 million
 
03:49:18.030 --> 03:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
which is budgeted in restricted account
 
03:49:20.630 --> 03:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
in house bill one so sections 420 and
 
03:49:23.910 --> 03:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
421 would allow that to occur the house
 
03:49:27.630 --> 03:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
exceeds to those two sections 422 please
 
03:49:27.640 --> 03:49:31.830 align:start position:0%
exceeds to those two sections 422 please
sections

03:49:31.830 --> 03:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:35.590 --> 03:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
422 U and 423 I believe it related to
 
03:49:37.790 --> 03:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
home visiting programs for Medicaid
 
03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
eligible pregnant women infant and
 
03:49:41.630 --> 03:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
families with children up to the age of
 
03:49:43.149 --> 03:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
one and Kevin do you have any more
 
03:49:46.910 --> 03:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
background on that I don't no okay so we
 
03:49:48.469 --> 03:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
don't have any additional background to
 
03:49:50.790 --> 03:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
defer to the Senate the house will
 
03:49:55.670 --> 03:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
exceed to the to the Senate section 424
 
03:49:57.710 --> 03:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
please section
 
03:50:00.910 --> 03:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
424 uh suspends The Graduate medical
 
03:50:04.750 --> 03:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
education payments um under the Medicaid
 
03:50:07.229 --> 03:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
Program uh upon approval of state plan
 
03:50:08.990 --> 03:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment shall be suspended through the
 
03:50:11.429 --> 03:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
B this is a similar section that's been
 
03:50:16.269 --> 03:50:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:20.149 --> 03:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
budgets if I could um Mr Ripple as I as
 
03:50:22.349 --> 03:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
I remember this this was one of another
 
03:50:25.510 --> 03:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
one of those examples of something that
 
03:50:28.030 --> 03:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
had been discontinued but had found
 
03:50:31.670 --> 03:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
another life in our uh H2S and and we
 
03:50:33.750 --> 03:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
just allowed it to die could you could
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
you correct my memory please uh I'm not
 
03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
sure there was a vote taken on whether
 
03:50:40.229 --> 03:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
to include this or not I believe it was
 
03:50:42.510 --> 03:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
included in language that the department
 
03:50:44.149 --> 03:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
presented to division 3 and asked
 
03:50:46.110 --> 03:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
division 3 to consider U but I don't
 
03:50:49.070 --> 03:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
think it was formally voted
 
03:50:51.229 --> 03:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
on repres
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
wer was this something we saw in the 529
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
unique program that they were going to
 
03:50:59.469 --> 03:50:59.479 align:start position:0%
take money out of that uh this is
 
03:51:01.510 --> 03:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
unrelated this is uh graduate medical
 
03:51:03.070 --> 03:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
education payments that go to hospitals
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
such as Dartmouth teaching hospitals um
 
03:51:07.510 --> 03:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
a supplemental payment provided to those
 
03:51:11.030 --> 03:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals that has not been um provided
 
03:51:13.590 --> 03:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh if I go back probably since
 
03:51:16.870 --> 03:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
2011 potential I I think I'm all in
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
favor anytime we suspend payments so I I
 
03:51:22.030 --> 03:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
I'd be okay with this the house exceeds
 
03:51:23.149 --> 03:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:51:25.750 --> 03:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
Senate section
 
03:51:29.950 --> 03:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
425 section 425 appropriates
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
$300,000 for fiscal year 22 and 23 for
 
03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
the Juvenile Diversion program and I
 
03:51:38.429 --> 03:51:38.439 align:start position:0%
believe Kevin correct me if I'm wrong
 
03:51:41.750 --> 03:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's also applies to section
 
03:51:49.389 --> 03:51:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:52.990 --> 03:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
yes so so Edwards do have a question
 
03:51:54.750 --> 03:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
thank thank you madam chair the division
 
03:51:57.670 --> 03:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
three uh did not discuss this so I don't
 
03:51:59.870 --> 03:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
know what the program parameters are
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
around this and so a seeding to this
 
03:52:04.469 --> 03:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
would be to rely on the Senate's
 
03:52:07.149 --> 03:52:07.159 align:start position:0%
judgment that this is money well spent
 
03:52:08.670 --> 03:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
and that there are metrics showing
 
03:52:08.680 --> 03:52:10.950 align:start position:0%
and that there are metrics showing
success

03:52:10.950 --> 03:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
success
 
03:52:14.189 --> 03:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
so this is something that uh Senator G
 
03:52:16.630 --> 03:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
pushed in in an amendment and something
 
03:52:19.229 --> 03:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
quite frankly that we have funded uh
 
03:52:21.349 --> 03:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
these diversionary programs to try to
 
03:52:26.950 --> 03:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
keep kids out of hot water um
 
03:52:29.710 --> 03:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
so they've been successful in the past
 
03:52:32.790 --> 03:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
we hope that you go along with us I'm
 
03:52:35.070 --> 03:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to trust the Senate the
 
03:52:36.070 --> 03:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
house will
 
03:52:39.790 --> 03:52:39.800 align:start position:0%
exceed we're on page 328 section
 
03:52:42.630 --> 03:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
427 sections
 
03:52:46.110 --> 03:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:50.189 --> 03:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
328 section 428 that continues on 328
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
goes through 329 and section 429 are
 
03:52:56.349 --> 03:52:56.359 align:start position:0%

benefit represent Madam chair
 
03:53:11.349 --> 03:53:11.359 align:start position:0%

that okay we will hold
 
03:53:17.670 --> 03:53:17.680 align:start position:0%

that

03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:54:52.590 --> 03:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
433 section 433 it is an appropriation
 
03:54:55.950 --> 03:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
of $1.5 million in fiscal 21 for the
 
03:54:57.590 --> 03:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
purpose of providing grants to senior
 
03:54:59.750 --> 03:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
centers serving senior citizens for
 
03:55:02.229 --> 03:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
supporing services combat struggles with
 
03:55:04.750 --> 03:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
Mental Health and Social isolation uh
 
03:55:06.990 --> 03:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
this was a section included in House
 
03:55:09.429 --> 03:55:09.439 align:start position:0%
Bill uh two as introd used it was
 
03:55:12.269 --> 03:55:12.279 align:start position:0%
removed uh by the house due to revenues
 
03:55:14.750 --> 03:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
and added back in the Senate um which
 
03:55:31.920 --> 03:55:31.930 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:31.930 --> 03:55:37.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:41.149 --> 03:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
nonlinguistic 's office as a way to
 
03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
upgrade U barrier materials and senior
 
03:55:46.990 --> 03:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
citizens centers and and because this is
 
03:55:49.229 --> 03:55:49.239 align:start position:0%
about seniors and it's the same number
 
03:55:52.469 --> 03:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
1.5 million I'm just curious is this the
 
03:55:55.189 --> 03:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
same appropriation under a slightly
 
03:55:56.990 --> 03:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
different purpose or are we doing
 
03:56:00.070 --> 03:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
something different here this is you saw
 
03:56:01.990 --> 03:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
this language in the house uh something
 
03:56:03.870 --> 03:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
very similar to it was included in the
 
03:56:06.070 --> 03:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended house bill to uh
 
03:56:08.189 --> 03:56:08.199 align:start position:0%
the only difference here is in addition
 
03:56:10.189 --> 03:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
to the roation being made out of fiscal
 
03:56:12.830 --> 03:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
21 is originally there was a provision
 
03:56:14.349 --> 03:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
allowing the money to be spent on
 
03:56:16.429 --> 03:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements and that
 
03:56:20.469 --> 03:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
language has been removed so no
 
03:56:22.950 --> 03:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure all right so so the bad
 
03:56:25.950 --> 03:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
part of it that was like 80 90% of it
 
03:56:28.189 --> 03:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
got removed and this this new purpose
 
03:56:30.429 --> 03:56:30.439 align:start position:0%
has been injected I I think we should
 
03:56:32.990 --> 03:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
hold this and discuss it because uh it's
 
03:56:34.710 --> 03:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
shape shifting under us okay we will
 
03:56:36.630 --> 03:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
hold 433 and
 
03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
434 435 Mr Mr K sure 435 is an
 
03:56:44.550 --> 03:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation in 21 of the Veterans Home
 
03:56:46.830 --> 03:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
Master Plan update this would uh
 
03:56:48.870 --> 03:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
initially was included in House Bill 25
 
03:56:51.189 --> 03:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
it was removed um in the which is the
 
03:56:53.030 --> 03:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
capital budget it was removed by the
 
03:56:55.429 --> 03:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
public works committees and instead uh
 
03:56:57.189 --> 03:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
the Senate included this as a 21
 
03:56:58.510 --> 03:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation I don't think this should
 
03:57:00.110 --> 03:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
have been bonded so the house will
 
03:57:02.429 --> 03:57:02.439 align:start position:0%
exceed to this okay so that includes
 
03:57:05.429 --> 03:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
sections 435 and 436 on the bottom of
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
page 331
 
03:57:11.670 --> 03:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
correct 437 we're going to pay off the
 
03:57:16.910 --> 03:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
mortgage yes on page 332 section 437 is
 
03:57:20.229 --> 03:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
currently a $2.75 million appropriation
 
03:57:21.910 --> 03:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
from the general fund to pay off the
 
03:57:24.429 --> 03:57:24.439 align:start position:0%
lottery building uh mortgage which they
 
03:57:27.389 --> 03:57:27.399 align:start position:0%
purchased last bium um it will reduce
 
03:57:29.670 --> 03:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
debt service costs by about $200,000 a
 
03:57:31.550 --> 03:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
year I believe we have an amendment for
 
03:57:35.149 --> 03:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Morse okay Senator Morris I have
 
03:57:35.159 --> 03:57:36.790 align:start position:0%
Senator Morse okay Senator Morris I have
amendment

03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:57:39.910 --> 03:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
1917s that would basically Ally just
 
03:57:42.830 --> 03:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
take the funding Lottery working with
 
03:57:44.950 --> 03:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
their accountants um said the
 
03:57:47.110 --> 03:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation to pay off the debt should
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
come out of Lottery which means we'll
 
03:57:51.469 --> 03:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
probably lower
 
03:57:54.349 --> 03:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
education um fund at the end of the year
 
03:57:56.349 --> 03:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
I would think I don't know might can't
 
03:57:59.189 --> 03:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
by 2.7 but we'll increase the general
 
03:58:02.349 --> 03:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
fund rainy day fund by 2.7 that's
 
03:58:04.910 --> 03:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
basically what this will do that's
 
03:58:07.189 --> 03:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
correct you move your
 
03:58:10.910 --> 03:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment sure if I can sure go ahead
 
03:58:12.590 --> 03:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley
 
03:58:15.670 --> 03:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
moves represent wer seconds the adoption
 
03:58:17.710 --> 03:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
of amendment
 
03:58:17.720 --> 03:58:19.309 align:start position:0%
of amendment
221-1

03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
221-1
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
917s all those in favor on the house
 
03:58:24.870 --> 03:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
side can I ask a question you may ask a
 
03:58:26.590 --> 03:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
03:58:30.550 --> 03:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
you um so this this money instead of
 
03:58:32.670 --> 03:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
coming out of general fund comes out of
 
03:58:36.070 --> 03:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
the lottery pot before Lottery transfers
 
03:58:39.309 --> 03:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
money out before okay
 
03:58:41.870 --> 03:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
Lottery's made a ton of money this year
 
03:58:44.309 --> 03:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
um so I know and I'm hoping they make a
 
03:58:48.550 --> 03:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
ton next year plus 2.7 but so it just
 
03:58:52.349 --> 03:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
this just really is uh making sure that
 
03:58:55.630 --> 03:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
Lottery keeps itself within
 
03:58:58.429 --> 03:58:58.439 align:start position:0%
Lottery no Lottery's accountants believe
 
03:59:00.149 --> 03:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
they have to do that but this was so
 
03:59:01.309 --> 03:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
that we save
 
03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
$400,000 the bud yeah all right no I did
 
03:59:07.870 --> 03:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
I got it okay thank you okay so the
 
03:59:10.830 --> 03:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
house is in favor raise your hand yes
 
03:59:10.840 --> 03:59:12.269 align:start position:0%
house is in favor raise your hand yes
the

03:59:12.269 --> 03:59:12.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
Senate motion passes and with that we
 
03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
have moved those two sections on I went
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
a hold on the Kino license fee okay
 
03:59:24.790 --> 03:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
which is section
 
03:59:29.389 --> 03:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
439 uh section 440 Mr Kane sure section
 
03:59:32.349 --> 03:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
440 um you remembered earlier today
 
03:59:35.189 --> 03:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
discussed how historic horse racing uh
 
03:59:36.790 --> 03:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
was signed into law by the governor I
 
03:59:39.349 --> 03:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
believe last week uh Senator GAA had an
 
03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
amendment Rel he was approached by one
 
03:59:43.950 --> 03:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
entity that uh would like to offer
 
03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
historic horse races um and as a result
 
03:59:50.269 --> 03:59:50.279 align:start position:0%
of that they did want to bump out the uh
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
date so someone who was operating as a
 
03:59:54.189 --> 03:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
May 1st 21 just so they could be
 
04:00:01.149 --> 04:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:06.309 --> 04:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:09.950 --> 04:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
Burger I'm not sure why we need a date
 
04:00:14.429 --> 04:00:14.439 align:start position:0%
in there at all I mean because if some
 
04:00:18.429 --> 04:00:18.439 align:start position:0%
other facility comes along in
 
04:00:22.269 --> 04:00:22.279 align:start position:0%
2025 does that mean I have to have a
 
04:00:28.309 --> 04:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:30.790 --> 04:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
racing Mr Kane do you want to answer
 
04:00:33.189 --> 04:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
that before I call on representative
 
04:00:35.750 --> 04:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
rosenal yeah so I probably defer to
 
04:00:40.110 --> 04:00:40.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosen okay Senator Rosen I think
 
04:00:45.510 --> 04:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
that in this language is um just kind of
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
a stop and limit the licenses just for
 
04:00:49.199 --> 04:00:50.070 align:start position:0%
a stop and limit the licenses just for
three

04:00:50.070 --> 04:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:00:53.510 --> 04:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
years while we establish a store course
 
04:00:57.110 --> 04:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
racing okay we can look into that I
 
04:00:59.990 --> 04:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
think you're you're you're right Cindy I
 
04:01:01.870 --> 04:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
forgot yeah represent
 
04:01:05.229 --> 04:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
wer I think we passed this historic
 
04:01:07.550 --> 04:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
horse racing and now if we throw any
 
04:01:09.830 --> 04:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
more stuff and as allow to be a conflict
 
04:01:11.469 --> 04:01:11.479 align:start position:0%
in the language I would just as soon
 
04:01:13.790 --> 04:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
take all this out of the
 
04:01:16.830 --> 04:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 because we've passed a bill in both
 
04:01:19.349 --> 04:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
House and Senate for historic horse
 
04:01:24.670 --> 04:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:27.710 --> 04:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
further normally OS will make sure
 
04:01:31.990 --> 04:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's no conflict between hb2 and
 
04:01:36.269 --> 04:01:36.279 align:start position:0%
whatever might have passed in some other
 
04:01:39.070 --> 04:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
legislation am I am I correct correct
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct section 441 the Senate
 
04:01:43.309 --> 04:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
has asked to put this on hold that is
 
04:01:44.710 --> 04:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
440 and
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
441 and uh 442 as well get Capt 42 thank

04:02:00.349 --> 04:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
443 and the house will exceed to the
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
Senate language I remove that money

04:07:01.030 --> 04:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh a little over a million dollars is
 
04:07:01.040 --> 04:07:02.990 align:start position:0%
uh a little over a million dollars is
General

04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
General
 
04:07:07.950 --> 04:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
funds so so so division three did not um
 
04:07:10.189 --> 04:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
cut these we we we supported the
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
governor's uh budget what we what we did
 
04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
do though was we uh imposed a ceiling at
 
04:07:19.990 --> 04:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
3,000 to give the commissioner
 
04:07:24.109 --> 04:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
flexibility to to hire priority hires
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
and um I'm I'm not I'm not sure where
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
these additional this additional head
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
count is coming from since it I don't
 
04:07:34.030 --> 04:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
believe it was sourced in the original
 
04:07:34.040 --> 04:07:35.309 align:start position:0%
believe it was sourced in the original
Governor's

04:07:35.309 --> 04:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
Governor's
 
04:07:39.149 --> 04:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
budget so um going going back into the
 
04:07:42.590 --> 04:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
2019 session when we passed Senate Bill
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
six we authorized all of these positions
 
04:07:48.790 --> 04:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
as I recall right now there are 37
 
04:07:52.630 --> 04:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
unfilled positions at DCF so what this
 
04:07:55.710 --> 04:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
amendment does in section
 
04:08:01.309 --> 04:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
461 it um funds 10 of them of the
 
04:08:03.670 --> 04:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
authorized positions over and above the
 
04:08:03.680 --> 04:08:05.030 align:start position:0%
authorized positions over and above the
37

04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
37
 
04:08:08.950 --> 04:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
unfilled and the remain in 12 because
 
04:08:11.349 --> 04:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
there were 22 additional positions that
 
04:08:13.750 --> 04:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
were authorized the remaining 12 could
 
04:08:17.550 --> 04:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
come back to fiscal for approval so it
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
was approved in the past budget um and
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
it the whole design of it is to get the
 
04:08:28.429 --> 04:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
case loads down to a manageable number
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
um per case worker but isn't the problem
 
04:08:35.189 --> 04:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
right now they have as you noted
 
04:08:38.670 --> 04:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
37 funded but unfilled positions so one
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
of the reasons the case loads don't go
 
04:08:42.910 --> 04:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
down is they can't find people to hire
 
04:08:44.910 --> 04:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
their positions rather than we're
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
shorting them staff isn't that where we
 
04:08:49.830 --> 04:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
are but we are not shorting them staff
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
no that's uh that's absolutely true
 
04:08:56.149 --> 04:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
these are difficult jobs to have um
 
04:08:58.710 --> 04:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
there's High turnover the department has
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
made a great effort since I think a
 
04:09:05.349 --> 04:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
number of us starting in
 
04:09:08.309 --> 04:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
2017 um you know senator Carson I think
 
04:09:09.710 --> 04:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
LED efforts
 
04:09:14.349 --> 04:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
to um increase the number of positions
 
04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
at DCF given some of the notable
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
failures that had happened of deaths
 
04:09:23.109 --> 04:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
among children under DCF care um the
 
04:09:25.149 --> 04:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate was formed
 
04:09:28.670 --> 04:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
at that point so over that period of
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
time many more positions have been um
 
04:09:35.990 --> 04:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
created and according to Senate Bill 6
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
from 20
 
04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
19 if all 22 of those positions and the
 
04:09:45.990 --> 04:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
37 positions that were unfilled were
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
filled then we would have a full
 
04:09:50.910 --> 04:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
compliment but again representative over
 
04:09:53.830 --> 04:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
because of the difficulty of the job um
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
so that's been that has been the issue I
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
think the department has um you know
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
made great strides in trying to improve
 
04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
dcyf but difficult jobs um certainly
 
04:10:09.109 --> 04:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by Co too so the second
 
04:10:10.870 --> 04:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
question I have before we leave that and
 
04:10:12.590 --> 04:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
then representative Wilder's got a
 
04:10:15.750 --> 04:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
question this and representative Edwards
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
touched on this these additional people
 
04:10:21.550 --> 04:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
still must be are not in
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
addition to the 3,000 they've allocated
 
04:10:29.950 --> 04:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
it's a cap of 3,000 employees but 10 of
 
04:10:32.309 --> 04:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
these may be part of that 3,000 is that
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
where you are well under Senate Bill six
 
04:10:37.870 --> 04:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember the overall number
 
04:10:42.630 --> 04:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
of new positions that were um funded but
 
04:10:45.109 --> 04:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
the my understanding is when the budget
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
was first submitted there were 22
 
04:10:49.349 --> 04:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
positions that were not included because
 
04:10:50.149 --> 04:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:10:52.870 --> 04:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
vacancies this amendment that the Senate
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
adopted would fund 10 of those 22 with
 
04:10:57.550 --> 04:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to come back but but still
 
04:11:01.149 --> 04:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
under the top Max of 3,000 employees for
 
04:11:05.550 --> 04:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
a CH yeah um LBA would have to answer
 
04:11:07.750 --> 04:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
that question I I do not know Mr okay
 
04:11:10.550 --> 04:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
the house would like this to be clear
 
04:11:13.510 --> 04:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
that it's still 3,000 is the top number
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
of employees that HHS may have okay so
 
04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
we'll um we could draft an amendment to
 
04:11:22.990 --> 04:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
refer to that section in house Bell one
 
04:11:24.429 --> 04:11:24.439 align:start position:0%
just to make sure it's consistent with
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
the actions taken by the committee on
 
04:11:29.590 --> 04:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
house B one would that be a new section
 
04:11:34.189 --> 04:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
um we could probably add it um to these
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
Provisions since this is chapter law we
 
04:11:39.630 --> 04:11:39.640 align:start position:0%
could probably just St a sub paragraph 3
 
04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh clarifying
 
04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
that so if representative Edwards if
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that we will have to
 
04:11:47.870 --> 04:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
hold this representative wer still got a
 
04:11:50.990 --> 04:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
question but representative wer thank
 
04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
you madam chair since we earlier decided
 
04:11:55.510 --> 04:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
to eliminate positions that had been
 
04:11:57.309 --> 04:11:57.319 align:start position:0%
empty for three years that might apply
 
04:11:59.670 --> 04:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
to many of these positions so there's
 
04:12:01.750 --> 04:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
might be a conflict here when Senate
 
04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
Bill six and 19 so my understanding is
 
04:12:07.349 --> 04:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
that when we adopted this amendment we
 
04:12:11.070 --> 04:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
overrode that provision okay um because
 
04:12:15.429 --> 04:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
of the the need quite frankly to protect
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
children from abuse and neglect I'm just
 
04:12:20.109 --> 04:12:20.119 align:start position:0%
wondering if we need to add language to
 
04:12:30.070 --> 04:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:33.870 --> 04:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
exception Mr Kane did we already do
 
04:12:36.630 --> 04:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
that so you've adopted the section
 
04:12:38.349 --> 04:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
relative to to abolish positions which
 
04:12:40.870 --> 04:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
is a previous section um just not off
 
04:12:44.950 --> 04:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
the top of my head uh there is a um if
 
04:12:46.510 --> 04:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
you would like when we're drafting the
 
04:12:49.030 --> 04:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
amendment here we can reference that
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
previous section relative to abolished
 
04:12:52.510 --> 04:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
positions just to make sure that this
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
does not
 
04:12:57.429 --> 04:12:57.439 align:start position:0%
apply please so we will hold this
 
04:13:02.429 --> 04:13:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.469 --> 04:13:05.479 align:start position:0%
discussing which is going to bring us
 
04:13:10.750 --> 04:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
454 yes so the um 3544 correct section
 
04:13:21.149 --> 04:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
462 yes section 462 is an appropriation
 
04:13:21.159 --> 04:13:21.910 align:start position:0%
462 yes section 462 is an appropriation
of

04:13:21.910 --> 04:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:13:27.309 --> 04:13:27.319 align:start position:0%
$600,000 and22 and $600,000 23 uh to HHS
 
04:13:28.710 --> 04:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of funding Community
 
04:13:30.910 --> 04:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
collaborations and parental Assistance
 
04:13:34.750 --> 04:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
programs um at
 
04:13:37.229 --> 04:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
HHS representative Edwards are we in
 
04:13:42.149 --> 04:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:44.910 --> 04:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
this we don't actually know what this is
 
04:13:46.750 --> 04:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
so we should hold this and get an
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
explanation of of what this community
 
04:13:51.109 --> 04:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
Assistance looks like because because I
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think we talk about this
 
04:13:55.910 --> 04:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
maybe Mr Ripple could help us right
 
04:13:58.510 --> 04:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
now I can give you a brief explanation I
 
04:13:59.950 --> 04:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
know the funds would be used for
 
04:14:02.990 --> 04:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
contracts with four entities to
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
facilitate improved parent child
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
interactions and reduce child Mal
 
04:14:07.950 --> 04:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
treatment and I know that one of the
 
04:14:09.309 --> 04:14:09.319 align:start position:0%
contracts would be the department of
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
corrections as far as what specifically
 
04:14:14.990 --> 04:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
the funds are used for I'm not sure okay
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're gonna hold
 
04:14:20.109 --> 04:14:20.119 align:start position:0%
this uh Mr Kane I would like you to pass
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
out Amendment 2021 D1
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:36.080 --> 04:14:42.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:14:42.269 --> 04:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:06.000 --> 04:15:07.870 align:start position:0%
 
copy

04:15:07.870 --> 04:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
copy
 
04:15:09.950 --> 04:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay to my friends in the Senate with 24
 
04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
members we in the house have 400 members
 
04:15:16.229 --> 04:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
we will be having our last house session
 
04:15:19.710 --> 04:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
still in the Bedford Sports Arena now
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
that the executive orders have expired
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
we have no way to pay house members

04:17:04.910 --> 04:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
the House's position that we would like
 
04:17:12.510 --> 04:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:16.750 --> 04:17:16.760 align:start position:0%

this that is actually I think we're at
 
04:17:30.630 --> 04:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
the end oh Karen do you have an
 
04:17:33.269 --> 04:17:33.279 align:start position:0%

04:17:59.109 --> 04:17:59.119 align:start position:0%
line I think the hard copies of that one
 
04:18:00.590 --> 04:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
were left across the street so we don't
 
04:18:02.429 --> 04:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
have to bring those back over sorry
 
04:18:07.349 --> 04:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
about that delete Amendment no
 
04:18:11.469 --> 04:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
no no it's not it should be but it
 
04:18:14.070 --> 04:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
isn't okay so if you could yeah we can
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
wait till tomorrow on this it's no no
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%

04:18:22.030 --> 04:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
chief of staff for looking this up for
 
04:18:24.429 --> 04:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
me if we could turn back to page
 
04:18:28.710 --> 04:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
346 the house that originally said hold
 
04:18:30.510 --> 04:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
on Section
 
04:18:33.149 --> 04:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
448 however we have passed it so now I
 
04:18:34.990 --> 04:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
wonder if we need this or we should
 
04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
delete it
 
04:18:42.389 --> 04:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
um I would hope that the uh senate or
 
04:18:44.349 --> 04:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
the house would go along with this um
 
04:18:47.070 --> 04:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
it's very important to sen guy well I
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%

04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%

04:18:52.920 --> 04:18:53.950 align:start position:0%

04:19:01.389 --> 04:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
so not been signed in a law but it's
 
04:19:03.429 --> 04:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
going you think the governor is going to
 
04:19:03.439 --> 04:19:05.269 align:start position:0%
going you think the governor is going to

04:19:12.840 --> 04:19:14.469 align:start position:0%

that they would like to hold on things I
 
04:19:36.349 --> 04:19:36.359 align:start position:0%

04:20:13.920 --> 04:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
same

04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%

04:20:56.349 --> 04:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment 202 one-1 1939 s from Senator
 
04:20:58.870 --> 04:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
Bradley Senator Bradley yes thank you
 
04:21:01.790 --> 04:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
very much Madam chair
 
04:21:05.510 --> 04:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
um this amendment ensures that the
 
04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
provisions of House Bill two with regard
 
04:21:12.109 --> 04:21:12.119 align:start position:0%
to body warn dashboard camera fund take
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
precedence over Senate Bill
 
04:21:17.950 --> 04:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
96 um this is fleshed out the
 
04:21:20.469 --> 04:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
appropriation more as I recall Senate
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 96 only had a dollar
 
04:21:25.389 --> 04:21:25.399 align:start position:0%
appropriated um and it had somewhat
 
04:21:27.269 --> 04:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
different language but I think this is a
 
04:21:30.229 --> 04:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive
 
04:21:33.510 --> 04:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
approach represent bumberger
 
04:21:36.469 --> 04:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 96 did not come to you
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
because the house did not do second
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
committee bill so you didn't see it but
 
04:21:42.030 --> 04:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
I did read it over the weekend because
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley had called me it would
 
04:21:46.109 --> 04:21:46.119 align:start position:0%
have come to you if we done second
 
04:21:46.119 --> 04:21:49.229 align:start position:0%
have come to you if we done second
committee

04:21:49.229 --> 04:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:51.790 --> 04:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
bills my understanding is that the
 
04:21:54.149 --> 04:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
department of safety is currently
 
04:21:57.510 --> 04:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
looking to get a
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive contract to lease body
 
04:22:01.990 --> 04:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
cameras which will make it cheaper
 
04:22:04.750 --> 04:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
overall and this ensures that not only
 
04:22:06.790 --> 04:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
these guys but Department of corre c s
 
04:22:09.630 --> 04:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
in their use would be using the same
 
04:22:11.950 --> 04:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
contract uh for leasing which will
 
04:22:18.309 --> 04:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:20.790 --> 04:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
significantly I I guess because I did
 
04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
not see SB 96 96 I know
 
04:22:30.389 --> 04:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
I telling you this this looks exactly
 
04:22:34.950 --> 04:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
like the language we already have in
 
04:22:36.910 --> 04:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
there but if
 
04:22:39.630 --> 04:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
must not my understanding is the only
 
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
real um change to the Senate version of
 
04:22:47.389 --> 04:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
hb2 with regard to this is that the
 
04:22:49.710 --> 04:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
04:22:53.469 --> 04:22:53.479 align:start position:0%
um ensures that this provision take
 
04:22:58.349 --> 04:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
a.m. so one minute past midnight this
 
04:23:10.910 --> 04:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
goes into
 
04:23:14.189 --> 04:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
effect doesn't have an
 
04:23:16.389 --> 04:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
appropriation the appropriation remains
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
in section 146 unchanged that's a
 
04:23:18.720 --> 04:23:28.670 align:start position:0%
in section 146 unchanged that's a
million

04:23:28.670 --> 04:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:35.279 --> 04:24:05.189 align:start position:0%
 
time

04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:05.199 --> 04:25:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:10.950 --> 04:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
if it helps representative bumberger I I
 
04:25:13.710 --> 04:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
didn't notice any changes except the
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
addition of the RSA 612 reference and
 
04:25:21.790 --> 04:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
mistaken the reason I say that is that
 
04:25:27.229 --> 04:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
date you had the effective date here I
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
think of June 30th
 
04:25:37.990 --> 04:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
2021 that's the Appropriations that's
 
04:25:38.000 --> 04:25:49.830 align:start position:0%
2021 that's the Appropriations that's
the

04:25:49.830 --> 04:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
Appropriations yeah yeah thank you madam
 
04:25:54.189 --> 04:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
chair uh could someone once again just
 
04:25:56.870 --> 04:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
explain what the purpose of this is and
 
04:26:00.429 --> 04:26:00.439 align:start position:0%
exactly what it accomplishes thank you
 
04:26:03.790 --> 04:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of this well let let's
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
back up a little bit it was a
 
04:26:07.309 --> 04:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the leak commission
 
04:26:09.910 --> 04:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
that the governor um implemented last
 
04:26:14.070 --> 04:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
year that um to the extent possible um
 
04:26:17.950 --> 04:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
police forces have dashboard or body
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
video um just
 
04:26:23.469 --> 04:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
to keep a record if you will of anything
 
04:26:25.590 --> 04:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
that might happen I think it's broadly
 
04:26:28.349 --> 04:26:28.359 align:start position:0%
supported by law enforcement you know in
 
04:26:30.309 --> 04:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
my conversations with the chiefs of
 
04:26:34.269 --> 04:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
police they um are fully supportive of
 
04:26:36.149 --> 04:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
this I think it's a way of protecting AC
 
04:26:40.309 --> 04:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
ing police officers um so I get all that
 
04:26:42.710 --> 04:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just the the actual change the
 
04:26:44.510 --> 04:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
slight difference in the wording what
 
04:26:47.750 --> 04:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
does that accomplish well as I said
 
04:26:51.070 --> 04:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
before it's the effective date um to
 
04:26:53.309 --> 04:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that this supersede Senate
 
04:26:53.319 --> 04:26:55.389 align:start position:0%
make sure that this supersede Senate
Bill

04:26:55.389 --> 04:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:26:55.399 --> 04:26:57.790 align:start position:0%
Bill
96

04:26:57.790 --> 04:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
96
 
04:27:02.269 --> 04:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
um had a slight had different
 
04:27:05.109 --> 04:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
language incate Bill 96 would take
 
04:27:08.389 --> 04:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
effect on July 1 usually at midnight so
 
04:27:11.469 --> 04:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
by putting in the July 1st 2021 at 12:01
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
a.m. uh that ensures that the house bill
 
04:27:18.590 --> 04:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:21.550 --> 04:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
that uh I I'm not having any problem
 
04:27:26.070 --> 04:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
with this I just okay I just so do we
 
04:27:29.309 --> 04:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
