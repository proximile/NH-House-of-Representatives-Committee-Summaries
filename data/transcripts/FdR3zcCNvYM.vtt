percentage from 50 to 65 percent
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
that a person minimum sentence
 
00:10:38.449 --> 00:10:38.459 align:start position:0%
could be possibly go before the parole
 
00:10:38.459 --> 00:10:39.829 align:start position:0%
could be possibly go before the parole
board

00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
we also changed the
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
sentenced to a minimum of not less than
 
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:47.540 align:start position:0%
seven and a half years
 
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
and we also made sure that it was not
 
00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:52.430 align:start position:0%
and we also made sure that it was not
um

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
you could retroactive
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
so it will start from the effective date
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.190 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second
 
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.350 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second
representative

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
I fully Concur and agree with that and I
 
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
hope that the members would look at this
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
favorably we looked at it we talked
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
about it together we worked on it we
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
took care of some of the concerns we had
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
and I I think that it's important to
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
give incarcerated people
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
um at least a chance at the hope that if
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
they work hard and follow the rules that
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
have a chance at an earlier release and
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
it's only a chance because I still have
 
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:44.839 align:start position:0%
to go by the parole board
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
so I think this is a good thing and I
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
would encourage the members to support
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would ask the clerk to
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.700 align:start position:0%

very good bill

you know um
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
I guess verbiage in our books that we
 
00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
have here and um in the laws so
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
one thing about this that was a little
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
bit different from some of the others is
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
that this one is strictly on Behavior
 
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
you have to change your behavior to even
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
get this where others that are on the
 
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
books today is not based on a change in
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
the person's Behavior it's based on you
 
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
the person's Behavior it's based on you
know

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
let me do this just so I can get out you
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
can't do that with this particular one
 
00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy that the team decided to um
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%

00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%

uh I just want to acknowledge the
 
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
powerful testimony that we heard during
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
public hearing of people who went to
 
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
prison as teenagers uh displayed good
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
behavior and wanted that hope of getting
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
out based on that good behavior and I
 
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%

something that I would I would like for
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
everybody just to kind of like focus on
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
and follow up to everything that's
 
00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
already been said is just how hard we
 
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
really worked on this and all the
 
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
stakeholders actually listened to every
 
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
single thing that people didn't like and
 
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
addressed that and if you have you know
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
committed a violent crime against
 
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
um a child this is not going to count
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
for you that you're no
 
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
um in addition to that you know if you
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
get yourself in trouble once you know
 
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
you're you're already incarcerated
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't apply there
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
um in and and the biggest thing is
 
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
um any kind of crime like a sexual
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
nature doesn't apply and for that I
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
think is
 
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
why we're actually all able to
 
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
sounds like come together so um just
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to acknowledge that
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion radio
 
00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:56.090 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Murphy thank you Mr
chair

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
um I will be supporting this bill though
 
00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
I do wish I recognize the value and and
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's why I will be voting in support
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
the only thing that I wish that it had
 
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
and I think I'm hoping that we can look
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
at down the road is
 
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
um you know as a strong child advocate
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
um I think this has got great value but
 
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
I also worry about other vulnerable
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
populations like this disabled or the
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
elderly and then we have a carve out for
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
children which is a great thing but a
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
violent crime if you're the victim it
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if you're 17 or 19 or 85
 
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing that is a little
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
rough on me but I will I will support
 
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
the bill because I recognize the the
 
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.829 align:start position:0%
the bill because I recognize the the
value

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and I acknowledge it as well
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
no bill is perfect and there's always
 
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
rooms to work on it and I hope that we
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
can look at those issues in the coming
 
00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
year and see if we can fix that as well
 
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
um any further discussion
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none that will ask the clerk to
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%

House Bill 653 will be not taking that
 
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
up today there's issues that need to be
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
worked on with the sponsor and other
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
people so we're not taking it up House
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
Bill 624 relative to immigration
 
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
checkpoints I hereby open the executive
 
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
session and I recognize representative
 
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
stone for a motion
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to make a
 
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
motion to re excuse me to uh itl 624
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
well here's a second
 
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
second by representative tanza uh
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to speak
 
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
to your motion Mr chair I would
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
uh we should not be uh placing
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
responsibility of notification
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
requirements on state or local law
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies in regards to this
 
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
bill uh the sole purpose of the BPA are
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for the border security of
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
the United States and that would also
 
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
lead to impeding their efforts
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tensor I would
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
like to speak to you a second
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
I concur with representative Stone
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I also Concur and I I believe
 
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:15.539 align:start position:0%
that at a time right now especially a
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
northern border they're seeing um
 
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
unlawful Crossings up over 300 percent
 
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
um we don't need to interfere in the
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
process of the federal government is
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
trying to take care of that this
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
whatever way they choose it's not within
 
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.230 align:start position:0%
whatever way they choose it's not within
our

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
our bail a week to deal with and our law
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement has enough to do without
 
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
worrying about this issue and further
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Newell
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
yeah I just I just wanted to comment um
 
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
especially given what's been said so far
 
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
as it you know it it's very very
 
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
straightforward and very simple
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
um it really doesn't take a lot to to
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
just put up a notification there are a
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
variety of different ways that you could
 
00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
do that the bill provides for a variety
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
of different uh ways to be able to just
 
00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
notify people
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
um so that it is not an inconvenience to
 
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
our tourists and travelers and residents
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
and things like that I I just think um
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh I just I just want to
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
um amplify the the Simplicity of it you
 
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
know just things very basic
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you and and I appreciate and um
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
understand your motives for it and um it
 
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
is doable
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
um having said that I just don't want to
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
do it I don't think that it's at this
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
point something that is unnecessary but
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
I do understand it further discussion
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
oh yeah representative
 
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
so one of the one of the issues is that
 
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
these stops can take place
 
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.100 align:start position:0%
um up to 100 miles away from the border
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
and there have been uh some some of
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
these uh checkpoints have actually been
 
00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
set up uh not really even close uh to
 
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
the Border uh in the past we have no
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
guarantees that those won't be set up
 
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.529 align:start position:0%
guarantees that those won't be set up
again

00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:03.539 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
when these happen they present an
 
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of difficulty especially
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
the ones that are set up in the notch
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
during tourist season for local
 
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
residents and I think one of the things
 
00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:18.059 align:start position:0%
that they do is they create an
 
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
environment of fear for people who are
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
new to this country or who don't
 
00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily look like the majority of
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
um this is a very simple thing it
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't get in the way of the
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement activity all it does is
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
provide notice advance notice to people
 
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
that this is something that's going to
 
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
be taking place it's something we
 
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
already require for sobriety checkpoints
 
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:45.539 align:start position:0%
in this state so
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand the issue
 
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:52.340 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against it eitl thank you
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes where you
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
representative here Gathering
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes I'm going to be voting against the
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
itls as well we had we heard quite a bit
 
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
of testimony that you know that people
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
are stopped and they're really not being
 
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.830 align:start position:0%
are stopped and they're really not being
stopped

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
stopped
 
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:12.059 align:start position:0%
um you know for the causes that they
 
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
give because they send Dogs Out bring
 
00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
dogs out and now they check in the car
 
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
and really interrupting the person's day
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
and from my understanding the same way
 
00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
that our officers our law enforcement is
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
notified that the stops are going to
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
occur so it's not like there's anything
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
special anything new that our
 
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.110 align:start position:0%
special anything new that our
um

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
state troopers would have to do but
 
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
notify folks so that folks can at least
 
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
know I'm going to get stopped today I
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
might be late to work and whatever the
 
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
course of the day may be so I think it's
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
really a good film it's a good um
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
gesture just for anyone that's near the
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
borderline and I had to agree with um
 
00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.669 align:start position:0%
borderline and I had to agree with um
representative

00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:00.299 align:start position:0%
um use that
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's so far away from the
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
Line crossing the border I think that
 
00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
distance is ridiculous so I would be
 
00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059 align:start position:0%
voting against the itl
 
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
um I I appreciate that as well that is a
 
00:23:18.169 --> 00:23:18.179 align:start position:0%
long distance 100 miles having said that
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
the appropriate place for that to be
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
addressed would be to our federal
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
delegation I'm concerned that this would
 
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
pit our local law enforcement against
 
00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement and what would
 
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
happen is the federal law enforcement
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
would just cease to notify the local law
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement because it interferes in
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
their mission
 
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we need to put our law
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement in between us and the
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
it just pits them in the middle of it
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
like two parents fighting and I just
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a good idea to put them
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
in that position representative Stone
 
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd just like to
 
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:54.059 align:start position:0%
point out that Federal immigration is
 
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
exactly that handled by the federal
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
government is not a state entity it is
 
00:23:59.810 --> 00:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
not a state enforcement it is strictly
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
Federal which means we cannot really
 
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
interfere with them conducting their
 
00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.289 align:start position:0%
interfere with them conducting their
checkpoints

00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
checkpoints
 
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:09.419 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I want to agree
 
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
with what representative Muse and
 
00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:12.299 align:start position:0%
representative gathwright said but I
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
would also add on to president
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative gather I'd said it's not
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
just a impediment on your day it's an
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
impediment on your Fourth Amendment
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
right uh to
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
and I I really do think that that's
 
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
um the biggest uh concern for me here is
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we have a it seems to me a hundred
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
mile zone between uh the border and the
 
00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.059 align:start position:0%
coast which encompasses our entire state
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
where the Fourth Amendment does not
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
apply if the federal government chooses
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
to run one of these checkpoints and we
 
00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:45.419 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from uh people like Mr
 
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
Fuentes in the audience there who told
 
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
us about what it was like to to go
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
through one of these checkpoints and I'm
 
00:24:53.169 --> 00:24:53.179 align:start position:0%
not I'm sure all of us understand that
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's definitely something that was of
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
a tad bit of concern to us I think the
 
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
federal government would notify us I
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
disagree with your concern but hear that
 
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
I think they would ultimately notify the
 
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
state if they were to run a checkpoint
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
on our interstates or our roads
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
um as they have in the past and I think
 
00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:15.299 align:start position:0%
this legislation is is as representative
 
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
Newell said simple enough to to pass it
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
we it's not restricting the federal
 
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
government use of these checkpoints or
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
saying that you can't do them anymore
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's just saying the public should be
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
notified just as we are in a sobriety
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
checkpoint and considering these are
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
impeding traffic and impeding people's
 
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
rights I think are the state government
 
00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
just as we did for guns saying we're
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
going to stand up against the federal
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
government and make sure that your
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment is protected is the
 
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
right thing to do so I'll be voting
 
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
against the ideal motion thank you I
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
appreciate your consistency in reminding
 
00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
us of the recent debate I was having
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
Deja Vu I didn't know where I heard this
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
argument before
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
um representative who's next to you oh
 
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
um much of what representative wheeler
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
said is
 
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
um my concern as well I feel like in
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
this committee we've been good at
 
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
understanding you know the roles of the
 
00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:12.539 align:start position:0%
state and federal law enforcement and
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
how they apply differently to things in
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
our state and I don't see how asking our
 
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement to notify the
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
public that their constitutional rights
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
will be superseded in the event they
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
come across one of these checkpoints is
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
asking them to interfere in federal law
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement's efforts especially since
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
to my understanding these checkpoints
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
don't often even result in a slow of
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
illegal immigration or anything they're
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
just used as a way to
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
incarcerate and charge New Hampshire
 
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
citizens with completely different
 
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
crimes that are found out through their
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights being violated
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
when they're pulled over without cause
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
and their vehicles are searched and
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
their identities are questioned it's
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
just setting up
 
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
um you know the it's setting up people
 
00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:03.539 align:start position:0%
to have their rides violated without due
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
cause and without even I think good
 
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
reason because of the lack of efficacy
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
of these efforts in the first place by
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement to slow illegal
 
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.970 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement to slow illegal
immigration

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
um so I I would definitely be voting
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
against the itl motion I think that as
 
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
we've had discussions in this committee
 
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
before when citizens are being asked to
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
give up certain rights they should know
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be asked to do so
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
it should be under a specific set of
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances and allowing federal law
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
enforcement to come into our state and
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
harass New Hampshire citizens just
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
whenever they please does not
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
um make sense to me thank you
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative salic
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you just to add a personal
 
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
with the usaid and therefore I was born
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
out of the country my first passport
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
photos were taken when I was 10 years
 
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.070 align:start position:0%
photos were taken when I was 10 years
old

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
old
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
um but when I have been stopped which I
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
have at checkpoints in this country and
 
00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
they find out that I was born in
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
Pakistan the first question they asked
 
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
was me for proof that I'm a U.S citizen
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
I don't normally travel with my passport
 
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
if I have noticed that there's going to
 
00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
be a potential checkpoints in the areas
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
where I'm traveling around the state
 
00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
then I know that I need that day to make
 
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
sure I have my passport with me because
 
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
they don't view my driver's license
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
which is a verified driver's license
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
with all the extra checks on it as
 
00:28:30.289 --> 00:28:30.299 align:start position:0%
sufficient enough and the number of
 
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
questions I have to go through
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
as a child of two U.S citizens as a U.S
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
citizen and as someone who was born out
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
of the country because my father was
 
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
representing the US government still
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
leads me to have challenges
 
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you may I inquire how do they know
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
that you weren't born in the United
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
States based on your driver's license
 
00:28:51.649 --> 00:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
they don't know it based on my driver's
 
00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
license they ask questions such as where
 
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
were you born and when I say I was born
 
00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
in ralphindy Pakistan
 
00:28:59.690 --> 00:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
they say you know can you prove your
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
citizenship and I'm like well if you
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
want to go to my house and grab my
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
passport sure and they're like well you
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
know we're blah blah blah from your
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
it's an issue thank you that's a very uh
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
very interesting point
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
um further discussion representative
 
00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:16.250 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
um I also think we heard in testimony
 
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
that often these stops happen on like
 
00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:24.059 align:start position:0%
super busy holiday weekends Labor Day
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
weekend Bike Week Etc and not only does
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
that make highway traffic more dangerous
 
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
for the public but it also has um it's
 
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
severely hampering the experiences of
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire families when they're
 
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
trying to enjoy these weekends you know
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
I can say as someone who lives in
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire going up to
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
Laconia is not something that happens
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
every week and if I'm gonna make an hour
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
drive I want to know that I'm going to
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
get to where I want to go with my family
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
in an hour and I'm not going to be at a
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
checkpoint on a holiday weekend for six
 
00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
hours because all these cars are getting
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
stopped randomly
 
00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:56.580 align:start position:0%

motion representative
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is it brings
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
the uh the current bill uh 100 in line
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
with the bill that overwhelmingly passed

in the house last year
 
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
what the amendment actually does is
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
provide some additional species
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
more specifics it provides more
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
specifics uh around the notification
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
requirement itself and how it's uh how

it's supposed to be done this amendment
 
00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:18.860 align:start position:0%
uh I believe came to us from the ACLU

last year and they they were they
 
00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:24.419 align:start position:0%

getting us over the home with this one
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%

the uh the same bill that passed
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
but realistically I'm I'm not sure uh
 
00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
how much this particular enforcement
 
00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
effort actually helps us uh and one of
 
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
the things unfortunately that it does
 
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
accomplish is it it violates the rights
 
00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:50.300 align:start position:0%
of some of our citizens
 
00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
and it uh
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
it's it's something that uh and I think
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
what we're not doing is we're not
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
nullifying federal law we're not
 
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
overturning New Hampshire law all we're
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
basically saying is is if you're going
 
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
to do this notify us and given the fact
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
that stopping traffic on a major
 
00:35:14.569 --> 00:35:14.579 align:start position:0%
interstate highway like I-93 uh can
 
00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339 align:start position:0%
present safety issues and traffic issues
 
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
this seems to be a pretty pretty
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable thing to do and it's
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
something we already do for sobriety
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
checkpoints so I would urge folks to to
 
00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:29.579 align:start position:0%
maybe take another look at it and uh uh
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
and vote your conscience thank you thank
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
you for your great specificity
 
00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:38.339 align:start position:0%
um representative Newell did you want to
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
speak in a sec who's seconded it
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Harry gathway would you
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
like the second uh I just want to make a
 
00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
comment because I I think I heard
 
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
someone say that um
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
um we do not want
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
our officers to work with the federal
 
00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:53.660 align:start position:0%
government et cetera et cetera however
 
00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:56.339 align:start position:0%
the animals that are being brought out
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
there are brought out by our law
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement not by the federal
 
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.890 align:start position:0%
enforcement not by the federal
government

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
you're talking about working dogs right
 
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I was confused about things I'm
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
talking about the dogs that usually they
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
come to smell for drugs
 
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you
 
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
um represent Stone
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just like to point
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
out that uh part of border patrol is
 
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
responsible for drug enforcement so that
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
does fall into their purview uh the
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
other thing I want to point out is uh
 
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
these checkpoints
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
if you give proper notice and people
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
avoid them it defeats the purpose of
 
00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
doing them if you have the thought
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
process of well maybe we should notice
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
everybody well maybe we should do that
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
for every crime so that they know where
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
we're doing everything and in regards to
 
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:50.339 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court issuing orders for
 
00:36:52.609 --> 00:36:52.619 align:start position:0%
sobriety checkpoints that's actually one
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
element of a huge packet that has to be
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
authorized by a Superior Court Justice
 
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
it includes notifications just one
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
element of that there's a lot more that
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
falls into it
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:37:02.339 --> 00:37:03.410 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
janburn

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
janburn
 
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out uh in reading
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment now this is otpa so I'm
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
going to talk about the amendment it
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
states clearly that when an estate
 
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
County or Municipal Police Department or
 
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies informed they
 
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.170 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies informed they
shall

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
shall
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh and and then I go to the New
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution Article 28a the
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
state shall not mandate or assign any
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
new expanded or modified programs or
 
00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to any political
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
subdivision in any way to necessitate
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
additional local expenditures by the
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
political subdivision unless such
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
programs or responsibilities are fully
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
funded by the state or unless such
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
programs or responsibilities are
 
00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
approved by the funding by a vote of the
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
local legislative body or the political
 
00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
subdivision I am definitely a no on this
 
00:37:49.859 --> 00:37:50.810 align:start position:0%
subdivision I am definitely a no on this
vote

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that concern uh however I
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
do believe the amendment says they can
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
use their website which would be no
 
00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
additional cost
 
00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
um representative new Newman
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
I just want to remind the committee that
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
we as we've said in previous sessions we
 
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
vote on policy if this in fact is a
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
violation of 28a it goes to finance they
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
make the determination that it isn't a
 
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.270 align:start position:0%
make the determination that it isn't a
violation

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
violation
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
the that takes care of that
 
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
um further discussion representative
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:31.079 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean throughout this conversation
 
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's just kind of um reminded me of you
 
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
know the story that I was talking about
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
with uh testing and analyzing equipment
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
and and why you know that being
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
considered uh what was in my car was
 
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
considered drug paraphernalia allowed
 
00:38:47.569 --> 00:38:47.579 align:start position:0%
them to negate my civil liberties and uh
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing and I feel like
 
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
essentially what this does at the end of
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
the day is sets up a situation like that
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
but it is casting a very wide net
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
um in order to really not accomplish its
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
goal uh at the end of the day what it
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
does is it uh you know at the end of the
 
00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
day what it what the
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
outcome is is catching a lot of people
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
doing you know other things that uh
 
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
wouldn't warrant this type of behavior
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
um and not its intended goal thank you
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative salig
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
thank you just to Echo what
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Newell Singh in 2022 one
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
of the checkpoints said zero zero
 
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.890 align:start position:0%
of the checkpoints said zero zero
immigration

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
um detentions but between 13 and 16
 
00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.250 align:start position:0%
um detentions but between 13 and 16
marijuana

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
um detentions
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
if the goal of these checkpoints is to
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
catch illegal immigrants or people
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
crossing the border without permission
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
then that should be the focus not
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.770 align:start position:0%
 
Murray

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
Murray
 
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair I just wanted to make a
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
quick comment that you know we do notify
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
about sobriety checkpoints and as far as
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
I know they are still very effective I
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
think like potentially you know it could
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
be argued that um to make immigration
 
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
checkpoints less effective but I think
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
that needs to be weighed against at one
 
00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:05.339 align:start position:0%
point do we allow our civil liberties
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
and constitutional rights to be
 
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
superseded by the government and I think
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
this is one of these cases where we need
 
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619 align:start position:0%
to put New Hampshire citizens and their
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
rights first as per usual the ad in this
 
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.870 align:start position:0%
rights first as per usual the ad in this
committee

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.109 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
I found Representatives selig's points
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
very compelling I too have a son with a
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
consular report of birth who was born in
 
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.010 align:start position:0%
consular report of birth who was born in
Germany

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
Germany
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
um so that it does seem to be rather
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
burdensome for New Hampshire citizens so

um without a close executive session and
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%

House Bill 596 and I recognize
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
representative tenzar for motion yes
 
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.660 align:start position:0%

00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
itl house bill 596.
 
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
second second
 
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
about representative Stone
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
I think Stone made the motion right we
 
00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative was right behind him um
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak the emotion
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh yes thank you again
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I I'd like to thank
 
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative Muse for taking time to
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
craft this bill however I am voting itl
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
as this bill is duplicative in nature as
 
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
the federal Civil Rights bill covers
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
this it's just another mirror Bill also
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh police standards and training has
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
courses on civil rights so they're
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
teaching their new officers about this
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
and also departments within New
 
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is integrated into their
 
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
shift operating procedures Sops as well
 
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
as their Professional Standards of
 
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
conduct which is the pscs
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Stones I'd like to
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
speak to a second uh Mr cherry wood uh I
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
take very cautious leads in the language
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
I was included in this bill and that's
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
one of the main reasons I also concur
 
00:43:44.329 --> 00:43:44.339 align:start position:0%
100 with uh representative tenzar that
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
these issues are already addressed on
 
00:43:47.809 --> 00:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
many levels to include locals and state
 
00:43:47.819 --> 00:43:49.849 align:start position:0%
many levels to include locals and state
already

00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
somebody must want to talk
 
00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.349 align:start position:0%
somebody must want to talk
representative

00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
unless for federal agents and so to say
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to do this because
 
00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:13.859 align:start position:0%
it's covered by the federal government
 
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
um and therefore we can't have mirror
 
00:44:17.329 --> 00:44:17.339 align:start position:0%
bills seems to me like we're we're
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
biting both ends of the horse that's not
 
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
the right analogy I'm sorry but you'll
 
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
have to forgive my favorite brain please
 
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
leave the equine population out of it
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
and um but you know you got my point
 
00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
that we're we we can't say we're not
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
enforcing Federal things because that's
 
00:44:35.809 --> 00:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
up to other people and then we can't
 
00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
make mirror laws because we don't need
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
them because there's federal laws either
 
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
we're going to make mirror laws
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
or we're going to set up practices where
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
we can enforce federal laws but we can't
 
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
say we're not doing both that doesn't
 
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
seem appropriate
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't think you need to go
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
back to yesterday I think we just had
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
this discussion uh 10 minutes ago on the
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
previous bill so I think we find
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
ourselves all on different sides of
 
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
particular issues with regard to the
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
is isn't this help me out because I some
 
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
of these are starting to kind of Mumble
 
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
into a lot
 
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't this where we were having
 
00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:21.500 align:start position:0%
difficulty because the driver's license
 
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't say or doesn't have to say
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
that you know anything about race or
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
ethnicity I think that was one of the
 
00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:32.579 align:start position:0%
the kind of conundrums that we had and
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I have and I'm you
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
know I was writing real fast but I have
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
some kind of a note about page two and
 
00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
on line 20 that it was basically saying
 
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't be able to take the
 
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
person's criminal record or history into
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
account and if I'm remembering that the
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
testimony that was that was part of what
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
was said was that that has to be able to
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
be used
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
but again full disclosure I wrote really
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
fast so if anybody can help me I'm kind
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
of asking general questions to to this
 
00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.430 align:start position:0%
of asking general questions to to this
so

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you and that is exactly the point
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
of our executive session so that we can
 
00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
debate this does anyone want to respond
 
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
to those representative Murray
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the first part of what
 
00:46:17.809 --> 00:46:17.819 align:start position:0%
you said wasn't there a separate bill
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
that was talking about
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
um instituting a penalty for police
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
officers that misrepresented
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
um race and demographics and I think
 
00:46:26.099 --> 00:46:27.410 align:start position:0%
um race and demographics and I think
that's

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
um maybe what you're confusing that part
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
with I don't think it was in regards to
 
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:33.829 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
I I believe that the bill that you we
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
did have something like that but I think
 
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
the bill you're talking about is
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
actually in transportation where it was
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
saying that the person doesn't have to
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
say it and I think that was one of the
 
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
debates we were having was well if it
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
was actually required that would that
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
would solve a whole lot of of the
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
debates that we continuously have they
 
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
go around in circles
 
00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking that's part of the
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
reason why this is not able to be done
 
00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
not that anybody thinks that this is
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
okay let's make that very very clear
 
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
it is they're you know one hand your
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
hands tied and the other hand you're
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
kind of trying to untie it it's it was
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
it was just a lot of back and forth
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
confusion but I could be
 
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.890 align:start position:0%
confusion but I could be
mistaken

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
mistaken
 
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:16.910 align:start position:0%
mistaken
okay

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
um I think well with regard to this
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:23.579 align:start position:0%
it was my opinion that putting the
 
00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
police officers in a position where they
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
had to identify someone's race or
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
ethnicity or or gender
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
um was fraught with problems and the
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
question that was brought up is why can
 
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
it not be the person that
 
00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:38.099 align:start position:0%
self-identifies that way it's not
 
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon a police officer to
 
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.050 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon a police officer to
decide

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
um all of those things and then make a
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
report based on that it puts them in a
 
00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079 align:start position:0%
baptism we even heard testimony about
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
someone who was um
 
00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
who was misidentified their race and it
 
00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:56.579 align:start position:0%
puts the onus in the law enforcement
 
00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
when the what we're looking for is the
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
people to identify so that we can track
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement activity
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
um and I I just felt that that was uh
 
00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:08.339 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to put the law enforcement
 
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
in that position
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
someone wants to speak to that
 
00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
what I what I would like to do is is
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
remind people of the the primary purpose
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:23.579 align:start position:0%
um the primary purpose of the bill is to
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
make a clear policy statement that the
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
practice of racial profiling is
 
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
prohibited for law enforcement officers
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
um I do realize that during testimony
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
um there were some folks who did come
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
and objected to the second part of the
 
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
bill which gets to precisely uh the data
 
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
Gathering process used for racial
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
disparity and sentencing
 
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
um I believe and I'm I'm the prime
 
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill that probably the
 
00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:56.339 align:start position:0%
most important thing that we can achieve
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
today is is essentially making a clear
 
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
policy statement that no matter
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
what you feel about uh how
 
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
identification data should or should be
 
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.849 align:start position:0%
identification data should or should be
gathered

00:49:09.849 --> 00:49:09.859 align:start position:0%
gathered
 
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
we should make a clear statement that
 
00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
racial profiling is not acceptable in in
 
00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
and and I think one one thing that I
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
would suggest as an alternative is I
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
would be uh more than willing to uh drop
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
all of section two
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
um so we would actually have a clean
 
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
bill that really uh gives us an
 
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to decide whether or not
 
00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:40.970 align:start position:0%
opportunity to decide whether or not
um

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
prohibiting ratio profiling is something
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
that we want to do as a committee
 
00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.329 align:start position:0%
that we want to do as a committee
um

00:49:47.329 --> 00:49:47.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
so that would that would require uh a
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
recess of the current hearing a
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
withdrawal of the current motion uh I
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
would I could uh request LLS have that
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
Amendment and hopefully we would have it
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
by the end of this session
 
00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
meeting today
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
yes all right um representative Hill
 
00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
first you have a comment uh thank you Mr
 
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
chair um I sit as well on house
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
transportation and I think um uh Vice
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
chairs comments um
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
I guess is what I'm responding to the
 
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
the second the bill that we had and the
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
house just uh voted in expedient to
 
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
legislate on was
 
00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.089 align:start position:0%
legislate on was
um

00:50:31.089 --> 00:50:31.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
597. uh this is House Bill 596 we're
 
00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:38.099 align:start position:0%
talking about here but I think uh from
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
what I'm gathering and I'll be honest
 
00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
and saying I haven't read 596 I didn't
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
realize that was here
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
but um but representative Muse is is
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
correct that our problem was
 
00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.250 align:start position:0%
correct that our problem was
um

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
the seeming conundrum that we were
 
00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.049 align:start position:0%
the seeming conundrum that we were
asking

00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.049 --> 00:51:03.059 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
at a time that we were asking that we
 
00:51:10.569 --> 00:51:10.579 align:start position:0%
make a statement that that ethnicity
 
00:51:14.109 --> 00:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
is is bad
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
and then we were going to do something
 
00:51:20.329 --> 00:51:20.339 align:start position:0%
with that data that was um given up
 
00:51:20.339 --> 00:51:22.490 align:start position:0%
with that data that was um given up
voluntarily

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
and trying to um determine how to assess
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
that information that was given
 
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
voluntarily and make major decisions
 
00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:32.770 align:start position:0%
voluntarily and make major decisions
work

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:32.780 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
when we were saying that information or
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
bad data generally makes bad policy so
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
that was our purpose I'm not sure what
 
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
happens when we or if we followed
 
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
through with the idea of dropping part
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
two on this bill um
 
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
it would have been a different story I
 
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
think in transportation if we had
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
dropped part two but I'll leave that up
 
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
to the chair
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
um who made the motion
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
was it
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
would you be uh open to withdrawing your
 
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.230 align:start position:0%
would you be uh open to withdrawing your
motion

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:52:11.049 --> 00:52:11.059 align:start position:0%
so that representative Muse might
 
00:52:14.089 --> 00:52:14.099 align:start position:0%
produce an amendment for us to consider
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
yes I'll withdraw my motion and the
 
00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.630 align:start position:0%
yes I'll withdraw my motion and the
second

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
I'll withdraw thank you
 
00:52:23.329 --> 00:52:23.339 align:start position:0%
um having the emotions been withdrawn
 
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
I will we recess so that he can contact
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm going to do I I'm going
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
to recess this bill and representative
 
00:52:32.569 --> 00:52:32.579 align:start position:0%
Muse is going to get an amendment
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
dropping section two
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.719 --> 01:15:49.689 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:15:49.689 --> 01:15:49.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.699 --> 01:15:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
okay we're still waiting on an amendment
 
01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
for HB 596 so we're going to take up HP
 
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
400 at this point
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
yep and I will open the public hearing
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
and Hospital excuse me the executive
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
session Hospital 400 and recognize
 
01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
myself for a motion and I move ought to
 
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
pass do I hear a second second Mr chair
 
01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
second and I will speak to my motion
 
01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:20.219 align:start position:0%
House Bill 400 if you recall was the
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
bill making it a specific uh and
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
distinct offense for assault and battery
 
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
on a police officer
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
we heard through testimony that this is
 
01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
the only state in the entire country
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
that does not make it a separate offense
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
to assault the police officer currently
 
01:16:36.169 --> 01:16:36.179 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's the no different
 
01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
assaulting your neighbor than it is a
 
01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:39.500 align:start position:0%
police officer
 
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
we ask a lot of our police officers more
 
01:16:45.649 --> 01:16:45.659 align:start position:0%
and more every day we expect a lot we
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
hold them to a very high standard and I
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
think that the least we can do is give
 
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
them as much protection as we can and I
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
believe that assaulting a police officer
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
is not just an assault on an individual
 
01:16:59.450 --> 01:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
officer but it's an assault on our
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice System they are there
 
01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
representing the laws enforcing the laws
 
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
that we pass and when they assault the
 
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:08.940 align:start position:0%
police officer they are assaulting us
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
and they're assaulting the laws in the
 
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
whole system
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
and that alone should give it
 
01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.790 align:start position:0%
and that alone should give it
significant

01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.630 align:start position:0%
significant
um

01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
difference so that people understand the
 
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
seriousness and gravity of it the
 
01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
increase the difference in the penalties
 
01:17:27.169 --> 01:17:27.179 align:start position:0%
all I did was take the simple assault
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
which is currently and I increased all
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
the penalties one level for a police
 
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
officer so I didn't make it crazy it's
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
just one more level if you do that
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
and would you like to speak to the
 
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
second representative you wrapped it up
 
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
nicely thank you would anyone like to
 
01:17:45.649 --> 01:17:45.659 align:start position:0%
speak on this it's open for discussion
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative pru
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
well I'm glad to actually see
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
firefighters and EMS included in this
 
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
because unlike law enforcement we don't
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
have all the tools to defend ourselves
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
and uh actually I had one of the
 
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
firefighters EMTs that worked for me
 
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
get assaulted and almost had his nose
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
broken last week so
 
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
um too bad this isn't already in place
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
thanks well said and I I neglected to
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
mention that we did extend this to our
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
EMS workers who also we expect a lot
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
from especially in the recent years and
 
01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
to have them come in and risk their
 
01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.830 align:start position:0%
to have them come in and risk their
lives

01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
lives
 
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
doing the things they do especially
 
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
during the covet only to have them
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
literally slapped in the face for it I
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
think um Bears an additional penalty um
 
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
um I I absolutely agree with uh what you
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
said and and uh that they are acting in
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
the public public interest they're in
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
this position uh because they are acting
 
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
on behalf of us and
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I I would
 
01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
um agree and affirm I would hope that uh
 
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
just to add in I would hope that this
 
01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
would go along with uh body worn cameras
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
which I know are more and more prevalent
 
01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:01.820 align:start position:0%
in being used in different
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities and sheriffs and things
 
01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
like that so
 
01:19:07.729 --> 01:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just think as far as you know
 
01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:09.140 align:start position:0%
kind of the
 
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative Cameron thank you Mr
 
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
chairman I want to point out one thing I
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
noticed in the bill that I really like
 
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
and it's the law enforcement who has uh
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
officer has probable cause to believe a
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
person has violated this paragraph May
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
immediately arrest such person without a
 
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.250 align:start position:0%
immediately arrest such person without a
word

01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
and shall cause such person to be
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
brought before a judge
 
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
for determination of bill so they are
 
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
ineligible for a bill commissioner we've
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
been arguing about bail a lot and if
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
there's a violence against a police
 
01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
officer firefighter or EMS they have to
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
go before a judge for their bail hearing
 
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
I think that's a very positive thing
 
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
thank you and and the intent of this
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't to Tinker with the bail system
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
because that's a whole other um a whole
 
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
other can of worms but in in my opinion
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
in the opinion of the people I spoke to
 
01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
if you assault the police officer
 
01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
um that in my mind makes you definitely
 
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
a dangerous person because if you
 
01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
assault someone whose arm to the teeth
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
and representing the full force of the
 
01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
law what else are you are you capable of
 
01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
doing and I think that that should be up
 
01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:21.659 align:start position:0%
to a judge to decide
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
um what what happens to you based on the
 
01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances of that case
 
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
and as we were um as we discovered it's
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
possible in this state to be arrested in
 
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
one town and then later arrested in
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
another town in the new town not be
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
aware of your bail status or your um
 
01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
that you just assaulted a police officer
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
so until we can fix that uh significant
 
01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
loophole I think that that is
 
01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the discussion
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm uh I'm sympathetic with the
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill especially when it
 
01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
comes to giving some additional
 
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
protections to emergency service workers
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
who I think can use them
 
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I do have some concerns uh one of my
 
01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
concerns is this bill
 
01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.010 align:start position:0%
concerns is this bill
um

01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
does have an impact I think on our our
 
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
larger conversation about bail without
 
01:21:25.729 --> 01:21:25.739 align:start position:0%
uh at least as far as I can determine
 
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
without actually amending the bail
 
01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
statute itself
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
um my preference would would be to see
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
this bill uh and this bill retained
 
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
along with the other bills that uh that
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
touch on bail and things that
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
circumstances that impact the conditions
 
01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
of bail
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
I I also have uh some concerns in in
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
other areas I know that um an area where
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
that folks thought uh and you know
 
01:22:01.729 --> 01:22:01.739 align:start position:0%
problematic you know when it comes to
 
01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
school safety zones is you know how do
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you know what's a
 
01:22:08.689 --> 01:22:08.699 align:start position:0%
thousand feet you know do you have some
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
sort of GPS in your head and so there's
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
a language in here that basically
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
requires people where physically
 
01:22:15.719 --> 01:22:16.850 align:start position:0%
requires people where physically
possible

01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
um to remain at least 21 feet away from
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
the officer if warned so how do you know
 
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
exactly how far you are how does the
 
01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
officer In the Heat of the Moment know
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
exactly how far away he or she is
 
01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.070 align:start position:0%
exactly how far away he or she is
um

01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
so there are uh I think that there are
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
some issues that can be that can be
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
worked out
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
um I would prefer to to see them uh
 
01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
worked out rather than have the bill go
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
to the floor uh in the last the last
 
01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
issue is um you know right at the end of
 
01:22:53.689 --> 01:22:53.699 align:start position:0%
the bill a person is guilty of a class B
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
felony if he or she knowingly reports to
 
01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
a law enforcement officer or agency by
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
word or action false or baseless
 
01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
information regarding an allegation of
 
01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
misconduct by a law enforcement officer
 
01:23:08.649 --> 01:23:08.659 align:start position:0%
and I think I would agree that that
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
providing that information should be in
 
01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.630 align:start position:0%
providing that information should be in
offense

01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
offense
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
but a class B felony to go away for
 
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
three and a half years and and I would
 
01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
also remind folks of the other bill that
 
01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
we're considering at this time which is
 
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
redefining some of the circumstances of
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
police misconduct
 
01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
uh so a police under that bill a police
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
officer who knowingly files a false
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
report or misidentifies somebody would
 
01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
be subject to an administrative sanction
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
not a criminal penalty
 
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that we would be
 
01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
doing especially given the gravity of
 
01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
the penalty in this bill
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
um would be having one standard of
 
01:23:56.159 --> 01:23:57.169 align:start position:0%
um would be having one standard of
Justice

01:23:57.169 --> 01:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
for one type of person who violates the
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
law and a very very different standard
 
01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
of justice for somebody else who some
 
01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
could argue
 
01:24:09.530 --> 01:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
making a very similar offense
 
01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to point those things
 
01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.770 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to point those things
out

01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
um and uh and and hopefully kind of in
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
the spirit of some of the other things
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
we've been working together on we could
 
01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:20.699 align:start position:0%
work together on this to make it a
 
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
with regard to your objections to the
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
bill were the
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
the veil portion removed
 
01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:37.940 align:start position:0%
and a different wording to the 21 feet
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps something to the distance
 
01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
whatever distance the officer requests
 
01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
something along those lines so it's not
 
01:24:47.209 --> 01:24:47.219 align:start position:0%
as specific but it lets the officer set
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
um and the removing the felony turning
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
it to a a plane misdemeanor would that
 
01:25:00.649 --> 01:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
that would work much better better for
 
01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
me there may be other members of the
 
01:25:05.689 --> 01:25:05.699 align:start position:0%
committee who may have additional input
 
01:25:05.699 --> 01:25:08.270 align:start position:0%
committee who may have additional input
but

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.370 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
so on the 21 feet that used to be the
 
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
old standard for anyone with a knife
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't pull out your gun and shoot him
 
01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
before they stabbed you it's now been
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
moved to 31 feet so they do know exactly
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
where 21 feet is
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
um and this isn't really about bail this
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
is about assaulting a police officer a
 
01:25:30.649 --> 01:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
firefighter or EMT public servants that
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
are there working for you
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
so they have a little extra protection
 
01:25:38.209 --> 01:25:38.219 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
yup if you if you're assaulting a police
 
01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:41.630 align:start position:0%
yup if you if you're assaulting a police
officer

01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:25:43.729 --> 01:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
you're obviously are willing to pretty
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
much assault anyone so yeah I'm kind of
 
01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
okay with Nobel at the moment and it has
 
01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
to go before a judge instead of just the
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh the regular route
 
01:25:54.239 --> 01:25:55.729 align:start position:0%
uh the regular route
so

01:25:55.729 --> 01:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm good with this bill
 
01:25:59.570 --> 01:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Reed
 
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
regarding the decreasing the penalty for
 
01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
um filing uh you know false information
 
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
I think a felony is is quite appropriate
 
01:26:10.910 --> 01:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I think that a strong message needs
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
to go out that you can't lie
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
in a report against a first responder or
 
01:26:19.129 --> 01:26:19.139 align:start position:0%
a police officer because you could walk
 
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
away but this is going to follow the
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
police officer or the first responder
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
and um no matter how often you know it's
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
dismissed as you know false allegations
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
that's that's still there so I think a
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
felony is is completely appropriate for
 
01:26:34.679 --> 01:26:37.310 align:start position:0%
felony is is completely appropriate for
misinformation

01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt
 
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
anybody that reads the union leader
 
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
knows how that turned out recently
 
01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
police officers assaulted and right
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
afterwards the person uh stabbed
 
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
somebody to death so this right here
 
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
would have slowed that one case down and
 
01:26:54.649 --> 01:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
those kind of things that happening all
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
the time in New Hampshire unfortunately
 
01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
now as it has across the country
 
01:26:59.930 --> 01:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
I'm totally in favor of this build the
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
way it sits right now thank you
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
um I do have to agree with
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
representative news on a lot of the
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
points he brought up I honestly just
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
think this is a lot to tackle in one
 
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
bill and they're just small adjustments
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
like the ones you mentioned earlier that
 
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
can make it more amenable
 
01:27:22.129 --> 01:27:22.139 align:start position:0%
um you know I do agree that it should be
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
like we should be discouraging people
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
from assaulting police officers and
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
other Public Service workers of course I
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
do think it's hard to make changes
 
01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
regarding bail eligibility considering
 
01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
the committee's path on retaining all
 
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
other bills to make sure they all
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
coordinate and work together and make
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
sense together instead of just pulling
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
out this one thing and changing it and
 
01:27:48.649 --> 01:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
in regards to making the false report I
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
do have to say I think we just need to
 
01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:53.219 align:start position:0%
really weigh carefully the impact of
 
01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
felony charge can have on an
 
01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
individual's life you know during
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
testimony Chief by fonsi I believe from
 
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
Bedford Police you know shared an
 
01:28:03.169 --> 01:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
example of like say a police officer
 
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
pulls over a mom and her kids and she
 
01:28:06.649 --> 01:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
gets stressed and frustrated and you
 
01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
know says that he yelled at her and then
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing the body cam footage you know
 
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
she wasn't he wasn't yelling at her and
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
now that Mom could go to prison
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
um with felony charge and I just think
 
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
that is such a huge like reaction
 
01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
um to something that especially if the
 
01:28:28.129 --> 01:28:28.139 align:start position:0%
officers found not guilty you know what
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
impacted it
 
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
it does the impact really
 
01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:32.810 align:start position:0%
it does the impact really
um

01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
equal to the punishment and when we make
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
felons of people we're making criminals
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
of otherwise law abiding citizens I
 
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
think we just really need to wait
 
01:28:45.649 --> 01:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
carefully does the punishment really
 
01:28:45.659 --> 01:28:47.090 align:start position:0%
carefully does the punishment really
match

01:28:47.090 --> 01:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
match
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Manion
 
01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I do have notes here
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
and that was a concern of mine uh and I
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
think what I
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
got from it was a separation of criminal
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
allegations versus misconduct certainly
 
01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
if somebody came to the station and said
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
that I you know she she swore at me and
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
or I swore at her and I didn't that
 
01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be A B felony but if she
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
accused me of a criminal act where I can
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
go to jail for and lose my job that's a
 
01:29:22.850 --> 01:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
little different so perhaps a separation
 
01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:24.470 align:start position:0%
little different so perhaps a separation
between

01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
General misconduct versus a criminal
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
allegation that might
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
that would satisfy my my position on it
 
01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for the discussion
 
01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:36.950 align:start position:0%
thank you for the discussion
representative

01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.450 align:start position:0%
representative
um salik

01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
um salik
 
01:29:40.729 --> 01:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to say that I
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
agreed with with what representative
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
Muse was saying I feel like both in the
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
spirit of where we're looking at the
 
01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
other bail bills differently that
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
element of this
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
poses some challenges for me and and the
 
01:29:55.850 --> 01:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
level as representative Murray said you
 
01:29:59.330 --> 01:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
know a distressed mom who makes a
 
01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:00.900 align:start position:0%
statement out of fear and and
 
01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:02.510 align:start position:0%
statement out of fear and and
frustration

01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
frustration
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately potentially losing custody of
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
her children
 
01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.090 align:start position:0%
her children
um it

01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
um it
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's disproportionate and if we're going
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
to hold civilians up to these standards
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
then when we're passing bills about
 
01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
actual police misconduct there should be
 
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to point out
 
01:30:25.970 --> 01:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
to the committee that uh if they're not
 
01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
aware in New Hampshire RSA 5945 all
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
individuals have a duty to submit to
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
arrest in this state
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
in itself even if you believe that
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
arrest to be illegal
 
01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
I'm sure everybody's aware of that or
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
not a follow-up also on that if you
 
01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
indulge me is that I would respectfully
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
disagree with representative Muse I
 
01:30:46.970 --> 01:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
think uh a lot of people don't
 
01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
understand the impact of false
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
allegations and false reports to law
 
01:30:51.649 --> 01:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
enforcement can be career ending and
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
life uh changing that's not recoverable
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
thanks um
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
I feel like the mics are super loud
 
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:07.189 align:start position:0%
I feel like the mics are super loud
today

01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:31:07.199 --> 01:31:08.030 align:start position:0%
today
um

01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
I um I wanted to reflect on I guess my
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts after hearing uh representative
 
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
Murray's um input
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
another consideration isn't just the
 
01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
fairness of the punishment versus the
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
the crime but also the extrapolated
 
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.139 align:start position:0%
impacts system-wide on the consequences
 
01:31:29.689 --> 01:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
of that type of punishment because if
 
01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
you are talking about a single parent or
 
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
you know just a parent in general who
 
01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:35.810 align:start position:0%
you know just a parent in general who
has

01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
um dependence then with a felony record
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
that person is going to end up
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
on the Welter system and I know that in
 
01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
other aspects of law that is a common
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
consideration is you know for example in
 
01:31:50.689 --> 01:31:50.699 align:start position:0%
the family court system
 
01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
if um the judge is considering one
 
01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
decision or another they will take into
 
01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
consideration whether
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know limiting contact or something
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
with the children or something will
 
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
result in a parent ending up as part of
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
the welfare system
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that's a valid
 
01:32:12.410 --> 01:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
consideration but as far as the
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
structure of the bill I know that a few
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
years ago I want to say
 
01:32:18.169 --> 01:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
maybe 2016 or something there was a bill
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
in the Senate from
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
Donna soucy to specifically reclassify
 
01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
and pull out domestic violence versus
 
01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
other types of
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
um you know assault criminal activity
 
01:32:35.689 --> 01:32:35.699 align:start position:0%
because evidently an issue that she
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
realized after a terrible incident in
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester was that there were people
 
01:32:42.169 --> 01:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
with criminal records where they if
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
specifically for domestic violence but
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
because of how it was classified under
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
the law it could easily be chalked up to
 
01:32:51.410 --> 01:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
like a bar fight and that that
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
distinction was necessary in the law to
 
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:54.970 align:start position:0%
distinction was necessary in the law to
enable

01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:54.980 align:start position:0%
enable
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
particularly people participating in the
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
family court system or dcif to be
 
01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:00.900 align:start position:0%
evaluated accurately so that could be
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
another direction to go with the intent
 
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily to change penalties
 
01:33:09.649 --> 01:33:09.659 align:start position:0%
but to create a distinction in the law
 
01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
the difference between assault and
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
assault on a public official
 
01:33:18.729 --> 01:33:18.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler I just want to
 
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
add on my support to a retention motion
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
I think this is a really good piece of
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'm conflicted on how
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'll vote for it I think ultimately if
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion comes before us I
 
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
might vote for it but I do agree with
 
01:33:37.450 --> 01:33:37.460 align:start position:0%
representative manion's points about
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
clarifying between General misconduct
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
and uh uh
 
01:33:45.290 --> 01:33:45.300 align:start position:0%
forgetting the term criminal criminal
 
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
allegations against a police officer I
 
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
think that would be a good distinction
 
01:33:51.890 --> 01:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
to make and uh would satisfy some of
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
those concerns of other people on the
 
01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.550 align:start position:0%
those concerns of other people on the
committee

01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:33:56.209 --> 01:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:56.219 --> 01:33:57.229 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
based on the testimony based on the
 
01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
discussion I um I'm going to I'm going
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
to recess this bill and get an amendment
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
and see if we can't meet halfway on some
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
of these issues that are reasonable and
 
01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
do make good points any other discussion
 
01:34:14.410 --> 01:34:14.420 align:start position:0%
before I do that
 
01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
representative Peru
 
01:34:17.219 --> 01:34:18.410 align:start position:0%
representative Peru
so

01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:20.450 --> 01:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
on that last piece
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
if somebody makes an accusation against
 
01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:23.689 align:start position:0%
if somebody makes an accusation against
me

01:34:23.689 --> 01:34:23.699 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
I'm in the back of the ambulance and
 
01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
somebody says I touched her
 
01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
inappropriately I'm going to be
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
suspended more than likely I'll be fired
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
in a very short time before this even
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
really gets investigated very well and
 
01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's proven to be a false allegation and
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
how would I do that there are no cameras
 
01:34:40.129 --> 01:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
in the back of the ambulance so I may
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
lose my career
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
my income
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
and then I'll be on the welfare system
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh I definitely I definitely agree and I
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
think that and and that follows you and
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
I will tell you in New Hampshire
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
Fire EMS and police is a very small
 
01:34:57.239 --> 01:34:58.010 align:start position:0%
Fire EMS and police is a very small
world

01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
I can be the greatest guy in the world
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
nobody hears about me I make one mistake
 
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
everybody in the system knows about it
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
and I will never get hired again and I
 
01:35:08.450 --> 01:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
probably won't even get hired in another
 
01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:10.610 align:start position:0%
probably won't even get hired in another
state

01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:35:13.129 --> 01:35:13.139 align:start position:0%
yeah and I also um I think that would
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
probably cause that accusation could
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
cause an officer to be put on the lawyer
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
list before he ever has a chance to
 
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
defend it uh representative Reed thank
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and another point to
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
consider is oftentimes municipalities or
 
01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
towns will settle outside of court on
 
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
complaints just to get rid of it so
 
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's no resolution for the for the
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
police officers or First Responders and
 
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
they're left with this claim this false
 
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
claim and um the towns you know or
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities just want it gone so
 
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
that's another point to consider thank
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much
 
01:35:45.719 --> 01:35:46.550 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much
um okay

01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to recess the the hearing
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me the session on this and um
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
discussed a little bit and we'll be
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
taking care of it today
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
no because it's you know I'm just gonna
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
get him an amendment
 
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
um next we have representative Muse did
 
01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
okay we will then
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
um at this point I will open the
 
01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
executive session again on House Bill
 
01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:16.250 align:start position:0%
executive session again on House Bill
596.

01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
596.
 
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:24.290 align:start position:0%
 
everything

01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think we all have
 
01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:48.659 align:start position:0%
uh we have copies of the amendment now
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
um what the amendment uh effectively
 
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
does is it removes uh sections two and
 
01:37:55.850 --> 01:37:55.860 align:start position:0%
three of the bill
 
01:37:58.850 --> 01:37:58.860 align:start position:0%
um uh sections two and three of the bill
 
01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:00.310 align:start position:0%
um uh sections two and three of the bill
uh

01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
effectively uh address the uh the issue
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
of racial disparities in sentencing in
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there were some Provisions
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
around data Gathering
 
01:38:15.169 --> 01:38:15.179 align:start position:0%
um it is where the bulk of cost for the
 
01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note uh would would come from uh
 
01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
and perhaps all the costs of the fiscal
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
note I need to take to take a coast a
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
closer look at that but what it leaves
 
01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
us with is is a clean bill that would
 
01:38:30.169 --> 01:38:30.179 align:start position:0%
prohibit racial profiling in New
 
01:38:30.179 --> 01:38:32.030 align:start position:0%
prohibit racial profiling in New
Hampshire

01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
um this is something uh that's bothered
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
me for a couple of years
 
01:38:39.050 --> 01:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
um as a member of this committee and I
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
think all of the members of this
 
01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
committee when the liac commission was
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
actually in session we we all followed
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
it very closely because we know we knew
 
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh in particular the legislative
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
recommendations were going to come here
 
01:38:52.669 --> 01:38:52.679 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I think that
 
01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
surprised me and surprised some of the
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
other folks on the committee was that
 
01:38:59.570 --> 01:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
um the recommendations around racial
 
01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
profiling really seem to focus solely on
 
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
things like identification issues and
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and it just seemed
 
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
like we never got to to a point where we
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
remembered that oh yeah maybe in statute
 
01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
we should prohibit racial profiling
 
01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
um so uh what I would say is this is
 
01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
really a policy statement there are no
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
penalties that are prescribed I think
 
01:39:32.590 --> 01:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
that if a if an officer is uh uh is uh
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh brought up before police standards
 
01:39:37.490 --> 01:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
and training around the issue of of of
 
01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
racial profiling
 
01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
um police standards and training has a
 
01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
as a process that they would use to turn
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not uh the
 
01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
officer would uh be suspended keep their
 
01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
certification lose their certification
 
01:39:55.970 --> 01:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
but I think one of the things that is is
 
01:39:58.669 --> 01:39:58.679 align:start position:0%
important here is just sending a strong
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
message not only to to law enforcement
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
but also to members of our
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
our minority communities here in New
 
01:40:11.209 --> 01:40:11.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
um that racial profiling is not
 
01:40:18.169 --> 01:40:18.179 align:start position:0%
acceptable uh in this state and
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know in many respects you know New
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is is firing on on all
 
01:40:23.159 --> 01:40:24.350 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is is firing on on all
cylinders

01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
cylinders
 
01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
um I think we could add a cylinder if we
 
01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
if we pass a bill a bill like this
 
01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
um that just sends a a very clear
 
01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:34.739 align:start position:0%
message to everybody about what is
 
01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
acceptable and what is not acceptable in
 
01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:44.090 --> 01:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you I do believe though we we
 
01:40:45.890 --> 01:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
do need emotion on the floor
 
01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
um I don't recall did you move at this
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
moment this amendment I I
 
01:40:56.530 --> 01:40:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
2023-0596 uh ought to pass and seconded
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
by representative Staley is that why
 
01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
you're okay
 
01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:04.980 align:start position:0%

01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:06.060 align:start position:0%

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:08.010 align:start position:0%
representative sailing
 
01:41:08.010 --> 01:41:15.350 align:start position:0%
representative sailing
[Music]

01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
Global Society is learning to recognize
 
01:41:19.729 --> 01:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
our own
 
01:41:21.649 --> 01:41:21.659 align:start position:0%
um our own bias whether we're aware of
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
it or not and my hope is that by putting
 
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
language like this into policy that it
 
01:41:30.590 --> 01:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
will encourage not just training within
 
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:32.699 align:start position:0%
the academy
 
01:41:35.209 --> 01:41:35.219 align:start position:0%
um training academies but also ongoing
 
01:41:37.490 --> 01:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
training so that we can all work
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
collaboratively to make the world better
 
01:41:41.570 --> 01:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
for all of us
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.649 --> 01:41:57.659 align:start position:0%
so I believe everything following line
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
well actually everything after the first
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
page after line 30 on the first page
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
everything is removed is that correct
 
01:42:04.729 --> 01:42:04.739 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the numbered version of
 
01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:08.149 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the numbered version of
it

01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
um but it wouldn't it would uh it
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
removes everything but the effective
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
date after
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
the part that says it's numeral two new
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
section sentences racial disparity and
 
01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
sentencing prohibited it removes that
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
entire section it removes uh section
 
01:42:29.090 --> 01:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
three involving
 
01:42:31.609 --> 01:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
um the requirement for the county uh the
 
01:42:33.729 --> 01:42:33.739 align:start position:0%
counties to provide data in this area
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
and it would uh it would essentially
 
01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
make the effective date section too
 
01:42:42.609 --> 01:42:42.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:44.940 align:start position:0%

01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
okay at that point I would ask the clerk

stories like The Tyree nickel story uh
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
bothered everybody during during the

01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
um I I think I think one of the one of
 
01:44:49.129 --> 01:44:49.139 align:start position:0%
the areas where everybody who testified
 
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
really did seem to agree was that this
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
particular move is one that New
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire really needs to make there
 
01:45:01.010 --> 01:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
were no objections from law enforcement
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh to this part of the bill I think law
 
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
enforcement is on board with this too uh
 
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
and uh and I hope we can be on board
 
01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
with it as well as a committee thank you
 
01:45:14.209 --> 01:45:14.219 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you I I do have
 
01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
reservations about this bill
 
01:45:21.370 --> 01:45:21.380 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we can legislate away
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh bias or bad behavior and I I do think
 
01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:26.090 align:start position:0%
uh bias or bad behavior and I I do think
that

01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:26.689 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:45:26.689 --> 01:45:26.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh the issue of race has been one that's
 
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
so pervasive and so deep rooted in the
 
01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:34.679 align:start position:0%
society that I'm not sure will uh one
 
01:45:37.729 --> 01:45:37.739 align:start position:0%
bill or any bill will be able to to have
 
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
those conversations and get those
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
feelings out of some people I think it
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
starts more with conversations and
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
connections that being said I think I
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
will Vote for This legislation because I
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
I do agree with representative Muse that
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
making this statement that we do not
 
01:45:55.850 --> 01:45:55.860 align:start position:0%
support racial profiling as a state uh
 
01:45:58.729 --> 01:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial to starting that
 
01:46:02.209 --> 01:46:02.219 align:start position:0%
conversation that's needed so I'm gonna
 
01:46:02.219 --> 01:46:04.070 align:start position:0%
conversation that's needed so I'm gonna
vote

01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
against an ideal motion or four or not
 
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
um I I have some reservations
 
01:46:18.169 --> 01:46:18.179 align:start position:0%
um with regard to this because what what
 
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
what happens then
 
01:46:21.649 --> 01:46:21.659 align:start position:0%
in other words if uh if a law
 
01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer I mean what is that
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
what is the standard to which law
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer will be held for
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
example by their agency or or for their
 
01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:32.510 align:start position:0%
example by their agency or or for their
certification

01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:33.609 align:start position:0%
certification
um

01:46:33.609 --> 01:46:33.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
what is it like in other words how many
 
01:46:38.209 --> 01:46:38.219 align:start position:0%
how many stops of someone of A different
 
01:46:41.050 --> 01:46:41.060 align:start position:0%
race does it take before their their
 
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
ramifications what what there needs to
 
01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
be a quantifiable something to say that
 
01:46:49.850 --> 01:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
this person has violated this and I'm
 
01:46:52.850 --> 01:46:52.860 align:start position:0%
concerned that it's so broad with no no
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism to
 
01:46:58.010 --> 01:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
to measure it by that it could be used
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
against Law Enforcement Officers when
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
there really is no racial bias
 
01:47:05.810 --> 01:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
but they maybe just
 
01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
want to use it against them to get rid
 
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
of them I don't I don't
 
01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about its vagueness with
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
regard to what the effect would be on a
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer any further
 
01:47:16.850 --> 01:47:16.860 align:start position:0%
discussion on that point representative
 
01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:17.810 align:start position:0%
discussion on that point representative
Pro

01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
Pro
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
so I'm not a police officer and and
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
you know do I play one on TV but
 
01:47:24.119 --> 01:47:24.950 align:start position:0%
you know do I play one on TV but
um

01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:27.890 --> 01:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure how you
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
enforce this and determine
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
what was going through that officer's
 
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
head when the interaction happened did
 
01:47:40.609 --> 01:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
it happen because of racial profiling or
 
01:47:42.649 --> 01:47:42.659 align:start position:0%
was there something else that he saw
 
01:47:42.659 --> 01:47:43.790 align:start position:0%
was there something else that he saw
that

01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
fell into a category to make a stop or
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
and now everybody says well
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
was that racial profiling
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
well no I saw him cross the line so I
 
01:47:58.129 --> 01:47:58.139 align:start position:0%
stopped him or whatever the case may be
 
01:48:03.050 --> 01:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.689 --> 01:48:05.699 align:start position:0%
if they happen to be three people of
 
01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
color in a row
 
01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
that did that now is he racial profiling
 
01:48:12.290 --> 01:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
or was he just in the right spot at the
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
right time to see this happen
 
01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
so it could affect the officer
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
when he's not really doing that
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I agree it's very vague and I get
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
the statement absolutely
 
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
I am 100 against racial profiling or any
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:48:35.930 --> 01:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
but uh how do you enforce it how do you
 
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
prove it how do you get in somebody's
 
01:48:40.609 --> 01:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
mind and say what were you thinking
 
01:48:43.609 --> 01:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
so to me
 
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
too many unanswered questions for me
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and and I I were this a um
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution to say you know we
 
01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
the legislature think that racial
 
01:48:58.609 --> 01:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
profiling is abhorrent and expected not
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
to be conducted in the state of New
 
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would be voting for it five
 
01:49:06.169 --> 01:49:06.179 align:start position:0%
times in a row but this seems to create
 
01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
a situation in my mind where an officer
 
01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
could be accused of something by
 
01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
somebody and there's no quantifiable
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
standard to hold them to and that's
 
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
concerning representative Manion
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh well nobody agrees
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
racial profiling is good and uh
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that in my career
 
01:49:26.330 --> 01:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
I've been I've stopped someone and
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
they've said just stop me because of my
 
01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:28.850 align:start position:0%
they've said just stop me because of my
race

01:49:28.850 --> 01:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
race
 
01:49:31.490 --> 01:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
and you know it could be 10 o'clock at
 
01:49:33.410 --> 01:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
night we're going I'm going 40 he's
 
01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
going 70. there's absolutely no way I
 
01:49:37.129 --> 01:49:37.139 align:start position:0%
would know that but if he makes a
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
complaint against me
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
where does this bill come into play does
 
01:49:43.129 --> 01:49:43.139 align:start position:0%
my department use it does you know
 
01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
police standings and training use it can
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
I be sued civilly because now it's a law
 
01:49:49.010 --> 01:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
and who's going to determine whether or
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
not that was a racial profiling issue or
 
01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
was it just because he was speeding so I
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
just think it's it's a little bit too
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
broad I have no problem with making a
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
policy statement or a proclamation uh
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
certainly we are all in agreement that
 
01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
racial profiling is not how we conduct
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
business in this state
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
um but it leaves it open to police
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
officers being uh penalized even if it's
 
01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
not criminally
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
um as a result there is an attorney
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
general review on this
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
are they going to make a determination I
 
01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
it makes me nervous thank you
 
01:50:27.169 --> 01:50:27.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for the discussion
 
01:50:31.729 --> 01:50:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:34.010 --> 01:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
I would say that you know one of the
 
01:50:35.689 --> 01:50:35.699 align:start position:0%
reasons why we have so much difficulty
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
with this issue is racial profiling is
 
01:50:41.330 --> 01:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
so difficult to prove it's one of the
 
01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
reasons why we have all the ongoing
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
conversations around how people should
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
be identified whether we should change
 
01:50:51.649 --> 01:50:51.659 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and things like that
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
um there there are times and I think
 
01:50:55.729 --> 01:50:55.739 align:start position:0%
there have been times in in the history
 
01:50:57.950 --> 01:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
of of this state and the history of
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
others where
 
01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
um even without identifying somebody
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
from a driver's license or an
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
identification method
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
there is a clear pattern of profiling on
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
the part of some officers that can be
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
determined through things like multiple
 
01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
complaints that are found to be to to
 
01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
basically be true
 
01:51:22.729 --> 01:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
I am not saying it is easy and I'm also
 
01:51:25.250 --> 01:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
not saying that it wouldn't be helpful
 
01:51:27.590 --> 01:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
to further Define
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
to you know to to you know to Define
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
what constitutes it
 
01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
um I think the definition that we have
 
01:51:39.850 --> 01:51:39.860 align:start position:0%
uh in this in this particular Bill
 
01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
encompasses a behavior that we're trying
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
to discourage here in New Hampshire
 
01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:47.890 align:start position:0%
to discourage here in New Hampshire
um again

01:51:47.890 --> 01:51:47.900 align:start position:0%
um again
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
the I think the intention of the bill is
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
to make a policy statement that uh that
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
the police academy police standards and
 
01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:00.050 align:start position:0%
the police academy police standards and
training

01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
um can use as part of the communication
 
01:52:04.729 --> 01:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
that they do with officers as part of
 
01:52:07.490 --> 01:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
their review of accusations of you know
 
01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
of misconduct
 
01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
and I think this is an area where you
 
01:52:14.689 --> 01:52:14.699 align:start position:0%
have to start somewhere and I think
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's really what this bill is
 
01:52:19.609 --> 01:52:19.619 align:start position:0%
attempting to try to do it's to give us
 
01:52:21.770 --> 01:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
a starting point
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
um uh and uh and there and I would be
 
01:52:26.689 --> 01:52:26.699 align:start position:0%
the first to agree that we're not done
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
yet I think Governor sununu when at the
 
01:52:31.810 --> 01:52:31.820 align:start position:0%
end of the work of the liac commission
 
01:52:34.850 --> 01:52:34.860 align:start position:0%
basically said the same thing this is
 
01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
just the start we have we still have a
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
lot of work to do we have a ways to go
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
before we're there
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that this bill is part of
 
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
the Journey of of getting us there and I
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
would hope that
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
um we can be we can continue to be on
 
01:52:53.689 --> 01:52:53.699 align:start position:0%
that journey and to take steps on that
 
01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
journey in the second year of this
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
session uh but this bill does give us a
 
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
place to start and I would
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
um I would hope people can support it
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the discussion
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you Mr
 
01:53:10.129 --> 01:53:10.139 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't think it's the role of
 
01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
this committee to make statements I
 
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
think we are here to make solid and just
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
policies having said that there is no
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
provision in this bill either for
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
officers or First Responders who work
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
primarily in cities with higher
 
01:53:29.090 --> 01:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
densities of immigrant or minority
 
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
populations versus somebody who works in
 
01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
the White Mountains how are you gonna
 
01:53:35.689 --> 01:53:35.699 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
um protect you know they're going to
 
01:53:40.729 --> 01:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
have more inter interface how are you
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
gonna how are you gonna you know tease
 
01:53:46.490 --> 01:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
that out so that that doesn't come up as
 
01:53:49.609 --> 01:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
you know having more complaints but it's
 
01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
just the demographic of where they
 
01:53:54.649 --> 01:53:54.659 align:start position:0%
Patrol or the area they service
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:58.729 --> 01:53:58.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for the discussion
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
01:54:01.490 --> 01:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think this bill
 
01:54:03.649 --> 01:54:03.659 align:start position:0%
clearly has very good intentions but I
 
01:54:04.729 --> 01:54:04.739 align:start position:0%
don't think it's ready for prime time
 
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
yet in my opinion and I'll be supporting
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
an I.T alumnus
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray
 
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
um I definitely hear the concerns on
 
01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
both sides of the committee I you know
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
frankly don't think this bill will like
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
change things you know it seems like
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
represented when you said more of a
 
01:54:25.609 --> 01:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
policy statement
 
01:54:27.649 --> 01:54:27.659 align:start position:0%
um and you know I struggled to see
 
01:54:30.649 --> 01:54:30.659 align:start position:0%
departments using this as a way to
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
punish their officers especially
 
01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
considering the struggle they are having
 
01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
in hiring officers right now
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
um but I also wanted to remind the
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
committee of last session
 
01:54:43.729 --> 01:54:43.739 align:start position:0%
um a similar bill was passed that
 
01:54:43.739 --> 01:54:44.870 align:start position:0%
um a similar bill was passed that
protected

01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
protected
 
01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
um bikers from profiling um from law
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement and it had similar language
 
01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
you know it's a another car about we did
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
to protect a class of people that also
 
01:54:57.850 --> 01:54:57.860 align:start position:0%
didn't have you know specific
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
specificities and how it would get
 
01:55:04.129 --> 01:55:04.139 align:start position:0%
enacted and how officers would be
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
um held accountable to that um
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
policy statement so I just wanted to say
 
01:55:11.209 --> 01:55:11.219 align:start position:0%
that there is precedent for similar
 
01:55:11.219 --> 01:55:12.530 align:start position:0%
that there is precedent for similar
legislation

01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
um even if this one seems incomplete at
 
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
this time maybe it is a good first step
 
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
in the right direction thank you
 
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the the legislation
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
you just brought up if I recall that was
 
01:55:30.649 --> 01:55:30.659 align:start position:0%
um a small paragraph Was it not
 
01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative amanian
 
01:55:35.689 --> 01:55:35.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair not to drag this on
 
01:55:37.970 --> 01:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
anymore but I'm hearing policy statement
 
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
and uh but
 
01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative Muse last testimony he
 
01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
said this would be used
 
01:55:48.050 --> 01:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
to identify offices and it would also be
 
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
used for police standings and training
 
01:55:52.609 --> 01:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
for certification purposes those were
 
01:55:55.129 --> 01:55:55.139 align:start position:0%
his own words so that's my concern thank
 
01:55:55.139 --> 01:55:56.450 align:start position:0%
his own words so that's my concern thank
you

01:55:56.450 --> 01:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:56:01.609 --> 01:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.619 --> 01:56:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
I um just would would Echo what I was
 
01:56:11.450 --> 01:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
saying before which is
 
01:56:13.970 --> 01:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
if we have a statement of policy like
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
this where if we do have an officer who
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
unknowingly continues to racially
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
profile people because I think I I think
 
01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
that the majority of things that happen
 
01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
are potentially happening based on
 
01:56:31.370 --> 01:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
people's unconscious biases and we're
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
then able to say you know we've received
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
multiple complaints let's have you do
 
01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
some training to recognize what's going
 
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
on so that we can help your behavior so
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
that you're doing a better job
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
protecting the public rather than
 
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
focusing on a specific group of people I
 
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
don't think that the intent of this bill
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
um be about punishment it's about
 
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
raising awareness it's about raising
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
standards and it's about increasing
 
01:57:03.410 --> 01:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.530 --> 01:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you and that is well taken however
 
01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
it will be used
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
um in the other way because of the fact
 
01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
that it it puts a it puts a um an onus
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
on a police officer not to do a certain
 
01:57:19.129 --> 01:57:19.139 align:start position:0%
thing but the certain thing isn't
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily Quantified and it doesn't
 
01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
say who will be the judge of that and I
 
01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
think it it opens them to Serious
 
01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:27.709 align:start position:0%
think it it opens them to Serious
um

01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:31.129 --> 01:57:31.139 align:start position:0%
serious danger with their careers I
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
would agree with it as I said if it were
 
01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
just a policy statement and we wanted to
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
issue a resolution saying that we
 
01:57:39.239 --> 01:57:40.129 align:start position:0%
issue a resolution saying that we
um

01:57:40.129 --> 01:57:40.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
would not tolerate this in the state
 
01:57:44.209 --> 01:57:44.219 align:start position:0%
would be different than actually making
 
01:57:45.890 --> 01:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
a law with an attorney general review
 
01:57:48.410 --> 01:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
process representative Peru you had a
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
comment I know it's been a while but uh
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:57.599 --> 01:58:00.410 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
I wanted to just tell a a quick story
 
01:58:10.490 --> 01:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
that may help I I have another bill uh
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
that went before child and family law
 
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
passed 16 to nothing we had the
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
executive session immediately after the
 
01:58:19.070 --> 01:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
hearing the bill was on Banning the use
 
01:58:21.770 --> 01:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
of prone restraint on children in New
 
01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:22.850 align:start position:0%
of prone restraint on children in New
Hampshire

01:58:22.850 --> 01:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that was pointed
 
01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
out to me is in the statute if you
 
01:58:29.890 --> 01:58:29.900 align:start position:0%
actually read the wording of the statute
 
01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:32.580 align:start position:0%
a reasonable person reading the statute
 
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
could could conclude that prone
 
01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
restraint is actually already banned
 
01:58:40.010 --> 01:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
problem that we were having is that
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
there were there were some New Hampshire
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
Child Care Facilities who were looking
 
01:58:46.609 --> 01:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
at that and saying I don't see prone
 
01:58:48.530 --> 01:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
restraint and I think that there's a
 
01:58:50.450 --> 01:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
safe way to do prone restraint and and
 
01:58:52.850 --> 01:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is is
 
01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:53.629 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is is
um

01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:53.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:55.609 --> 01:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
very difficult to do prone restraint
 
01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
safely when you're a 200 pound adult and
 
01:59:00.430 --> 01:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
the child weighs 100 pounds
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
so what what I think we all agreed to
 
01:59:07.129 --> 01:59:07.139 align:start position:0%
was that a policy clarification where we
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
specifically called out prone restraint
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
in the statute and we defined it as we
 
01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
did here it's actually very helpful from
 
01:59:19.609 --> 01:59:19.619 align:start position:0%
a policy import enforcement perspective
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a related story but I
 
01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
think what it can do is it can show you
 
01:59:27.770 --> 01:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
the value of of doing something like
 
01:59:30.770 --> 01:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
what's in front of us today
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:34.129 --> 01:59:34.139 align:start position:0%
um I think we've had a robust and
 
01:59:36.589 --> 01:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
healthy debate and I will ask the clerk
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
to call the role on the motion is ought
 
01:59:42.109 --> 01:59:42.119 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair I would
 
02:00:57.609 --> 02:00:57.619 align:start position:0%
I think we've had a very good discussion
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
like I said when my point is I think
 
02:01:01.729 --> 02:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
this bill has very good intentions I
 
02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
just think it's not ready for prime time
 
02:01:04.669 --> 02:01:04.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of unanswered questions I
 
02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
think the reality base is that you have
 
02:01:08.089 --> 02:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
a department that's responsible for
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
their officers that's your first level
 
02:01:12.589 --> 02:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
it goes to pts excuse me uh police
 
02:01:14.930 --> 02:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
station training Council I can go up to
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
the federal level and go up to the state
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
level there's many Avenues I think they
 
02:01:20.450 --> 02:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
all need to be addressed and I think all
 
02:01:22.129 --> 02:01:22.139 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders should be invited in to
 
02:01:24.169 --> 02:01:24.179 align:start position:0%
try to craft a much better Bill if
 
02:01:26.089 --> 02:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
that's what the committee wants to do or
 
02:01:29.649 --> 02:01:29.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to you second
 
02:01:34.970 --> 02:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
um ditto because I think we spoke enough
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
about this
 
02:01:39.530 --> 02:01:39.540 align:start position:0%

confusing

02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
02:02:55.609 --> 02:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the executive
 
02:02:55.619 --> 02:02:57.169 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the executive
session

02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:57.179 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:02:57.179 --> 02:02:58.390 align:start position:0%

representative Manion
 
02:03:16.970 --> 02:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
and I believe he has an amendment do you
 
02:03:19.250 --> 02:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
have that yet
 
02:03:21.649 --> 02:03:21.659 align:start position:0%

Tuesday to address the amendment and I

believe we'll be able to come up with
 
02:03:32.689 --> 02:03:32.699 align:start position:0%
something that's workable to bring to
 
02:03:34.609 --> 02:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
the group and I trust you we'll take
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
care of the scheduling for that
 
02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:37.980 align:start position:0%

um for because for many reasons one
 
02:04:25.790 --> 02:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
being we still don't have any roadside
 
02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
test uh you know to perform if somebody

feel at this time with our current drug
 
02:04:46.129 --> 02:04:46.139 align:start position:0%
um problem that introducing another drug
 
02:04:48.169 --> 02:04:48.179 align:start position:0%
into the mix is just not a good good
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%

I might I'd like to Atlas build uh

the higher the use the higher the risk
marijuana

02:05:10.750 --> 02:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
02:05:13.729 --> 02:05:13.739 align:start position:0%
routinely contains 20 to 25 percent of
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
THC of the marijuana that people are
 
02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with in the 1970s that's a
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
hundred times increase of THC over what
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
it was in the 70s so looking around the
 
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
room here the 70s uh
 
02:05:29.810 --> 02:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
is a lot stronger than what it was in
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
the 70s
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
children don't have sense don't have the
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
sense to make good decisions they get
 
02:05:37.970 --> 02:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
hooked on drugs just as they get hooked
 
02:05:39.890 --> 02:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
on painkillers and go into stronger
 
02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
drugs it will hurt our youth it is
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
definitely a great gateway drug
 
02:05:46.129 --> 02:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of things that back that
 
02:05:46.139 --> 02:05:47.450 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of things that back that
up

02:05:47.450 --> 02:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:05:50.450 --> 02:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
this will degrade our community
 
02:05:52.669 --> 02:05:52.679 align:start position:0%
there is significant evidence that there
 
02:05:54.649 --> 02:05:54.659 align:start position:0%
is permanent brain damage from marijuana
 
02:05:56.709 --> 02:05:56.719 align:start position:0%
use under the age of 25
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
and it's very similar to lead poisoning
 
02:06:02.689 --> 02:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
so you can look up the combination
 
02:06:04.370 --> 02:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
between the two if you like
 
02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
it will affect our Workforce and
 
02:06:09.410 --> 02:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
possibly our military
 
02:06:11.450 --> 02:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
statistics show Highway death rates
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
related to marijuana have increased in
 
02:06:14.990 --> 02:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
other states since legalization and
 
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.430 align:start position:0%
other states since legalization and
commercialization

02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
commercialization
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
35 were in Colorado in 2017 up from 19
 
02:06:24.649 --> 02:06:24.659 align:start position:0%
so it went from 19 to 35 in Colorado
 
02:06:27.169 --> 02:06:27.179 align:start position:0%
because of the legalization of marijuana
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
according to national highway traffic
 
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
safety administration 12.6 percent of
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
weekend nighttime drivers test positive
 
02:06:39.250 --> 02:06:39.260 align:start position:0%
for THC and between 2013 and 2014
 
02:06:43.250 --> 02:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
compared to 8.6 in 2007 there is no
 
02:06:45.169 --> 02:06:45.179 align:start position:0%
acceptable roadside test the levels of
 
02:06:47.089 --> 02:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
THC in the bloodstream to determine
 
02:06:47.099 --> 02:06:48.350 align:start position:0%
THC in the bloodstream to determine
impairment

02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
impairment
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
but the impairment does exist
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
and that's it for today
 
02:06:55.129 --> 02:06:55.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:57.290 --> 02:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative Pratt
 
02:06:57.300 --> 02:06:58.310 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative Pratt
um

02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to address a couple of
 
02:07:05.689 --> 02:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
things that were brought up first of all
 
02:07:07.729 --> 02:07:07.739 align:start position:0%
speaking about roadside testing the
 
02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
reason why that's so difficult is
 
02:07:10.729 --> 02:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
because marijuana stays in your system
 
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
for up to 30 days and so doing roadside
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
testing doesn't necessarily describe
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're impaired so that's
 
02:07:20.689 --> 02:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
the reason why that doesn't exist and I
 
02:07:22.970 --> 02:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how they that would exist
 
02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:23.990 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how they that would exist
but

02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:07:27.229 --> 02:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
um okay but there are experts who can
 
02:07:31.070 --> 02:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
who try to distinguish I I'm blanking on
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
what the actual title is but people who
 
02:07:35.570 --> 02:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
are trained to identify whether someone
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
is is under the influence impaired in a
 
02:07:40.629 --> 02:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
way that it would actually
 
02:07:43.970 --> 02:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
there we go like that I love it
 
02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:45.050 align:start position:0%
there we go like that I love it
um also

02:07:45.050 --> 02:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
um also
 
02:07:47.570 --> 02:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
um let me see uh talking about you know
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
how it was different from the 70s I
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
think you're right that's that's true
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
there you know it has been selected to
 
02:07:56.209 --> 02:07:56.219 align:start position:0%
be more potent the thing is is that when
 
02:07:57.890 --> 02:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
you legalize something especially for
 
02:07:59.450 --> 02:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
you know over 21 I think that that's
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
responsible when you you legalize
 
02:08:03.050 --> 02:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
something that is when you actually get
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
to grade what it is what what the
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
potency is that's how you know what the
 
02:08:08.930 --> 02:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
potency is because when it's legalized
 
02:08:10.490 --> 02:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
you can test and analyze and then when
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
you're selling it
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
um you know wherever that might be you
 
02:08:15.169 --> 02:08:15.179 align:start position:0%
are able to say it is this potent it has
 
02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
this much CBD it has this much THC these
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
are legalizing it allows for us to be
 
02:08:22.250 --> 02:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
able to do that in the same way that you
 
02:08:23.570 --> 02:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
know when we did Prohibition of alcohol
 
02:08:25.550 --> 02:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
what did we have we had a whole bunch of
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
alcohol that was out there that was uh
 
02:08:29.149 --> 02:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
you know on the black market and it was
 
02:08:31.310 --> 02:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
killing people it was it was killing
 
02:08:32.810 --> 02:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
people because they didn't actually know
 
02:08:34.729 --> 02:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
what it was because it wasn't legal
 
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a system by which they
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
could actually assess the potency and
 
02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
things like that so it does allow for
 
02:08:41.930 --> 02:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
that and lastly I just want to speak to
 
02:08:44.330 --> 02:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry I know I I'm a little
 
02:08:47.089 --> 02:08:47.099 align:start position:0%
passionate about this one but if I could
 
02:08:49.250 --> 02:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
just uh speak to the gateway drug thing
 
02:08:52.250 --> 02:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
um I think that you know as a parent
 
02:08:53.930 --> 02:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
um I think you know right now it is
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
scheduled federally alongside heroin
 
02:09:00.050 --> 02:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and I can tell you I my children lost
 
02:09:03.169 --> 02:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
their father to heroin overdose okay so
 
02:09:05.629 --> 02:09:05.639 align:start position:0%
I can I can speak to the impact of that
 
02:09:07.550 --> 02:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
and I absolutely do not want my children
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh doing heroin or anything like that
 
02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
getting into that absolutely not at the
 
02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
same time I am very supportive of having
 
02:09:15.890 --> 02:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
this having cannabis legalized and I
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
think when we talk about a gateway drug
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
um I I think in a way it is but we have
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
made it that and the reason let me
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
explain why because I don't think that
 
02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
it is inherently a gateway drug but when
 
02:09:29.570 --> 02:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
we associate these two things when we
 
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
put these things in the same bucket when
 
02:09:34.490 --> 02:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
we put heroin in the same bucket as
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
marijuana we are essentially lying to
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
our children okay and then when um you
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
know a good amount of them are going to
 
02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
end up trying it anyway when they
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
realize that oh well this marijuana
 
02:09:48.890 --> 02:09:48.900 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily as bad as my parents
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
told me because we have lied to them and
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
put it in the same bucket as very
 
02:09:55.729 --> 02:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
harmful extremely harmful drugs and then
 
02:09:57.649 --> 02:09:57.659 align:start position:0%
so when we tell them that this is
 
02:09:59.450 --> 02:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
alongside those things and they realize
 
02:10:02.390 --> 02:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
that it's not as bad as we said was as
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
we the picture we painted they are more
 
02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
apt to think well maybe heroin isn't as
 
02:10:08.810 --> 02:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
bad as they said maybe path isn't as bad
 
02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
as they said that is the way that it is
 
02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
a gateway drug because we are
 
02:10:15.410 --> 02:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
categorizing it with drugs that have
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely no association with it so I'm
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
gonna I stepped down from my little soap
 
02:10:23.870 --> 02:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
box here thanks for the time
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
other than that do you have any strong
 
02:10:27.290 --> 02:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
feelings about the bill
 
02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bolden
 
02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:31.250 align:start position:0%
representative Bolden
thanks

02:10:31.250 --> 02:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
um I turned my speaker away from
 
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
Lauren's speaker I don't know if that's
 
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
going to help with the feedback but um
 
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
I would just I want to throw out the
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
idea of retain because I know that the
 
02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
perspectives on this topic in this
 
02:10:49.729 --> 02:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
committee are pretty consistently for
 
02:10:49.739 --> 02:10:51.709 align:start position:0%
committee are pretty consistently for
legalization

02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
02:10:54.649 --> 02:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
to some degree and
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
um while this bill might not well isn't
 
02:10:59.689 --> 02:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
the vehicle it's a shell that can be
 
02:11:02.209 --> 02:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
used next year if things go south in the
 
02:11:04.129 --> 02:11:04.139 align:start position:0%
senate or something along those lines I
 
02:11:07.129 --> 02:11:07.139 align:start position:0%
subbed on Commerce a couple days ago for
 
02:11:09.169 --> 02:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
the vote on the exact session on the
 
02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
legalization bill and the bills changed
 
02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:12.350 align:start position:0%
legalization bill and the bills changed
dramatically

02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
02:11:15.169 --> 02:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
since it was drafted by OLS in the first
 
02:11:17.450 --> 02:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
place and there's a lot of moving Parts
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
I think it would be a good opportunity
 
02:11:22.850 --> 02:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
for this committee to be able to pick up
 
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
the subject matter next year if things
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
go Haywire this year or if there are
 
02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
some essential components maybe in this
 
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
year's bill that are really missed so
 
02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
just a suggestion to retain
 
02:11:38.089 --> 02:11:38.099 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm open to that
 
02:11:40.270 --> 02:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
suggestion um however keep in mind
 
02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
retained bills have to be reported out
 
02:11:46.850 --> 02:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
um by October with a
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
OTP or itl so it doesn't give us that
 
02:11:52.729 --> 02:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
much time to sit on it so I'm not did we
 
02:11:57.229 --> 02:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
we retained it which is marijuana so I
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
think we've already got one of those in
 
02:12:04.609 --> 02:12:04.619 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
in the bucket representative wheeler
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I I'll be
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
voting against the it on motion on this
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
bill for a lot of the same reasons that
 
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative Newell brought up
 
02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
um I think the real gateway drug is
 
02:12:19.970 --> 02:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
alcohol that's proven by the numbers I
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
mean I remember being in high school and
 
02:12:24.350 --> 02:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
having many more kids in high school
 
02:12:26.089 --> 02:12:26.099 align:start position:0%
even in Peterborough which is the Old
 
02:12:27.970 --> 02:12:27.980 align:start position:0%
Hippie town where they used alcohol
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
significantly more than marijuana it was
 
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
it was the that was the party drug and
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
and I could see that seriously negative
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
negatively affecting kids minds and
 
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
there are studies now coming out that
 
02:12:41.209 --> 02:12:41.219 align:start position:0%
are saying that no safe amount of
 
02:12:41.219 --> 02:12:42.010 align:start position:0%
are saying that no safe amount of
alcohol

02:12:42.010 --> 02:12:42.020 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
02:12:44.689 --> 02:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
no amount of consumption of alcohol is
 
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
safe that it can affect your brain that
 
02:12:49.370 --> 02:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
it leads to dementia and Alzheimer's
 
02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
even with small amounts of use and
 
02:12:54.169 --> 02:12:54.179 align:start position:0%
frankly I've seen that in a number of
 
02:12:54.179 --> 02:12:55.129 align:start position:0%
frankly I've seen that in a number of
people

02:12:55.129 --> 02:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
um even kids who are becoming
 
02:12:59.629 --> 02:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
significantly more forgetful and acting
 
02:13:02.209 --> 02:13:02.219 align:start position:0%
dangerously acting violently changing
 
02:13:04.609 --> 02:13:04.619 align:start position:0%
their personality I have not seen that
 
02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
with anecdotally with the people who I
 
02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
know smoke marijuana I've I've seen uh
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
maybe at the most a lack of motivation
 
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
which as representative Reed and I
 
02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
talked about one day is definitely a
 
02:13:20.209 --> 02:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
concern but not a large enough concern
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
for me to think that we should be
 
02:13:26.330 --> 02:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
criminalizing a plant uh which and I I
 
02:13:28.010 --> 02:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
frankly think that the criminalization
 
02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
um only causes more problems than than
 
02:13:36.109 --> 02:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
uh legalizing it would and I don't need
 
02:13:38.089 --> 02:13:38.099 align:start position:0%
to go on and on about those problems I'm
 
02:13:39.890 --> 02:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
sure all of us are very aware having
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
heard these bills so many times but just
 
02:13:44.689 --> 02:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
the one point I'll make is that there
 
02:13:48.169 --> 02:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
are people all across this state who in
 
02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
simply possessing this are now made
 
02:13:54.410 --> 02:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
criminals because we have uh pushed the
 
02:13:56.569 --> 02:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
buck off from legalizing the substance
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
since the 70s so I'll be voting uh to
 
02:14:01.069 --> 02:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
legalize the substance
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:03.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
02:14:07.010 --> 02:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Mr chair do you
 
02:14:08.990 --> 02:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
believe that anyone is going to change
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
their vote from the discussions being
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
had within our executive session
 
02:14:17.810 --> 02:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
it's quite possible
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative ceiling
 
02:14:22.970 --> 02:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you I I just want to add another
 
02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
component to the discussion
 
02:14:25.980 --> 02:14:26.629 align:start position:0%
component to the discussion
um

02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:29.569 --> 02:14:29.579 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll speak anecdotally yeah
 
02:14:31.669 --> 02:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that's how I use
 
02:14:34.129 --> 02:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
um which is that there are also a number
 
02:14:35.930 --> 02:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
of studies and there's evidence and
 
02:14:37.970 --> 02:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
there are people that I've spoken to
 
02:14:41.470 --> 02:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
who suffer from Fairly extreme anxiety
 
02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
ADHD or some combination thereof and the
 
02:14:47.340 --> 02:14:48.470 align:start position:0%
ADHD or some combination thereof and the
um

02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
if they add alcohol into their
 
02:14:52.729 --> 02:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
bloodstream it increases their anxiety
 
02:14:56.689 --> 02:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
it increases their other symptoms and
 
02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
leads them to make
 
02:15:00.649 --> 02:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
generally less responsible choices but
 
02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
yet alcohol is legal for them to take
 
02:15:06.290 --> 02:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
when they have chosen to
 
02:15:08.990 --> 02:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
use marijuana whether by smoking or
 
02:15:12.370 --> 02:15:12.380 align:start position:0%
using Edibles it's helped them to
 
02:15:14.930 --> 02:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
compensate and suppress some of the
 
02:15:16.669 --> 02:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
anxiety symptoms suppress some of the
 
02:15:17.930 --> 02:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
other symptoms
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that for a number of
 
02:15:22.970 --> 02:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
people with ADD ad ADHD and anxiety the
 
02:15:24.729 --> 02:15:24.739 align:start position:0%
medications for those have a significant
 
02:15:27.649 --> 02:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
detrimental impact on their appetite
 
02:15:30.770 --> 02:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of studies that show
 
02:15:32.569 --> 02:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
and there's a reason why Girl Scouts
 
02:15:34.490 --> 02:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
like to set up their cookie stamps next
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
to dispensaries that people who are
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
using marijuana
 
02:15:41.330 --> 02:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
will and it's used in as for medicinal
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
purposes for this but as an appetite
 
02:15:46.550 --> 02:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
stimulant and so for people who suffer
 
02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
from those conditions it can be truly
 
02:15:51.530 --> 02:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
medically beneficial
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
um in in terms of the comment before
 
02:15:54.649 --> 02:15:54.659 align:start position:0%
about it
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
um being a gateway drug an addictive
 
02:15:59.629 --> 02:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
it's not the marijuana itself that's
 
02:16:01.010 --> 02:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
addictive it's often the things that
 
02:16:02.569 --> 02:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
it's laced with again because it's not
 
02:16:05.689 --> 02:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
regulated once we legalize it and we can
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
regulate and ensure that what people are
 
02:16:09.410 --> 02:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
getting is a pure product
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
just as we regulate alcohol we can help
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
protect people from the types of
 
02:16:14.930 --> 02:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
addictive substances that are often
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
laced into it
 
02:16:18.589 --> 02:16:18.599 align:start position:0%
thank you I think at this point
 
02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
everyone's had a chance on both sides of
 
02:16:22.370 --> 02:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
the issue to speak I'm going to ask the

representative Pratt Will you uh be
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
running the majority or who about the
 
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
who made the motion
 
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
02:18:12.530 --> 02:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
um and that will obviously not be going
 
02:18:13.730 --> 02:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
on consent
 
02:18:16.009 --> 02:18:16.019 align:start position:0%
and lastly I have a question for the
 
02:18:16.019 --> 02:18:17.089 align:start position:0%
and lastly I have a question for the
committee

02:18:17.089 --> 02:18:17.099 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
um we discussed some changes to House
 
02:18:24.169 --> 02:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
Bill 400 and I'm going to tell you what
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
I was about to ask for from OLS however
 
02:18:29.570 --> 02:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
if you're not going to vote for it
 
02:18:30.589 --> 02:18:30.599 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm not going to keep everyone
 
02:18:32.929 --> 02:18:32.939 align:start position:0%
here while I get it so if I make the
 
02:18:36.530 --> 02:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
changes in change line if everyone could
 
02:18:40.669 --> 02:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
grab that bill please house bill 400.
 
02:18:43.849 --> 02:18:43.859 align:start position:0%
if I change
 
02:18:46.750 --> 02:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
page 2 line 16.
 
02:18:50.330 --> 02:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
to change it to um
 
02:18:52.910 --> 02:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
criminal misconduct it would be the
 
02:18:56.209 --> 02:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
class B felony and then misconduct would
 
02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
be a misdemeanor
 
02:19:01.849 --> 02:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
and if I change the 21 feet to a
 
02:19:01.859 --> 02:19:03.830 align:start position:0%
and if I change the 21 feet to a
distance

02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
distance
 
02:19:06.169 --> 02:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
to a distance specified by the officer
 
02:19:07.610 --> 02:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
that way no one has to guess how many
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
feet it's just as far as the officer
 
02:19:11.209 --> 02:19:11.219 align:start position:0%
says get back and if they don't they be
 
02:19:12.530 --> 02:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
subject to arrest
 
02:19:14.690 --> 02:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
and it does I would I would point out
 
02:19:17.209 --> 02:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
that it does say a reasonable officer
 
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
and fear of his safety so someone can't
 
02:19:20.089 --> 02:19:20.099 align:start position:0%
an officer is not going to be able to
 
02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
say go back a mile that would not be
 
02:19:22.679 --> 02:19:23.929 align:start position:0%
say go back a mile that would not be
reasonable

02:19:23.929 --> 02:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
and I believe that was the only other
 
02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman would would an arm
 
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to throw this out there
 
02:19:33.650 --> 02:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
like because I see this being a
 
02:19:35.810 --> 02:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
potential situation as well what's one
 
02:19:40.490 --> 02:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
one person in my own personal world like
 
02:19:43.009 --> 02:19:43.019 align:start position:0%
my arm's length is
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
what I consider to be as far as I want
 
02:19:47.570 --> 02:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
you to get to me well that's a lot
 
02:19:48.889 --> 02:19:48.899 align:start position:0%
different for a police officer police
 
02:19:50.510 --> 02:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
officer he's at least 30 feet for
 
02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
someone who pulls a knife and runs at
 
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
them and they're ready for them to be
 
02:19:55.070 --> 02:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
able to draw their firearm and stop them
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
okay that's why thank you yeah
 
02:19:57.359 --> 02:19:57.950 align:start position:0%
okay that's why thank you yeah
um

02:19:57.950 --> 02:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:57.960 --> 02:19:59.410 align:start position:0%
um
wheeler

02:19:59.410 --> 02:19:59.420 align:start position:0%
wheeler
 
02:20:02.090 --> 02:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
those changes would change my vote Mr
 
02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
chairman I would vote I mean the 21 feet
 
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
thing I'm pretty sure representative
 
02:20:07.969 --> 02:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
prues Point made me uh less concerned
 
02:20:10.250 --> 02:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
about that um but to representative
 
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
manion's point if you made those changes
 
02:20:13.250 --> 02:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
about the misconduct and the the
 
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
criminal allegations I would be much
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
more in favor of voting for this okay
 
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
and would do so okay um and I know there
 
02:20:21.950 --> 02:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
are still concerns about the bail aspect
 
02:20:24.469 --> 02:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
of it however I cannot bring myself to
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
change that it's uh um it's we have
 
02:20:30.170 --> 02:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
several laws on the books that specify
 
02:20:32.210 --> 02:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
that do make um
 
02:20:34.310 --> 02:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
bail issues including domestic violence
 
02:20:37.370 --> 02:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
type issues I while we are going to
 
02:20:39.410 --> 02:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
address the overall issue of bail and
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
how we deal with people getting out on
 
02:20:42.770 --> 02:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
bail and who's going to handle it and
 
02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of it that does not affect
 
02:20:47.570 --> 02:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
what we do with certain charges and we
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
already have some on the books and I
 
02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
feel like if you are dangerous enough
 
02:20:53.630 --> 02:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
that you would assault an armed police
 
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
officer it needs to be a judge who
 
02:20:58.490 --> 02:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
decides whether or not you should be
 
02:21:01.730 --> 02:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
able to be let free so that one I'm not
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
willing to change so I have one person
 
02:21:07.130 --> 02:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
willing to support it as is and anyone
 
02:21:07.140 --> 02:21:08.030 align:start position:0%
willing to support it as is and anyone
else

02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:21:10.210 --> 02:21:10.220 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely
 
02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
I see you down there where we have
 
02:21:19.849 --> 02:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.610 --> 02:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
just about how having the judge versus
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
having it go through the what we
 
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
currently have as a bail bondsman
 
02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:27.650 align:start position:0%
currently have as a bail bondsman
process

02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble wrapping my head
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
around that and and I just hoping we
 
02:21:32.690 --> 02:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
could whether it's him or someone else
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
could just clarify well I think I I can
 
02:21:36.889 --> 02:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
I can clarify that currently if you were
 
02:21:38.570 --> 02:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
arrested and you assaulted a police
 
02:21:41.570 --> 02:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
officer it's a simple assault charge
 
02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
um they would call the bail clerk if it
 
02:21:44.809 --> 02:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
was after hours they would come in and
 
02:21:45.889 --> 02:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
uh not the bill collect the bill
 
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner and they would uh
 
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
set the bill at whatever they've deemed
 
02:21:53.809 --> 02:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
appropriate at the time but my concern
 
02:21:56.330 --> 02:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
was is that we currently have a
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
communication problem where someone
 
02:22:00.170 --> 02:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
could have already been arrested and
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
that person would not know it so you
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
could have multiple people you could
 
02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
have someone released on multiple
 
02:22:07.070 --> 02:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
charges out of different police stations
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
and one of those being for assaulting a
 
02:22:10.370 --> 02:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
police officer and the next place
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even know that you're out on
 
02:22:13.309 --> 02:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
bail so right now we have some issues we
 
02:22:15.250 --> 02:22:15.260 align:start position:0%
have to handle as far as the whole
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
situation goes the bail system which is
 
02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
why we retained the other bill
 
02:22:23.090 --> 02:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Newell thank you
 
02:22:24.349 --> 02:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:22:27.170 --> 02:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
um I think what's really kind of keeping
 
02:22:29.690 --> 02:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
me on it because I I do think that it's
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
a good intent and it's uh it's it's good
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
um at the end of the day I'm I'm
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
concerned about you know
 
02:22:38.210 --> 02:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
we we entrust what we talked about
 
02:22:40.010 --> 02:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
earlier was um that they are
 
02:22:41.389 --> 02:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
representing the public and representing
 
02:22:43.309 --> 02:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
the public and acting on behalf of the
 
02:22:45.050 --> 02:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
the public and really I mean you know
 
02:22:47.809 --> 02:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
the the cliche way you know having a
 
02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
monopoly on violence right but at the
 
02:22:52.370 --> 02:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
end of the day if we entrust uh police
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
officers with that
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
um and especially when it comes to uh
 
02:22:57.410 --> 02:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
firefighters EMS you know other people
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
that we're including like I said in the
 
02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
first place um I talked about body worn
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
cameras those are not consistent across
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
the board and I think that you know um
 
02:23:09.650 --> 02:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
I just think that with that uh that
 
02:23:11.570 --> 02:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
power and responsibility
 
02:23:12.650 --> 02:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
um comes
 
02:23:15.889 --> 02:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
um accountability is necessary and a
 
02:23:17.809 --> 02:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
high burden of proof at that point so
 
02:23:20.330 --> 02:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
I'm I am concerned about kind of um
 
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences from it
 
02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
potentially and um I mean absolutely no
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
offense to anyone when I say that I
 
02:23:28.969 --> 02:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
think that you know the burden of proof
 
02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
on all in all ways should be but if
 
02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:32.330 align:start position:0%
on all in all ways should be but if
we're

02:23:32.330 --> 02:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
we're
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
um attaching these kind of heightened
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
um penalties for it I think you know we
 
02:23:37.610 --> 02:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
really need to have heightened
 
02:23:40.670 --> 02:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
accountability to accountability to go
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
along with that
 
02:23:46.309 --> 02:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and um currently the the state
 
02:23:48.050 --> 02:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
at the direction of the governor has
 
02:23:50.570 --> 02:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
formed a commission that is going to
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
adopt a set of very rigorous standards
 
02:23:55.610 --> 02:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
um for accreditation across the state
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
and um they're in the process of
 
02:23:59.450 --> 02:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
compiling that right now and part of
 
02:24:01.130 --> 02:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
that a lot of these issues are going to
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
be in order for a department to consider
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
itself accredited they're going to have
 
02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
to meet these standards and they're set
 
02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
most of them or many of them are
 
02:24:11.090 --> 02:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
mandated by the federal doj so it's it's
 
02:24:12.309 --> 02:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
going to be quite rigorous
 
02:24:16.190 --> 02:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm just concerned about this whole
 
02:24:21.170 --> 02:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
conversation I didn't hear exactly what
 
02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
you were trying to do uh I understand
 
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
that we discussed things but I I am just
 
02:24:27.170 --> 02:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
the part I'm concerned about is we're
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
asking people kind of polling people for
 
02:24:31.849 --> 02:24:31.859 align:start position:0%
whether they would vote for the bill not
 
02:24:34.130 --> 02:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
having seen the written amendment I just
 
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
think that's important thank you yeah um
 
02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
but these this is obviously a
 
02:24:40.429 --> 02:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
non-binding poll I'm trying to see
 
02:24:41.690 --> 02:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
whether it's worth the committee's time
 
02:24:44.170 --> 02:24:44.180 align:start position:0%
for me to obtain the actual
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment and represent Muse
 
02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:50.950 align:start position:0%
Amendment and represent Muse
foreign

02:24:50.950 --> 02:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
in the spirit of the way we've been kind
 
02:24:56.690 --> 02:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
of dealing with the bail issue all along
 
02:24:58.910 --> 02:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
um something I might suggest if we're
 
02:25:01.490 --> 02:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
going to amend the bill uh would be to
 
02:25:04.250 --> 02:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
put that section out but to park it Mr
 
02:25:07.490 --> 02:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
chair for our our conversation so I
 
02:25:09.770 --> 02:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
think that there I think it's actually
 
02:25:12.530 --> 02:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
possible for us to pass a bill that's
 
02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
helpful that does a lot of the things
 
02:25:17.090 --> 02:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
that people have said they want to do
 
02:25:19.370 --> 02:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
um but but for me the inclusion of the
 
02:25:22.190 --> 02:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
bill provision would be a would be a
 
02:25:23.870 --> 02:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
deal breaker because I think it goes
 
02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:25.010 align:start position:0%
deal breaker because I think it goes
against

02:25:25.010 --> 02:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:25:26.990 --> 02:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
um what we've been talking about for all
 
02:25:29.090 --> 02:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
of our other conversations regarding
 
02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
regarding bails so I hate to be the
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
person who gums up the works
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
um but I I do have a strong preference
 
02:25:39.050 --> 02:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
for for dealing with all of the bail
 
02:25:41.690 --> 02:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
issues down the road and and not picking
 
02:25:45.010 --> 02:25:45.020 align:start position:0%
because I mean if we wanted to I mean
 
02:25:47.929 --> 02:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
I could there were things that I can
 
02:25:49.610 --> 02:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
pick apart especially about another bill
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to come in front of us 653
 
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and you know and unfortunately I
 
02:25:58.849 --> 02:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
think if we if we if we do it once
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
um you know we're going to have a harder
 
02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
time down the road so my suggestion
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
would be let's not let's not forget
 
02:26:08.210 --> 02:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
about this let's make it part of the con
 
02:26:11.090 --> 02:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
the conversation but in the spirit of
 
02:26:12.770 --> 02:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
getting through legislation that would
 
02:26:14.090 --> 02:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
be helpful
 
02:26:16.730 --> 02:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
um it would be I would
 
02:26:20.090 --> 02:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
ask you to consider removing it
 
02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I am taking what you
 
02:26:24.170 --> 02:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
just said into consideration
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt
 
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh we talked about reducing the criminal
 
02:26:31.070 --> 02:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
aspect of this could you uh speak a
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more on that sure so what it
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
would do is if you make a false
 
02:26:38.090 --> 02:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
allegation against a police officer that
 
02:26:41.210 --> 02:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
the police officer committed a crime
 
02:26:43.130 --> 02:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
um a felony a class B felony if it's
 
02:26:48.889 --> 02:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
simply that they did misconduct I.E the
 
02:26:50.809 --> 02:26:50.819 align:start position:0%
circumstance where the representative
 
02:26:53.510 --> 02:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
said the mother said uh you know you're
 
02:26:55.250 --> 02:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
yelling at the most that could be is a
 
02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:56.389 align:start position:0%
yelling at the most that could be is a
misdemeanor

02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
02:26:57.770 --> 02:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
um and if it was proved that it was
 
02:27:00.110 --> 02:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
intentional and it was blatantly false
 
02:27:02.330 --> 02:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
so that's a pretty high standard but it
 
02:27:04.730 --> 02:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
still has teeth to it so that stays the
 
02:27:07.450 --> 02:27:07.460 align:start position:0%
same yeah oh okay
 
02:27:07.460 --> 02:27:08.990 align:start position:0%
same yeah oh okay
okay

02:27:08.990 --> 02:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:27:10.849 --> 02:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
um with that I'm gonna and I know
 
02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to go home but we're
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
doing pretty good here so I'm going to
 
02:27:16.610 --> 02:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
call her a recess until
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
um let's take 45 minutes
 
02:27:21.170 --> 02:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
um 12 15. I'll see if I can get this
 
02:27:22.730 --> 02:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
amendment and we'll get this done and
 
02:27:23.690 --> 02:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
we'll get out of here for the weekend
 
02:27:25.309 --> 02:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
representative Bolden
 
02:27:26.690 --> 02:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:27.950 --> 02:27:27.960 align:start position:0%

02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative Muse it'd be cool to just

pull it out save it for later the Bell
 
02:27:33.530 --> 02:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
part but I mostly want to say I think
 
02:27:35.150 --> 02:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
you're doing a really great job as chair
 
02:27:37.849 --> 02:27:37.859 align:start position:0%

02:27:38.990 --> 02:27:39.000 align:start position:0%

02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%

03:17:24.830 --> 03:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:24.840 --> 03:19:02.389 align:start position:0%

03:19:11.100 --> 03:19:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
questions

03:19:37.990 --> 03:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
the whole thing was established and run
 
03:19:43.090 --> 03:19:43.100 align:start position:0%

03:20:01.250 --> 03:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
he was very unhappy with the speaker and
 
03:20:02.630 --> 03:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
was trying to make a commentary about
 
03:20:10.809 --> 03:20:10.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:13.550 --> 03:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
that we were voting in the bill to make
 
03:20:16.910 --> 03:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:16.920 --> 03:20:23.889 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:20:23.889 --> 03:20:23.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:25.969 --> 03:20:25.979 align:start position:0%
we were debating the bill it wouldn't
 
03:20:28.250 --> 03:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
have been not introduced but it was it
 
03:20:29.990 --> 03:20:30.000 align:start position:0%

fourth graders who were in The Gallery
 
03:20:34.130 --> 03:20:34.140 align:start position:0%

04:01:39.410 --> 04:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:01:42.769 --> 04:01:42.779 align:start position:0%
thank you um speaking to the amendment I
 
04:01:45.050 --> 04:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
listened to everyone and I've made
 
04:01:47.090 --> 04:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
numerous changes to it
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
um I've changed the from the felony to
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
the misdemeanor a Class A misdemeanor if
 
04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
they make a false report about a law
 
04:01:56.929 --> 04:01:56.939 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer involving a criminal
 
04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
offense and it's an unclassified
 
04:02:01.070 --> 04:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor if they make a false report
 
04:02:03.349 --> 04:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
by about a police officer or any EMS
 
04:02:06.650 --> 04:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
file I added that to that is a active
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
misconduct against their rules of
 
04:02:11.689 --> 04:02:11.699 align:start position:0%
regulations or the um
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
training Council and then
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
I also took out the part about bail
 
04:02:21.889 --> 04:02:21.899 align:start position:0%
so the bail issue will be dealt with as
 
04:02:24.530 --> 04:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
part of the overall bail when we get to
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
that and I believe that was everyone's
 
04:02:26.279 --> 04:02:27.410 align:start position:0%
that and I believe that was everyone's
concerns

04:02:27.410 --> 04:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:02:36.610 --> 04:02:36.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:39.290 --> 04:02:39.300 align:start position:0%

04:02:50.809 --> 04:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is the amendment and
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%

changes from the original bill
 
04:03:13.070 --> 04:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we have to remember the amendment

then we vote on the bill as amended okay

04:06:10.460 --> 04:06:12.550 align:start position:0%
 
-0592h

to HB 351 FN Auto pass
 
04:06:19.010 --> 04:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
do I have a second
 
04:06:21.050 --> 04:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
representative saley
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:27.530 --> 04:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
yes with this what this bill does is it
 
04:06:29.630 --> 04:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
increa is it uh
 
04:06:31.969 --> 04:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
uh it strengthens uh New Hampshire's
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
Firearms negligence law uh regarding
 
04:06:34.560 --> 04:06:36.170 align:start position:0%
Firearms negligence law uh regarding
children

04:06:36.170 --> 04:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:06:39.950 --> 04:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
um uh the amendment the amendment also
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
eliminates the first part of the bill
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
that that folks had problems with that
 
04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
would have required uh all uh transfers
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
and sales of guns in New Hampshire
 
04:06:52.990 --> 04:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
including Private Sales
 
04:06:55.729 --> 04:06:55.739 align:start position:0%
to be accompanied by a locking safety
 
04:06:57.950 --> 04:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
device there was testimony of the
 
04:07:00.229 --> 04:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
hearing that
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
um that the expense of that may place an
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
undue burden on some on some gun owners
 
04:07:07.750 --> 04:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
there was also testimony
 
04:07:11.389 --> 04:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
that some devices are more effective
 
04:07:13.450 --> 04:07:13.460 align:start position:0%
than others
 
04:07:17.090 --> 04:07:17.100 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I think that we
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
all did agree on when we took a really
 
04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
good look at our Firearms negligence law
 
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
04:07:27.710 --> 04:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
um it's extremely weak the way that it
 
04:07:30.769 --> 04:07:30.779 align:start position:0%
stands it can use some beefing up and uh
 
04:07:32.750 --> 04:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh and and I think the other thing that
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
we agree on is that any
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
any incident involving an unsecured
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
firearm in a child
 
04:07:42.889 --> 04:07:42.899 align:start position:0%
um is uh
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
an incredibly unnecessary tragedy uh and
 
04:07:49.849 --> 04:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
and I think our goal as a criminal
 
04:07:51.650 --> 04:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
justice and Public Safety Committee is
 
04:07:54.349 --> 04:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
you know to do the best we can to
 
04:07:57.110 --> 04:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
minimize those incidents and by
 
04:08:00.290 --> 04:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
um not only increasing increasing the
 
04:08:03.650 --> 04:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
penalty uh but also hopefully by getting
 
04:08:06.530 --> 04:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh some publicity for the fact that
 
04:08:08.030 --> 04:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're actually making the change
 
04:08:10.610 --> 04:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
and and gee whiz if we do this we're
 
04:08:12.590 --> 04:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
actually enacting
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
um a uh a firearm safety measure that
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
that finally hopefully everyone can
 
04:08:20.090 --> 04:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
agree on
 
04:08:21.830 --> 04:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
um we can agree that we we want to keep
 
04:08:24.830 --> 04:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
kids as safe as we can so
 
04:08:26.750 --> 04:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
um in that spirit I offer this amendment
 
04:08:29.210 --> 04:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
and I hope that you vote for it thank
 
04:08:29.220 --> 04:08:30.710 align:start position:0%
and I hope that you vote for it thank
you

04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:08:32.090 --> 04:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
representative selig would you like to
 
04:08:33.410 --> 04:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
speak to you second
 
04:08:35.929 --> 04:08:35.939 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I I'm very strongly in
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
support of this amendment and this bill
 
04:08:40.849 --> 04:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
um we had a situation in the community
 
04:08:43.729 --> 04:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
where I live where a child was having a
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
party and brought out a loaded weapon
 
04:08:50.330 --> 04:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
to display to his friends one of whom
 
04:08:52.130 --> 04:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
went to get the parents and say they
 
04:08:54.530 --> 04:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
were frightened and the parents response
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
was to laugh
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
and then take the gun and put it away
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
the child said I want to call my parents
 
04:09:03.170 --> 04:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
and go home and the parents said no you
 
04:09:05.150 --> 04:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
can't do that and made the child stay
 
04:09:08.090 --> 04:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
despite the child's discomfort
 
04:09:10.189 --> 04:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
to me there should be a criminal penalty
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
for for doing that you know it's it's
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
wrong it's unsafe we're lucky that no
 
04:09:16.189 --> 04:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
one was inadvertently shot during that
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
interaction but also in my community
 
04:09:21.290 --> 04:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
seven years ago we lost a child to a
 
04:09:25.030 --> 04:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
fifth grader to suicide by
 
04:09:27.050 --> 04:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
self-inflicted gunshot wound from an
 
04:09:29.450 --> 04:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
unsecured firearm in the family and so I
 
04:09:30.950 --> 04:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
just think whatever we can do to help
 
04:09:32.689 --> 04:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
save our kids and protect our kids is
 
04:09:32.699 --> 04:09:35.170 align:start position:0%

stored and shot himself and it was one

I don't know that's a good question
 
04:13:07.800 --> 04:13:08.510 align:start position:0%
I don't know that's a good question
um

04:13:08.510 --> 04:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:10.370 --> 04:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
it's open for discussion at this point I
 
04:13:12.410 --> 04:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
have a question representative Muse on
 
04:13:14.689 --> 04:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
the on the bill when we talk about
 
04:13:17.630 --> 04:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
Firearms exhibited or displayed to other
 
04:13:19.189 --> 04:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
minor children who are members of the
 
04:13:21.889 --> 04:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
household with with that would that not
 
04:13:24.349 --> 04:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
qualify for example if I have a rifle uh
 
04:13:27.530 --> 04:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
above my mantle or if I have it in a
 
04:13:29.630 --> 04:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
glass gun cabinet where it's displayed
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh with lights on it so you can see it
 
04:13:40.689 --> 04:13:40.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:43.010 --> 04:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
it's displayed in the sense that we use
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
it and our other in you know in other
 
04:13:47.450 --> 04:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
parts of our law uh where we're talking
 
04:13:49.849 --> 04:13:49.859 align:start position:0%
about uh displaying the weapon openly
 
04:13:52.189 --> 04:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
but the the assumption would be that the
 
04:13:54.349 --> 04:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
the child would be handling the weapon
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
at that point okay so any person who
 
04:13:57.830 --> 04:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
stores or leaves on premises under
 
04:13:57.840 --> 04:13:59.269 align:start position:0%
stores or leaves on premises under
control

04:13:59.269 --> 04:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:14:01.849 --> 04:14:01.859 align:start position:0%
an unloaded firearm with unsecured
 
04:14:03.710 --> 04:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
compatibles in such a manner that is
 
04:14:05.389 --> 04:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
available to a child with the
 
04:14:08.510 --> 04:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
supervision or without the supervision
 
04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
or permission of child's parent Guardian
 
04:14:11.870 --> 04:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
this gets me if the child gains access
 
04:14:14.290 --> 04:14:14.300 align:start position:0%
farm and the firearm is displayed
 
04:14:16.790 --> 04:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
exhibited so the precursor that
 
04:14:19.429 --> 04:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
necessary to that would be the child
 
04:14:22.849 --> 04:14:22.859 align:start position:0%
um gains access to the firearm okay
 
04:14:25.330 --> 04:14:25.340 align:start position:0%
so that would be covered
 
04:14:27.710 --> 04:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
and what what this specifically does
 
04:14:31.070 --> 04:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
address uh would be and and bring within
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
the scope of the the concept of
 
04:14:36.650 --> 04:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
negligence is currently in order to be
 
04:14:38.870 --> 04:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
charged with a violation uh somebody who
 
04:14:42.469 --> 04:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
leaves an unsecured firearm out uh the
 
04:14:43.969 --> 04:14:43.979 align:start position:0%
child would actually have to pick up the
 
04:14:45.530 --> 04:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
firearm use it in a reckless or
 
04:14:47.689 --> 04:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
threatening manner use it in the
 
04:14:49.490 --> 04:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
commission of a crime
 
04:14:51.769 --> 04:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
um or you know negligently and
 
04:14:54.950 --> 04:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
recklessly display it so
 
04:14:57.950 --> 04:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
um what it what it doesn't cover are
 
04:15:01.130 --> 04:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
issues like the incident uh that
 
04:15:02.570 --> 04:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
happened a few weeks ago with a
 
04:15:04.849 --> 04:15:04.859 align:start position:0%
six-year-old brought the firearm to
 
04:15:04.859 --> 04:15:06.290 align:start position:0%
six-year-old brought the firearm to
school

04:15:06.290 --> 04:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:15:09.050 --> 04:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
um shot his teacher
 
04:15:12.050 --> 04:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
um it it would cover incidents where
 
04:15:14.450 --> 04:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
children you know and and I do
 
04:15:16.010 --> 04:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
understand that we do have an existing
 
04:15:17.689 --> 04:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
law against fire against children
 
04:15:21.530 --> 04:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
bringing Firearms into a school but uh I
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
think the idea is that um in kids are
 
04:15:27.290 --> 04:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
kids and a lot of times when an
 
04:15:29.210 --> 04:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
unsecured firearm kind of comes into
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
their hands they go they look at it
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
almost as a toy and something it's it's
 
04:15:36.410 --> 04:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
exciting it's different it's something
 
04:15:38.510 --> 04:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
to show their friends
 
04:15:41.150 --> 04:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
um uh it's something their parents may
 
04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
be proud of and
 
04:15:45.410 --> 04:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to go back to sort of
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
thinking like a child but the but the
 
04:15:50.450 --> 04:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
issue is is when you when you when a
 
04:15:53.330 --> 04:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
child takes an unsecured firearm out of
 
04:15:55.070 --> 04:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
the home brings it into somebody else's
 
04:15:57.650 --> 04:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
home brings it into a place where other
 
04:15:59.570 --> 04:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
people are present
 
04:16:01.729 --> 04:16:01.739 align:start position:0%
um not only do you have a you know the
 
04:16:03.889 --> 04:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
the danger of
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
um the child accidentally firing the
 
04:16:09.170 --> 04:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
weapon you also have you know the the
 
04:16:10.910 --> 04:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
danger sometimes of an accidental
 
04:16:13.729 --> 04:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
discharge if they just drop the weapon
 
04:16:17.570 --> 04:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
so from a from a safety perspective
 
04:16:20.450 --> 04:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
um I from a public safety perspective I
 
04:16:23.450 --> 04:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
think that what this would do is is
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
actually bring within the scope of the
 
04:16:26.640 --> 04:16:27.650 align:start position:0%
actually bring within the scope of the
law

04:16:27.650 --> 04:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:16:30.050 --> 04:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
um uh a lot of the incidents I think
 
04:16:31.790 --> 04:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing about and and that
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
we've been concerned about
 
04:16:37.849 --> 04:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
um and uh and and it would make our our
 
04:16:40.870 --> 04:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
current law which you know and I think
 
04:16:44.090 --> 04:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
if you if you if you look at the RSA the
 
04:16:45.650 --> 04:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
way it currently reads it's a little
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
ridiculous that ours that are standard
 
04:16:51.229 --> 04:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
for negligence is is so high that the
 
04:16:53.030 --> 04:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
child actually needs to fire the gun
 
04:16:54.830 --> 04:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
shoot somebody
 
04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
um or committed commit a crime with it
 
04:16:59.750 --> 04:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
in order for somebody to be to be
 
04:17:04.370 --> 04:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
charged with um with a violation
 
04:17:09.950 --> 04:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
um and um so I think the bill uh sends a
 
04:17:13.610 --> 04:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
it just it reinf what I would I would
 
04:17:15.290 --> 04:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
put this into the category of something
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
that reinforces our current policy
 
04:17:20.809 --> 04:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
um this this is something
 
04:17:23.450 --> 04:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
we don't want any gun owner to leave an
 
04:17:25.790 --> 04:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
unsecured gun in anywhere where a child
 
04:17:29.269 --> 04:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
can get it and and what this does is it
 
04:17:31.729 --> 04:17:31.739 align:start position:0%
basically reinforces and confirms our
 
04:17:35.330 --> 04:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
existing policy and uh uh and sends a
 
04:17:38.450 --> 04:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
strong message that um yes under the
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution you have the right to own a
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
firearm but you also have the
 
04:17:43.849 --> 04:17:43.859 align:start position:0%
responsibility to keep it out of the
 
04:17:46.969 --> 04:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
hands of a minor child thank you that's
 
04:17:48.769 --> 04:17:48.779 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here thank you
