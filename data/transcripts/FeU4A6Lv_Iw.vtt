00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to start off we
 
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
have three three um speakers two of
 
00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
which are from um art AR labs and then
 
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
getting it right from the start
 
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
representative from there I'm going to
 
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
ask speakers to try to keep it to three
 
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
to five minutes um because there'll be
 
00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there'll be questions from the
 
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
from the U panel so if we can have up
 
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
Alex and R you guys here didn't go to
 
00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 align:start position:0%
the minutes thank you
 
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
do

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
can hit your butt got is that better
 
00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 align:start position:0%
there we go uh good morning members of
 
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
the commission Mr chairman uh my name is
 
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
Alex toia I'm the director of government
 
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
Affairs for artwolf Laboratories um we
 
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
are here today uh we thank you for the
 
00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share a little bit more
 
00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 align:start position:0%
about the importance of Laboratory
 
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
Testing in any cannabis program uh we're
 
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
here to be a resource to you um so we're
 
00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer any questions that
 
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
you might have we have a brief that the
 
00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
staff has provided to you uh just kind
 
00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 align:start position:0%
of going over all the different aspects
 
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
of Laboratory Testing some of the
 
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
lessons learned from other states um and
 
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
I myself am not a lab expert but I did
 
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
bring a subject matter expert with me uh
 
00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 align:start position:0%
he is our our director of labs uh for
 
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
artwolf Laboratories and he is ready to
 
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
take any questions that might have again
 
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
we thank you for this opportunity and we
 
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
hope to be um a good resource to you for
 
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
the the process that you're going
 
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 align:start position:0%
through and um we know it's going to be
 
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
a long process and and certainly not
 
00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 align:start position:0%
going to be over by December 1st uh but
 
00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
we want to continue to be able to
 
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
support you as you move forward uh Ron
 
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
and uh again thank you for having us and
 
00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
U the invitation to be here committee
 
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
members it's much appreciated I'm Ron
 
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
Brooks I'm as Alex said the lab expert
 
00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 align:start position:0%
for artwolf labs uh I've been involved
 
00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
in the legal cannabis industry since
 
00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
2018 uh but my background is in in
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
Laboratories even before that in
 
00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 align:start position:0%
clinical and reference uh laboratory
 
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
space so I've been around labs for a
 
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
um and any questions that you may have I
 
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
will do my best to answer and uh provide
 
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
any guidance because we we know science
 
00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
isn't always at the Forefront of all
 
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
this but it is definitely important for
 
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
um the safety of those in this state
 
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
that any legal product is tested so any
 
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
way we can help we're here to do so
 
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.949 align:start position:0%
way we can help we're here to do so
thank

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
you so I I'll just start the
 
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
conversation around um so lab testing
 
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
the conversation we had in the last
 
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
meeting was a state run model you know
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
State Labs versus third party
 
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
independent Labs can you talk a little
 
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
bit about how you how that works in
 
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
other states and and that kind of aspect
 
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
sure um happy to answer that question
 
00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
and and we did uh take a few notes from
 
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
the the last committee meeting or
 
00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
commission meeting and um definitely
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch on that uh States as you
 
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
know with with can all things cannabis
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
are doing everything a little bit
 
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
different um but there are some models
 
00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
that seem to be working um we do see a
 
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
lot of states have at least one
 
00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 align:start position:0%
Reference Lab I think um you know that's
 
00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 align:start position:0%
that's traditional and conventional
 
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
wisdom to have a spot checker on on
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
Independent third party Labs um we do
 
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
see a lot of success in some states
 
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
doing uh third party um Labs there's
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
also a lot of problems with that and
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
that gets down to the Regulation and
 
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
Licensing of those individual Labs uh
 
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
some of the uh requirements that they're
 
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
they're asked to do um as always in any
 
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
industry there's Bad actors um and some
 
00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 align:start position:0%
of the problems that that are inherently
 
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
arise from overregulation um does get
 
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
passed to labs and and creates a
 
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
conflict directly with some of the
 
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
Growers and producers when that's their
 
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
customers and they have a reason to to
 
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
want to please those customers so we we
 
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
do want to certainly um advise and and
 
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
share some of those insights and and as
 
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
I referenced in the policy document that
 
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
we shared with you a lot of examples of
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
of um those types of occurrences
 
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
happening um with lab shopping and and
 
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
really creating that Dynamic we do see
 
00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 align:start position:0%
some success with um with third party
 
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
vendors for States I think um as you
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
know in in New Hampshire and other
 
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
states sometimes going to a third party
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
for a vendor to get goods and services
 
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
can be a very successful model um as
 
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
long as you're holding that accountable
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
and in the RFP process you are ensuring
 
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
that the um the vendors are going to be
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
able to hold up to their side of the
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
contract successfully uh most recently
 
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
we did see in Oklahoma them divert from
 
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
that model where they had used a um a
 
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
third party vendor for their state
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
Reference Lab uh they had some problems
 
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
with that lab they weren't really happy
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
and satisfied with one what they were
 
00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
charging um which I can tell you was is
 
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
a little astronomical um but also with
 
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
their their service and their turnaround
 
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
time so they have decided to go the way
 
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
of in-housing a state lab um to do all
 
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
of the the testing and third-party um
 
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
checks on on the rest of the labs uh
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
that I think does bring some some
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
challenges um setting up a lab and Ron
 
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
can definitely go into some of the
 
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 align:start position:0%
details and the costs associated with it
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
is is quite expensive for the state to
 
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
do um and also with any state government
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
agency your adding a lot of overhead and
 
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0%
costs from state employees so we would
 
00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
probably not urge um New Hampshire go
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
that route and and housing a state lab
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
but I think a thirdparty vendor um at
 
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
least to to check independent
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
Laboratories would make sense and a
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
state the size of New Hampshire you
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
probably don't need um too many
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
independent State Labs I I know you guys
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
currently have one um that has been
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
sufficient for overseeing the the
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
current program um but I I think it
 
00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
would be wise to at least add an
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
additional lab um with the expansion
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
into adult recreational use um do you
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
have anything to add I would um I would
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
just like to concur what she said you
 
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
know most States we've seen with the
 
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
reference lab model Can Do Spot checks
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
you're seeing you know currently in
 
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
California their Department of cannabis
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
control has recently been stepping up
 
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement and uh recently sent letters
 
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
to um all the Laboratories saying that
 
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
they were checking their potency test
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
numbers to prevent against potency
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
inflation which has been rampant
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the industry but I would say
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
for the state you're looking you I would
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
say conservatively at a $5 million
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation to be able to outfit a lab
 
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
if you were going to do a full state run
 
00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:46.759 align:start position:0%
lab with the gamut of testing that um
 
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
typically would be required for Cannabis
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
Testing um so with that you know it in
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
my opinion I think it would be more
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the state to be able to
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
Outsource to a third
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
party thank you so you referenced
 
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma so it sounds like what they did
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
was they have a license for third party
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
independent Labs at the manufacturers
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
and the cultivators could could go to
 
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.080 align:start position:0%
direct to get their lab reports to
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
submit to the state and then on top of
 
00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
that they have an A the state itself
 
00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
contracted with a lab which I assume is
 
00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
ex can't be one of these other labs that
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
that are doing testing to do
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
specifically testing for the state to
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
validate the lab the third party Labs
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
that uh grower manufacturers are using
 
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
that's correct so they they did go that
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
route um and you're absolutely correct
 
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
if the if the vendor is contracted with
 
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
the state they are unable to do any
 
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
direct testing for Growers um and
 
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
producers uh that's that's a great check
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh you want to make sure that there's
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
not that that um uh interference
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
potentially between um between that spot
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
check but they have decided in this past
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
legislative session to inhouse that lab
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
um like I said they I think they were
 
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
probably contracted was is the wrong
 
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
vendor um I I believe I saw that it was
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
costing over $10 million a year to
 
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
contract with that vendor which is
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
actually insane um and so they were able
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
when they did their fiscal impact report
 
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
to say that they could bring that cost
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
down significantly for the state by
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
in-housing a lab which is true on its
 
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
surface um and and like Ron said to get
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
a a state-of-the-art lab up and running
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
to do all the tests that you need to to
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
have done for product safety Consumer
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
safety Public Safety um it it will be
 
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
about at least $5 billion appropriation
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
on the onset and then the ongoing cost
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
of of running that lab so um that's just
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
the route that they're going right now
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
they're in the process of standing that
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
up um I give a lot of credit to to
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma uh medical marijuana Authority
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
they have been uh really grappling with
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
a with getting some control on the
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
medical program that they have when they
 
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
first um open that program a few years
 
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
back they kind of just opened the doors
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
on it and so they've spent the last
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
couple of years trying to get that under
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
control um they do have a lot of
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
third-party Labs that are licensed with
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
the state um a good chunk of them are
 
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
not operational um are not in compliance
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
um and have you know various issues
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
Chief among them usually is uh cash flow
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
that ends up shutting them down so um
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're doing what they
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
can to kind of get their hands around
 
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
them I again I don't think that inh
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
housing a state lab is the best way to
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
to go um you know when it comes to to
 
00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
state Laboratories we we know that they
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
usually have their hands full with
 
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with um violent crimes and and
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
all of the investigative work that needs
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
to happen there and we feel that
 
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis is is something that needs to
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
be outside of that um and not a
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
distraction because it does take up a
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
lot of time and
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
effort thank you um representative
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
kahill then representative o thank you
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so can you speak to like how
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
your third these third party Labs like
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
is there an accreditation program that
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
they're going through like who who Who's
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
responsible for that and you know I I um
 
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
I spent some time working in an army
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
research lab and we had like thorough
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
accreditation programs for for what we
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
were working on and it just like you to
 
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
speak to that yes that's a great
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
question um in Most states uh most
 
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
Cannabis Testing Labs if not all are ISO
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
17025 accredited so have to go through
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
that accreditation process through an
 
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
accreditation body meaning that they
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
have a quality management system in
 
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
place that all their Sops are defined
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
and they can be checked they have to
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
keep up with non-conformance issues uh
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
have quality controls through their
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
testing with each batch that happens
 
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
multiple quality controls for each
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.069 --> 00:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
um is there a length of time that the
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
they have to store their data on um like
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
like five years 20 years or how long are
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
they required to keep their data on um
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
that can range um I've seen as little as
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
seven represent Val thank you Mr chair
 
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the figure of $5 million
 
00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
and then you mentioned an ISO
 
00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
requirement now the iso requirements is
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
from my understanding because they apply
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
apply only to private entities not
 
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
necessarily to State entities
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
correct um if I'm
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh based on ISO any laboratory could
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
become ISO accredited so the state
 
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
laboratory if they chose could pursue
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
that route okay um however they yeah
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
however having an ISO uh
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
certification by a state entity does not
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
detract from the state's entity to
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
present evidence today M even with the
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
existence of a national standard or
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
actually International
 
00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
standard for preventing uh presenting
 
00:13:11.199 --> 00:13:12.629 align:start position:0%
standard for preventing uh presenting
evidence

00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:14.389 align:start position:0%
evidence
regarding

00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
whatever uh in a court of law so the the
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
iso stand uh standing is not uh
 
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.790 align:start position:0%
iso stand uh standing is not uh
necessarily

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
required where did you come up with the
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
$5 million cost to New Hampshire were
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
already doing
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
it the $5 million cost would be starting
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
a lab essentially from the ground up um
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
the cost of Capital Equipment uh plus
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
buildout and all the infrastructure and
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
even smaller equipment necessary to be
 
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
able to do the
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
testing okay we got some more on the
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
side so yeah I'm just the last one so
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
that would be to start from scratch so
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
that has no application since we already
 
00:13:58.990 --> 00:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
have testing facility in in in New
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at the state
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
lab the question then would be if under
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
the plan that we brought
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
forward the state La would be testing
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
the testers do you have an estimate of
 
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.749 align:start position:0%
the testers do you have an estimate of
the

00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
cost that would depend on the equipment
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
currently in place with the state lab
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
and the capabilities of that equipment
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to do the requisite tested
 
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.829 align:start position:0%
to be able to do the requisite tested
testing

00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
needed and may I just provide a quick
 
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
clarification when we the the $5 million
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
um number that wasn't for the State of
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's just the experience
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
that we have had in building out a lab
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
um so I certainly don't want to to pin
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
that number down for you guys or have
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to put something out
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
there so there's a basic understanding
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
of the cost of the equipment that goes
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
into these Labs we're currently um in
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
the process of building out a lab in
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
Moss Point uh Mississippi and you know
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
we we had really thought it was going to
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
be closer to $3 million and by the time
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
you get all the state-of-the-art
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
equipment necessary to to have full
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
compliance for cannabis that number does
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
creep up quite a bit um to to about $5
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
million once you get all the equipment
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
in place so to be clear the $5 million
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
assumes no lab existed so the real cost
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
is going to be somewhere between zero
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
and five million depending on what the
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
expansion we may have to do for the
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
increased testing and number of
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
personnel and that kind of stuff along
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
yeah along with Personnel yeah so all
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
right down here great thank you Mr chair
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you for being here with
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
this important uh testimony I do have a
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
question uh cannabis is widely
 
00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
misperceived as being a harmless green
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
plant um aside from the from the high
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
potency THC and the hes associated with
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
that when we think about toxins and and
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
um pesticides and things along that line
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious it you know in
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
recreational um marijuana uh you know
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
distribution is there such a thing as
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
organic uh cannabis
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
um I I'll let Ron answer that question
 
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519 align:start position:0%
because I I think some sometimes we get
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
really caught up in in questions about
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
potency and um you know whether it's
 
00:16:11.949 --> 00:16:11.959 align:start position:0%
harmful or it's not um I think from what
 
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
I've read from what I've understood and
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
from what I've learned from Ron uh the
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
more harmful things are some of the
 
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
heavy metals and the pesticides that get
 
00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
into the product during cultivation um
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
and just for the record I do want to
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
state that we are a Cannabis Testing
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
company uh but we are agnostic to
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
legalization and I know the charge of
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
this commission is is not to uh question
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not it should be legal but
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
really how do how do you move forward in
 
00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
implementing a program so you know we're
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
not here today to advocate for the
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
safety um and the the um the
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of cannabis but just re
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
really saying if it's going to be legal
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
it needs to be tested it needs to be
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
safe for public um consumption but Ron
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
do you want to answer that and as far as
 
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
organic if you look at actual USDA
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
organic standards um one cannabis based
 
00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
on definition can't be USDA organic but
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
if you look at the list of pesticides
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
that most say organic produce is tested
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
for and compare that to say the
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
pesticide testing list of a a California
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
or a Mississippi um a lot of that
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
product will actually be cleaner than
 
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
USDA organic produce um but the reason
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
for that is when you combust these
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
potential pesticides and things that
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
could be on this um one pesticide in
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
particular mic mobinil um can turn into
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
hydrogen cyanide um that could
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
potentially kill someone but with usdaa
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
organic produce you're ingesting so the
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
body can break down or it simply passes
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
through the system whereas if you are
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
combusting a product due to the
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
limitations of research in this country
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
because of the National Institutes of
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
drug abuse standards uh we don't know
 
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
what happens when you combust these on
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis material so um it's um I would
 
00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
say most beneficial to have a very
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
stringent testing regime when it comes
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
to things like pesticides and heavy
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
metals to ensure if a consumer wants to
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
partake of this product that they are
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
partaking of a product that's clean and
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
as safe as possible for the research
 
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
that we currently have okay thank you so
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
just one question I'm not sure if you
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
provided this this this Canadian list of
 
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
all the chemicals and the pesticides
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
that are tested for in Labs under the
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
Canadian model is that is that an
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list um but you know is there
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
has this been modified so it looks like
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's a 2018 document the Canadian list
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
is a very extensive model and it's it's
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
more extensive than most of the the
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
actually most all of the states
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
currently in the US that have a
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
legalized model be it medical or
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
recreational and one one follow the the
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
um quantities that they're talking about
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
for for how much is is found in a given
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
product are those again are those
 
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
besides the number of products they're
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
number of um ingredients they're looking
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
for is the quantity again of these
 
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
levels normal I mean when I say normal
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
other states are looking at for what if
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
if they're listed or do you know if it's
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
more restringing um can I ask for
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
clarification is that like an action
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
limit set for a um I'm guessing it's a
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's a trigger marker right so yes so um
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
I would have to look at that document
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
particularly to be able to tell you each
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
state does treat different pesti sides
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
or residual solvents a bit differently
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
um even within this state with your
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
current medical program seeing the
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
action limits for your heavy medals um
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
to me is actually quite surprising
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
because it's quite High compared to some
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
of the other states that I've helped
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
groups set um Labs um up for other
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
Medical Systems
 
00:19:50.909 --> 00:19:50.919 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
Che yes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh for your testimony so uh point of
 
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
clarification so is it fair to say that
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
that in your uh in your testimony that
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
you would recommend that a testing
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
regime include a third-party vendor that
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
would be certified by the state to
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
specific standards with a uh separate
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
verification or Reference Lab either uh
 
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
by state run or by um a vendor is would
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
that be
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
correct I think so yes okay so uh and
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me followup followup yes um so
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
would it also be fair to say then that
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh if you could say based on your
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
experience and knowledge in the testing
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh industry uh and in the market what is
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
your um opinion if you can offer one
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
with respect to the percentage of states
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
that have state operated reference
 
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
Laboratories versus states that have
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
legalized and use a third-party vendor
 
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
opinion um I would have to get back to
 
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
you on that I don't know the specific
 
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
number off the top of my head of states
 
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
that employ either model follow up Mr
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
chair uh if you were to uh
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
recommend uh the difference between a
 
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
state uh operated Reference Lab versus a
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
third-party vendor Reference Lab um what
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
would you recommend based on your
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
experience um and knowledge in the
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
industry based on my experience I would
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
recommend a third-party lab um and I
 
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
think with a state this size um you
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
would be able to work more in
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
conjunction with having a thirdparty lab
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
like that um and and use their expertise
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
to benefit the state followup Mr chair
 
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
um are you familiar with um some
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
open-source testing of California um
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
retail cannabis that was done by various
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
media Outlets that discovered
 
00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
significant presence of toxins
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
particularly heavy metals and pesticides
 
00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
in the U California retail stores were
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
you aware of
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
that oh could you say when the study was
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
um there have been multiple um checks in
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
California recently
 
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
the the most recent uh data that I have
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh started uh in the early 2000s with
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
followup spot checks that occurred in uh
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
2011 that would be quite a quite an old
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
study and I would say based on my
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
experience from having operated a a
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
Cannabis Testing Lab in California that
 
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
the products that I signed off on as as
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
the signatory on the C ofas we had very
 
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
few heavy metal failures once the
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
program in California became um it
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
became necessary to do heavy metals
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
testing for um both medical and
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
recreational Cannabis follow up Mr
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
chair can you offer an opinion based on
 
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
your knowledge of the population and
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
projected size of the retail industry
 
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
for cannabis in New Hampshire what the
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
cost would be to the state to
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
um operate of u a well-regulated
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
testing uh regime for both uh industry
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
testing as well as reference testing if
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
you can offer an opinion as the
 
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
cost and that would be based on uh your
 
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation for third-party
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.110 align:start position:0%
 
Laboratory

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
yeah um as far as a specific dollar
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
number I don't think I could give you
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
one but you would have the you know
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing cost with with staff um as well
 
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
as you know the necessary chemicals the
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
reagents the analytical standards um
 
00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:17.559 align:start position:0%
that are necessary to be able to do all
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
this testing these standards um for
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
example for as small as a 1 mil ampule
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
for say a cannabinoid standard could
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
cost you $0000 um so when you start to
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
multiply that out and as frequently as
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
that's used um the cost depending on the
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
size and the frequency of runs and also
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
your number of employees um could start
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
to go up do you want to talk a little
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
bit about clarification Mr chair sure go
 
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
ahead follow um my my question I think
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
goes more toward uh based on your
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
opinion and uh operation of Laboratory
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
is that that test cannabis what
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
generally would be the cost to the state
 
00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh on a contract annual basis for
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
example to run both a testing laboratory
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
contract and then a second independent
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
Reference Laboratory contract if you can
 
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
offer such opinion as to the cost not
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
state run this would be um
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
independent so Chief I'm I'm just going
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
to give a look a little bit of a
 
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
clarification just on the legislative
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
process part of this is going to be
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
based on what we decide the number of
 
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
tests that are required how many batches
 
00:25:37.389 --> 00:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
how many tests it's awful hard as we
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten deep into that standard
 
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
or or even had uh liquor give us what
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
that standard would look like to even
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
guess what the price would be so just
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
just I'm just trying to you know they're
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
they're you're asking for a number based
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
on unknown facts that they don't have
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
get there that could vary greatly
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
depending I know in your current
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
regulation it says that that um test for
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis products are quarterly Most
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
states require test based on each batch
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
and there's a maximum batch size in
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
California you can have up to a 50 lb
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
Harvest batch of cannabis flour in
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
Mississippi that's 25 lbs in Nevada it's
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
10 pounds so depending
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
upon how often um as the senator said uh
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
would be required to test and those
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
batch limits and whatnot that would
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
affect the cost to State thank you Mr
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
chair I appreciate um the clarification
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
and that was actually what I was trying
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
to get to which is uh trying to have um
 
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
the folks provide us with uh perhaps
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
their knowledge with respect to testing
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
and what what that looks like and so my
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
question now is is it fair to say then
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
that there's not really no industry
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
standard right based on States uh in
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
terms of batch size which varies greatly
 
00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
with respect to cost so it could vary
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
based on the lower batch size which
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
would perhaps um provide a greater uh
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
quality standard uh as opposed to a
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
larger badge size with representative
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
samples that would diminish the
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for obtaining uh qualified
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
test that would detect toxins heavy
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
metals or pesticides would that be fair
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
to say yes it would be okay thank you
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
thank you so I want last simple question
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can get to a number the
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
chief might like so I think you said
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
Alabama was does a 25 pound batch of
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
flower Mississippi I'm sorry Mississippi
 
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
does a 20 pound 25 pound batch sampling
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh and testing on a given sample like
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
that is there an estimated cost that
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
would would that we would know what
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
would it cost uh a lab to be able to
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
process on 20 that 25lb batch sample to
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
to test for all of the heavy metals all
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
of the car cens all of the um mold and
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
all the other things what what would it
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
cost again the cost to the lab to
 
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
actually perform the testing um would
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
depend one on how much your
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
instrumentation cost is um and also what
 
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
specifically is required for the testing
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
so if you have a quite large pesticide
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
panel the cost would be more than say if
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
you had a panel similar to that from
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma which is quite limited can you
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
a what of a ballpark trying trying to
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
get to that's what I knew you were about
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
to get to thank Mr exactly where I was
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
going to give you an actual number um we
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
base a lot of our modeling in in the
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
labs and in the national average right
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
now for full panel testing again it's
 
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
dependent on every state because they
 
00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
require different things about $450 to
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
the grower the producer getting the test
 
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
done by the private lab by the the
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
independent lab so about
 
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
$450 per sample is the cost of of
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
getting that tested thank you um I can
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
also provide if it is helpful um what
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact report was for for
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma when they were looking at doing
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
the Reference Lab in housee and and for
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
the state if that's a helpful number
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
just to kind of give um a ballpark of
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
what it might look like for a state like
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'd be happy to provide
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
that one more question Mr chair um when
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
you referen the the uh Quebec uh
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
pesticide mandatory uh Cannabis Testing
 
00:29:28.509 --> 00:29:28.519 align:start position:0%
for pesticide and and we can provide
 
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
this with you and your testimony
 
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
indicated that it was more extensive
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
than other states uh to your knowledge
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
can you offer an opinion as to why the
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
Canadians who probably have the most
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
experience with legalization of cannabis
 
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh a nationwide program
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
would have a more extensive list than
 
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
what US states have put in
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
place I think that is a question that
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
comes down to the policy makers in the
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
US that have DEC ided the list and and
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
as you can see you know a state like
 
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
California has a a um very extensive
 
00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:06.919 align:start position:0%
list I think there are some 64 65
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
pesticides on that list um so that's one
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
of the closest to the Canadian list but
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
I I I can't say that I I don't disagree
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
with the Canadian list being extensive I
 
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
think the more we test the safer that we
 
00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:26.519 align:start position:0%
can provide a product to uh the consumer
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
um so I do I think that that list is
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily Overkill no
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
um it just again it varies state byst
 
00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
state based on you know agricultural
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
practices things like that thank
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
you representative or thank you Mr chair
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
um it was mentioned a 25 pound sample of
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
flour okay the several sections to this
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
what would be a sample size for each of
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
the different types of of materials that
 
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.230 align:start position:0%
the different types of of materials that
are

00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
available uh that's a great question we
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
could provide some examples of that from
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
other states um so as far as a
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative sample from that 25 pound
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
batch um normally a lab would to do a
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative sampling would take a
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
small percentage say anywhere from 0.25
 
00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.029 align:start position:0%
small percentage say anywhere from 0.25
to

00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
0.5% of that 25 pounds into the into the
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
lab to do testing if it's on a finished
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
product based so say a an edible product
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
or a cartridge then you're going to have
 
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
different based on how many units are
 
00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
produced you would take a certain amount
 
00:31:38.679 --> 00:31:40.110 align:start position:0%
produced you would take a certain amount
of

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
um uh units to be able to do the
 
00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:44.310 align:start position:0%
um uh units to be able to do the
requisite

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
requisite
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
testing follow units y units so I'm
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
going to ask you for a homework
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
assignment because I send to hand those
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
out regularly um would it be possible
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
for you to to generate for us a
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
contaminant list and a trigger and the
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
trigger level um similar to the Canadian
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
what what you see in other states and
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
what's going on and give us a reasonable
 
00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:05.799 align:start position:0%
contaminant list with trigger levels and
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
the second thing I'm going to ask you
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
for is the sample size that they're
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative in a given batch what's
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
your recommendation for what's the bit
 
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
batch of flour batch of Edibles batch of
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
whatever those products right what that
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
what sample size would you recommend to
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
to do the testing from we would be happy
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
you yeah this is more of a question for
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
us so under our current plan that we're
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
we're our draft are are we responsible
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
for creating that list or is this
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
something that would fall under under
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
liquor I guess my reason for asking is
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
either or right so if it ends up
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
something we want to put in the statute
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
for all the contaminate list and we can
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
do that it makes it harder for the
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
director to modify that later on or it
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
may just be a sample of we've got it we
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
can hand it over to them and they can
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
write their rules and regulations based
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
on that but it'd be nice to have the
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
information for the
 
00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:57.669 align:start position:0%
information for the
discussion

00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
anything else thank you guys very much
 
00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
you next up we have Lynn Sila from
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
start thank you chairman Lang members of
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
the commission it's an honor to be here
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
with you this morning um I was asked to
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
prepare a slightly longer presentation
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
if that's okay okay
 
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
um my name is Dr Lynn silver I'm a
 
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
pediatrician uh senior adviser at the
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
Public Health Institute and um full
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
professor at the University of
 
00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:42.919 align:start position:0%
California San Francisco for better for
 
00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
worse I've got about four Decades of
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
experience in public health policy often
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh working on issues of regulation of
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
legal but harmful substances uh since
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
shortly before the passage of
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
proposition 64 which legalized
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis use in California
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
I founded an oversee uh getting it right
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
from the start initiative our Focus has
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
been to work where cannabis has been or
 
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
is being legalized uh to identify
 
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
potential best practices to protect
 
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
children Public Health and Social Equity
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh we carry out extensive research
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
supported by NIH and other funders to
 
00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
assess cannabis policy impact on health
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
to develop tools and model laws um for
 
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919 align:start position:0%
local government and Community Partners
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
um and with Foundation support we Prov
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
provided technical assistance to
 
00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
Partners in over 100 California cities
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
and counties 15 states and some other
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
countries um for the 27 US states which
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
have not yet legalized recreational
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
Cannabis we believe that there is an
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn and greatly improve
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
what is being done by States if they do
 
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
uh decide to move forward the governor's
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
office invited me to come uh to New
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and share some of our findings
 
00:34:56.109 --> 00:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
and Lessons Learned to help inform your
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
challenging decision- making the sort of
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
top 10 um first let me say that I am not
 
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
here to tell you whether to legalize or
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
not uh there are very good arguments to
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
be made for and against I'm here to
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
share with you ways that if you do
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
decide to move forward you can reduce
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
harms from legalization and better
 
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
protect children uh first I'll try and
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
share just a few facts on the health
 
00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
impacts of non-medical Canabis use what
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers are seeing and then
 
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
talk about some key strategies to reduce
 
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
these arms if you choose to move
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
forward um I've shared some materials
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
summarizing key points and some slides
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
and pictures of products from California
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
but I won't be reading through them um I
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
come at this problem as a pediatrician
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
public health professional who spend her
 
00:35:45.069 --> 00:35:45.079 align:start position:0%
life trying to find ways to prevent
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
illness before it happens and someone
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
who's been studying the Cannabis
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
industry for the past seven years but I
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
also come to it as a mother and stepmom
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
of five um and lastly someone who uh
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
love somebody who developed psychosis
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
and schizophrenia um so preventing every
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
case of serious mental illness is some
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
that is preventable not all of them are
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
um but some are is very personal uh to
 
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
me um so let's talk briefly about health
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
effects the product New Hampshire is
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
deciding how to treat is not the
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
Botanical plant um from the days of my
 
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
college days or or most of yours um that
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
joint your mama may have rolled had
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
about 3 to 5%
 
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh THC in it it got you high but only
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
rarely did it make people seriously ill
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years the United States
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
cannabis Market has become something
 
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
completely different uh changes in
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
agriculture and um and and growing um
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
procedures um have led to flour that is
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
5 to 10 times stronger currently at
 
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
about 20 to 35% THC and a vast array of
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
manufactured aggressively marketed
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
flashily packaged inhal able
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
concentrates and Edibles as well as
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
so-called but still intoxicating hemp
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
products has emerged many are 80 90 to
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
100% THC including these hemp products
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
um some imitate McFlurries Cocoa Pebbles
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
nachos or Skittles uh as you can see in
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
the pictures of some legal California
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
products that I included in in your
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
package that we've been trying
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
unsuccessfully frankly to get off the
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
market in
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
California um my colleague Professor
 
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
Carini and in Washington notes that
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
today's products are to Botanical
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis with strawberry Pop-Tarts are
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
to strawberries or I would say what
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
Coca-Cola is to a beet plant I call it
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
the coca-c isation of cannabis um we are
 
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
um a country that is very good at and
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
Incredibly creative at marketing things
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
and that can be a really good thing in
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
some sectors um but in this particular
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
case it is not necessarily the case so
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
why most people can still get high at a
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
party without ill effects and many enjoy
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
that a growing minority of consumers do
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
not get off so easy between one and two
 
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
out of every 10 users are developing
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
dependency that's more frequent the
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
younger they start vaping cannabis by
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
12th graders has tripled nationally
 
00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
since 2017 often occurring before or at
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
school disrupting education many schools
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
are not letting kids go to the bathroom
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
during class uh because they're seeing
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
so much vaping in the bathroom daily use
 
00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
in young adults nationally has tripled
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
um and that means that today
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
approximately one in0 American 19 to 30y
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
olds is walking around High almost every
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
day um and a whole lot of high school
 
00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
students so those are not good
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
statistics for learning or for
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
productivity ask any school principal
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
what they are
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
seeing uh daily use of cannabis above
 
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
10% THC which is pretty much the entire
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
US market um is associated with a three
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
to fivefold increase in the risk of
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
psychosis a problem that we all know
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
that as a society we are facing great
 
00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
challenges managing and one that is
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
filling our streets with people with
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
poorly controlled serious mental illness
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
the current estimates are that perhaps
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
12 to 15% of nuon said psychosis cases
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
may be uh cannabis triggered
 
00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
particularly with the frequent use of
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
high potency products uh like Vapes dabs
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
waxes and shatters resin um the numbers
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
vary a bit by study but they are not
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
smaller in significant here's what one
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
PR pediatric provider said in our latest
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
research study I can think of three or
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
four kids off the top of my head in the
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
last five months who were actually
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
psychotic I was trying to talk to them
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
and they were yeah they were psychotic
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
drug induced psychosis that we didn't
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
used to see so much um sometimes this
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
can be reversed if the person or their
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
doctor understands what's going on in
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
some children or young or typically
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
young adults these can be irreversible
 
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
breaks initiating long-term um
 
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia we know now that uh
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis use is also associated with
 
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
increases in suicidality mood disorders
 
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
car accidents and probably heart attacks
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
even though many consumers use it
 
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:14.839 align:start position:0%
believing Mis misleading industry
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
messaging that it is a safe stress
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
relever um poisonings of young children
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
are up, 1400% nationally cannabis ER
 
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
visits in California by seniors Rose by8
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
00% in a decade um cannabis use
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
interferes with adolescent cognition and
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
the likelihood of graduating high
 
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.710 align:start position:0%
the likelihood of graduating high
school

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
um so as a pediatrician of great concern
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
to me and this is wrapping up health
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
effects is used during pregnancy where
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
it is not only associated with low birth
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
weight and prematurity but also with
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
long-term neurological harms and
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
psychopathology and children exposed in
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
utero according to the recent uh major
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
NIH study which is looking at how teen
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
cognition is developing in the United
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
States and what's affecting it so we're
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
seeing something similar to fetal
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
alcohol syndrome in some children who
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
are exposed in utera um these are bells
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
that an exposed child cannot unring and
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
which may affect the course of their
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
life and yet cannabis use in pregnancy
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
has nearly doubled in California and
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
risen nationally exposing the next
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
generation of children to more harm
 
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
these are Health harms not from an
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
occasional study but as concluded by the
 
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
nationaly of science they're summarized
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
in page two of your packet um for these
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
reasons I was very pleased to hear
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
governor cuno and this body have been
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
examining a Fresh Approach of a state
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
controlled cannabis system with the goal
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
of reaping some of the benefits of
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
legalization and less of the harms a
 
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
smarter approach let's examine what some
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
of the pillars of such a system might
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
look like what are the guard rails as
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned that needs to be put
 
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
in that need to be put in place place
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
and cannot be left for last as some
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
states have done first on criminal
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
justice uh I believe that one of the
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
strongest Arguments for decriminalizing
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
has been the long standing history of
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
discriminatory arrests and incarceration
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
and we need to address these I know the
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
state has taken some important steps um
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
according to the ACLU in 2018 blacks in
 
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire were still four-fold more
 
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
likely to have a marijuana possession
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
arrest although I've been told that
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
arrests are now weighed down um this
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed but you don't need to
 
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
create a giant for-profit industry to
 
00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:34.839 align:start position:0%
fix this um by decriminalizing
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
smallscale possession further um and
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
creating and funding the process for
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
automatic expungement of criminal
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
records associated with non-violent
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis possession much of that past
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
and future inequity can be relieved uh
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
California has now expunged 93% of
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
eligible convictions with huge benefit
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
for over 200,000 people that is very
 
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
feasible you can do that today no matter
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
where you go with legalization so that
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
people who got caught with a joint in
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
the past can get scholarships and
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
housing and face fewer obstacles in life
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
we also recommend that penalties for
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
miners um include community service or
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
Noni non- fine options to avoid civil
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
debt trap from fines for miners um who
 
00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.079 align:start position:0%
may be caught with uh with cannabis
 
00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
possession but in our understanding the
 
00:43:28.349 --> 00:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
real future danger to the health of New
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents comes not from a few
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
plants or even from pesticide residues
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
it comes from what happens when you
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
build a Powerhouse of agricultural
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
industrial and Retail interests that
 
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
profit from a harmful and addictive drug
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
in short from building a new tobacco
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
industry my parents were small business
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
people and I grew up helping in the
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
family store um but cannabis is not
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
clothes or potatoes cannabis is no
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
ordinary commodity like tobacco you
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
don't want it or hemp to be the growth
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
engine of the New Hampshire economy you
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
may choose to allow it but more is not
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
better because whatever revenue or jobs
 
00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
it generates will be heavily offset by
 
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
health care and social expenditures by
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
more people with expensive and
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
devastating mental illness some of who
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
end up in jail premature babies young
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
children with uh problems more car
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
accidents the burden of these harms will
 
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
not be equitably
 
00:44:28.359 --> 00:44:30.630 align:start position:0%
not be equitably
distributed

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
um I did some calculations on psychosis
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
I can share them with you later but my
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
general point is don't get star eyed
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
with Revenue projections from private
 
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:42.559 align:start position:0%
operators or franchises if you do this
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
wrong and create an industry that drives
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
up consumption and the more serious
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
adverse effects you'll essentially be
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
robbing Peter to pay Paul um for every
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
dollar in taxes you'll spend one or two
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
on psychiatric beds or rehab units so
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
that leads me to the fundamental
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
conclusion either Don't Legalize
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
commercial sales and live with the
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
ambiguity of decriminalization uh as the
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
Dutch and the Portuguese do um which can
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
be okay or legalize with a very
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
different approach one that says we will
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
allow legal sale but only in a very
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
careful system whose specified goal is
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
to provide legal access more safely but
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
without driving up consumption one that
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
expressly seeks to avoid a new big
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
tobacco the data suggest to me that one
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
of the best examples of safer
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis is in Quebec
 
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
your neighbor to the north which
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
piggybacked on its existing public
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
alcohol system to create an exclusive
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
provincially owned and operated cannabis
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
retail system it operates attractive
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
stores and provides online access and
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
collects Revenue significant Revenue but
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't aggressively advertise uh
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
cannabis except how people can get it
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
legally and wear and it strongly limits
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
the types of products sold to avoid the
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
more dangerous H High potency
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
concentrates flavored Vapes like Jewel
 
00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
which are widely sold in California for
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis and products that are obviously
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
going to attract children Quebec has had
 
00:46:08.589 --> 00:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
the same high transition to the legal
 
00:46:11.349 --> 00:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
Market as other provinces uh but less
 
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
growth in population consumption levels
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
and high public satisfaction they've
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
generated profitable margins that go to
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
the state fund and use of the more
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous High potency products are low
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
relative to other provinces most
 
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
fascinating is that according to
 
00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
marijuana Business Daily recently uh
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
they are the most economically
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
successful cannabis businesses in Canada
 
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
so the publicly operated ones in Canada
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
are actually doing better than most of
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
the private sector uh some of this data
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
is in your packets so can we do this in
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
the United States um in the US where
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
cannabis remains federally illegal there
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
are concerns and legitimate concerns
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
about public employees and I imagine the
 
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is worried about this
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh there were concerns about public
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
employees running running a business
 
00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
that's still federally illegal um the
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
public health law Center in Minnesota
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
studied this issue and identified some
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
potential workarounds um one is
 
00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:08.559 align:start position:0%
specifically to use an exclusive state
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
license or Contracting process with a
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofit to manage the system so you're
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
kind of creating a a distance uh of the
 
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
state from the process why still
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
exercising uh considerable control
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
similar to the way that we might um
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
issue a permit to an exclusive Regional
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
electric provider um only with a
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
nonprofit um in this way you can write
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
strong terms to protect Youth and reduce
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
harms both in law and in the permitting
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
or contractual process you can more
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
broadly restrict marketing than you can
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
in law because of First Amendment
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
concerns profits from this system can be
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
channeled back to support substance use
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
prevention Youth and Community reinvest
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
and Community reinvestment hiring can be
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
Equity focused um The Liquor Commission
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
could for example incubate and create a
 
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit and share its board which is
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
an approach we took when I was in New
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
York government to create a nonprofit
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
for medication access um or could use an
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
existing nonprofit I don't know New
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well enough to um say how you
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
should do that um I believe however in
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
contrast that the proposed franchise
 
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
system like McDonald's and other
 
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
franchise uh franchises would still be
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
run by franchisees whose logical and
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
natural Mission would be to maximize
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
their sales and
 
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
profitability um and that that should
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
not be the mission of a legal cannabis
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
system so I recommend that you seek a
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
state um organized not for-profit
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
approach um through exclusive permit or
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
other mechanisms rather than um
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
franchising for-profit
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
organizations another um aspect to look
 
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
at is retail density uh in our research
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
we've studied uh pregnant use by
 
00:48:59.309 --> 00:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
pregnant women and by teens and we find
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
it directly proportional to how many
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
retailers there are within a 15minute
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
drive from uh the person's house uh you
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
have it pretty close to write on public
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
alcohol Stores um in the state if it's
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
enough to provide whiskey it's enough to
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
provide weed you may need less um but
 
00:49:20.109 --> 00:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
you certainly don't need more Stores um
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
we generally recommend not having more
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
than one per 20,000 inhabitants or so um
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
it takes a while to get there it's okay
 
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
keep them far away from schools and
 
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
colleges and also from residential areas
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
I recommend you don't promise to open
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
them all overnight because so many
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
states have gotten into trouble with
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
Promises of excessive speed and that was
 
00:49:42.359 --> 00:49:43.230 align:start position:0%
Promises of excessive speed and that was
not

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
feasible conflicts of interests
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interests should be
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
strongly prohibited this is one of the
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
worst characteristics of what's happened
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
around the country we would not let the
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
tobacco industry write the regulations
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
for tobacco and we should not be letting
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis industry write the
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
regulations for cannabis you want to
 
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
have some organization that melds
 
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
management proficiency with public
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
health and substance abuse expertise not
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
one that views its Mission as promoting
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
and growing the Cannabis industry as
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible you should have an
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
oversight body that approves regulations
 
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
that's composed of scientists doctors
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
Educators law enforcement and economists
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
but with no direct Financial interest in
 
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:28.839 align:start position:0%
the industry no one in the regulatory
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
system should have
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
conflicts that's not to say that the
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
industry does not have indispensable and
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
Essential Knowledge to contribute to how
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
you write regulations they should have a
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
voice and there should be a robust
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
mechanism for public input um but they
 
00:50:46.109 --> 00:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
should not be controlling the
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
process once you get started there's a
 
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:51.640 align:start position:0%
number of other areas to think about the
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
first is products what products should
 
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
be sold in reality the health harms of
 
00:50:59.230 --> 00:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis are determined far more by what
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
is intentionally put in the product than
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
by accidental contaminants or residues
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
so why lab testing is important the type
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
defining the type of allowable products
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
is actually far more
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
important um the regulatory body should
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
focus uh from the start on only allowing
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
a restricted and lower risk and lower
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
potency range of products we do not need
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
99% THC shatter for dabbing or wax pens
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
States like Connecticut and New Jersey
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
as well as Quebec and ugay have all
 
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
imposed potency caps other states New
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
York and Illinois for example tax by THC
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
content to discourage the higher THC uh
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
products you can also do that through
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
pricing if you start very cautiously you
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
can always decide to loosen up over time
 
00:51:51.309 --> 00:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
what is exceedingly difficult to do is
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
if you allow a product to then come back
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
and pull it off the market that becomes
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
almost in part uh
 
00:51:58.990 --> 00:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
impossible I would say if you're going
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
to invest thinking of the the previous
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh testimony if you're going to invest
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
State money invested in enforcement in
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
creating a a cautious system um and then
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
regulating products very carefully and
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
that will bring more public health and
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
safety return than building uh your own
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
lab for example which can be a very high
 
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.789 align:start position:0%
lab for example which can be a very high
capital

00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:20.799 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
investment um start with lower potency
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
flow and Ables and either don't allow
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
concentrates for the first 3 years or
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
cap the THC content for example at
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
40% um have the oversight commission
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
specifically evaluate what happens the
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
industry is going to say oh you're just
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
going to push people to the illicit
 
00:52:42.789 --> 00:52:42.799 align:start position:0%
market for these products um but in
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
Quebec that wasn't what happened um if
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
as in Quebec it keeps overall use of
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
high potency products down then may be a
 
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
good decision if it doesn't then you
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
might need to adjust but just calling
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
that with the exception of hash and some
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
other traditional concentrates most of
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
these turbocharged products uh didn't
 
00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:04.799 align:start position:0%
even exist uh very long a few few years
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
back um if you know High potency product
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
use is rising then you can re-evaluate
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
also I would note that the allowable
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
amounts for a person to hold and
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
allowable doses should be much lower
 
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
than what are in in the draft they're
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
much higher than in other states I have
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
never seen a 20 mgram as the standard
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
serving dose anywhere the ni and others
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
recommend 5 Mig California uses 10 Mig
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh 20 milligrams will get an
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
inexperienced user to stoned um and
 
00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:35.559 align:start position:0%
guidelines recommend that people start
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
with just a couple of milligrams Most
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
states allow and Canada allow 1 ounce um
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
although some have larger um home
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
amounts I want to talk for a minute
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
about hemp um because these are the same
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
plant and we can't pretend that they're
 
00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:55.799 align:start position:0%
not um regulation should I ideally be
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
integrated with hemp regulation to
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
ensure that intoxicating hemp products
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
are not being sold period the 0.3% THC
 
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
by weight criteria never worked for
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
Edibles which I understand are not
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
allowed in in New Hampshire if that's
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
correct um but it's also not working
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
very well for inhaled products um this
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
around these are products
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh here go can pass this
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
thanks um these are products I picked up
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
last night in two Dairy smoke shops um
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
and these are highly intoxicating hemp
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
products that are mostly about
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
89% um intoxicating THC they include
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
three to four U some of them have ones
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
Delta eight some of them have as many as
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
three artificial cannabinoids like I
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
call them Franks they're they're a
 
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
product of the farm bill um and the
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
loopholes in the farm bill that have led
 
00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
companies to take excess CBD chemically
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
modify it into uh versions new isomers
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
of THC which I believe you tried to
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
address a few months ago in law um
 
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
there's about 20 25 of them now one of
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
them thcp is about more than 30 times as
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
potent as traditional Delta 9
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
THC um there's absolutely no data on
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
safety on these uh so I would recommend
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
um first you that you make some
 
00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
improvements and strengthen your law by
 
00:55:34.029 --> 00:55:34.039 align:start position:0%
clearly uh prohibiting the whole list of
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
these artificial cannabinoids both for
 
00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
the hemp sector and the Cannabis sector
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
because these substances are starting to
 
00:55:43.029 --> 00:55:43.039 align:start position:0%
make their way into cannabis sales as
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
well and that in addition to the 0.3
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
criteria that's in your current law that
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
you impose a simple per package limit of
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
no more than 1 milligram of any of these
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
intoxicating canab oid uh that may be
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
easier to enforce right now you'd
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
practically have to be a chemist to go
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
enforce in some of these places I mean I
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
know how to read these but took I'd
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
never heard of half this stuff not too
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
long ago and some of it didn't exist
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
five years ago um so you need simple
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
clear enforceable rules and you need
 
00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:16.039 align:start position:0%
actual investment and enforcement if you
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
don't constrain what's going on on the
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
hemp side you will completely undermine
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
a more robust uh state-led cannabis
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
system because this is cannabis it's
 
00:56:29.029 --> 00:56:29.039 align:start position:0%
highly intoxicating cannabis it has the
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
same negative health effects and if you
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
can go into any smoke shop and buy it it
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't help to create a well-controlled
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh cannabis system uh packaging
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
packaging really matters as you can see
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
from the pictures in your packeting in
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
your package um that's a lot of what
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
makes products attract kids um and that
 
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed by clearly uh
 
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
managing packaging you can reduce reduce
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of the burden of uh verifying
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
whether a product is attractive to kids
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
Maryland used to approve each package
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
but that's a lot of work we strongly
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
recommend um that you define
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
attractiveness to children in law and
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
detail and I can provide some draft
 
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
language I saw there was some already in
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
there I detail it further um but I would
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
also require plain packaging which four
 
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
US states have already done and Canada
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
has done and which is the international
 
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
standard for tobacco so make the
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
packages simple one color no pictures of
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
cartoons or animals or you know apples
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
and oranges and cherries and so forth um
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
because those things um create the
 
00:57:35.549 --> 00:57:35.559 align:start position:0%
illusion that the product is healthier
 
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
than it is and there's very good
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
evidence to substantiate that so we
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
recommend plain packaging as used in
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
Connecticut New Jersey Missouri and
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
someplace else um Health warnings um
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
current health warnings in Most states
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
are extremely weak they're in Sixpoint
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
font they're so small that nobody can
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
read them um I in there's one slide in
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
your uh packet uh that gives some
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
examples of how hard they are to see uh
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
we recommend based on um extensive
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
research both from tobacco and cannabis
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
following the model that the FDA is
 
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
adopting for cigarettes which is front
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
of pack prominent pictorial rotating
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
Health warnings so you take a single
 
00:58:18.109 --> 00:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
Health statement at a time you put it on
 
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
the package and you rotate across
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
warnings um because people can focus on
 
00:58:25.029 --> 00:58:25.039 align:start position:0%
a single statement about pregnancy or
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
about U mental health or other things
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
but not on 10 different ones very well
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
um and that be prominently placed and
 
00:58:36.029 --> 00:58:36.039 align:start position:0%
ideally accompanied by a picture um this
 
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
is very important because what we're
 
00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:39.640 align:start position:0%
seeing is
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
uh basically declining perception of
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
harm from Cannabis in the population
 
00:58:46.349 --> 00:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
even as the products have actually
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
gotten U more harmful less harmful from
 
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
a contaminant standpoint but more
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
harmful from an intentional uh design
 
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
and potency standpoint
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
um and we really need to correct and
 
00:58:59.789 --> 00:58:59.799 align:start position:0%
educate the public using front of pack
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
warnings delivers uh education on what
 
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
the risks are directly to the people who
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
are consuming and at no cost to
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
government um so it's very valuable
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
advertising uh we believe that
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
advertising should be restricted to the
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
extent possible under law so that
 
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
children are not exposed that Billboards
 
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
not be allowed Um this can actually is
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
something else that can work much better
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
under an exclusive um government
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
controlled system
 
00:59:27.029 --> 00:59:27.039 align:start position:0%
um we don't think you know they should
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
be selling cookies sweatshirts cookies
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
is a major brand of of cannabis um for
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
kids to be using at school loow control
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
preserved um that may mean that things
 
00:59:40.829 --> 00:59:40.839 align:start position:0%
go a little bit slower that your
 
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
legalization process is not uniform
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's something that's been happening
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
in California and legalization has been
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
gradually increasing every year across
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
the state uh 63% of Californians now
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
live in legal cities or counties
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
probably closer to 80 or 90% of them
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
live nearby where they can cross a small
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
border and have access um taxes whether
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
the state adopts a public or nonprofit
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh system taxes or margins captured in
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
other ways should probably be 20 to 40%
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
and ideally tiered to THC content 15% I
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
believe is too low to fund everything
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
you want to fund and lower than many
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
other states Washington for example is
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
37% if it is a state run process this
 
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
could alternatively be captured through
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh setting prices and recapturing
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
margins there's a couple ways to do it
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
um contrary to what industry says low
 
01:00:39.309 --> 01:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
taxes have not solved the illicit Market
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh not allowing overproduction of the
 
01:00:44.029 --> 01:00:44.039 align:start position:0%
proc of the product may be more
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
successful at constraining a lcit market
 
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
too much weed looking for a warm body to
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
consume it is the unhappy formula that
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
is driving massive elicit markets from
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
California to Oklahoma don't copy us um
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
unlimited cultivation is creating a glut
 
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
of product which has led to Falling
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
prices failing businesses persist in
 
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
illicit sales and aggressive Marketing
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
in many states so we recommend that
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
cultivation licenses and production
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
amounts be limited uh to try and
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
basically Target uh what you think
 
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to sell through the
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
system that's created um or and
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
certainly not exceed current Exum
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
consumption um if for-profit retailers
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
are allowed which I don't recommend I
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
would recommend that most initial
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
licenses be reserved for Equity
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
applicants not just a couple extra
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
points in the formula um and they will
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
need time uh to get started and to be
 
01:01:41.069 --> 01:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
successful if they're competing against
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
Rich investors from the start uh
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
typically they fail so in California
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
only about 10% of current storefronts
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
are owned by Equity
 
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
licenses um so uh finishing up as we
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
speak the cannabis industry labists are
 
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
likely inundating the halls of this
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
General Court this is happening across
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
the country federally in every state
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
making campaign donations just as the
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
tobacco industry did um I encourage
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
political leaders such as yourself to go
 
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
talk to school principls teachers nurses
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists rehab centers and parents
 
01:02:17.309 --> 01:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
and ask what they are seeing go visit
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
your neighborhood vape store and see
 
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:21.640 align:start position:0%
what's for sale the situation is not
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
good I believe you can build something
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
wise and solid for the Long Haul um or
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
you can copy systems that are proving
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
pretty disastrous um we are still
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
learning but please learn from our
 
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
mistakes be cautious be deliberate take
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
the profit out of it if you choose to
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
legalize commercial activity flip the
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
script and base everything on creating
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
legal access through a system that does
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
not drive up consumption and that can
 
01:02:50.829 --> 01:02:50.839 align:start position:0%
protect our children um I appreciate the
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here with you today
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
and to share what we've learned so far
 
01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:56.839 align:start position:0%
um I thank the governor's office and the
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
members of this committee and I'm happy
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
to serve as a resource as a resource as
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
you navigate these challenging choices
 
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.549 align:start position:0%
you navigate these challenging choices
thank

01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:03.559 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
you thanks doctor could you get a copy

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
Chief and how thank you very much I I
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
have more of a comment than a question I
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
just really want to thank you for being
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
here today and bringing before us a
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
cohesive wellth thought out plan in
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
order for our state to move forward
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
should we decide to move forward with
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
this a lot of what you brought before us
 
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh goes along with what we as the state
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
want to do and it's great to hear that
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
those are the things that we should be
 
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
doing so I just wanted to thank you
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
sir Chief thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
you for your uh extraordinary testimony
 
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
today uh is very uh incisive and um
 
01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
uh it points a a way and a pathway um
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
toward um a process that that could be
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh done um to mitigate as you say the
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
harmful effects if I could ask you this
 
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
question and it may be difficult for you
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
to answer uh but amongst all the
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
testimony that you provided today there
 
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
seems to be a number of areas or
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
elements where states have gone wrong um
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
pitfalls if you will things that other
 
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
states did uh that um you
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
recommend uh in your testimony and there
 
01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
are many points but what are the most
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
important elements in in your view to
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
avoid um um creating a problem that will
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
be uh impossible to be able to put back
 
01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:21.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
control uh thank you Mr
 
01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:28.839 align:start position:0%
sir uh there are several I think the
 
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
inexurable trend that we've seen towards
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
increasing potency in the marketplace
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
with starts in agriculture and the
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
agricultural techniques that are
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
currently being used up into
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing processes is probably the
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
biggest mistake because we've basically
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
allowed the product to get much more
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
harmful um
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
and um I think we have to serious ly
 
01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
start looking at how do we reverse that
 
01:05:58.510 --> 01:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
if we're going to sell flour how do we
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
have that flower be less potent not more
 
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
I saw you already had a provision to
 
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
assure that lower potency products are
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
at least offered in the draft which is
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
very important um where did set the
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
limits is really hard question so we
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
interviewed you know 100 people all
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
across the country experts from a wide
 
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
range of area including industry
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
consensus that potency is a problem
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
problem and one of the biggest public
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
health challenges when you ask what to
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
do about it people are all over the
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
place um with different solutions um and
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
yet that's leading to analysis paralysis
 
01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:40.839 align:start position:0%
um and I would say the biggest mistake
 
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
is not to do anything about it which is
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
what happened in California and I think
 
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
has been a very severe mistake um so I
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
would say set limits start
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
conservatively um you can always go up
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
you won't be able to go down very easily
 
01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
um so product regulation um not
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
incorporating lessons from Tobacco
 
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
Control um in a number of areas we know
 
01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
whether it's packaging or Price setting
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:12.630 align:start position:0%
um and so
on

01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.190 align:start position:0%
on
um

01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
over it's a complicated issue but
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
allowing agricultural overproduction
 
01:07:22.109 --> 01:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
which has led to a glot in many states
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
um I think you probably read the
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
newspaper article on
 
01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma uh for example um you know and
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
that just creates huge pressure from
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
failing businesses and people who've
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
invested and don't have anywhere to sell
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
their their production um that's a big
 
01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
mess we're seeing it in New York right
 
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
now we're you know we've just seen it
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
repeated in multiple States I I don't
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
know in New Hampshire how much of an
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
illicit production Market you have
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
already or not um but avoiding creating
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
huge new over production um this a big
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
big mistake is is one mistake I say look
 
01:08:00.269 --> 01:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
very carefully at how you avoid that um
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
creating too many retail
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
outlets and having those retail outlets
 
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
be right next door to the University of
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
California Berkeley for example where I
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
live um where there's like 10 stores on
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
the street right next to the university
 
01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
half of whose students are under
 
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
21 um but the more just having too many
 
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
stores so you want to have enough stores
 
01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
that you can supply people legally like
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
your ABC Stores is that what they're
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
called here
 
01:08:27.789 --> 01:08:27.799 align:start position:0%
the outlets um this the the state
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
Outlets um but not so many that you're
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
that they're aggressively competing to
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
to try and survive economically um
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
because the more storage there are the
 
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
harder it is um for them to capture
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
Market um I think you know those are and
 
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
and then not enforcing uh against
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
intoxicating hemp which is essentially
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis being sold outside of a
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
regulated cannabis system
 
01:08:57.789 --> 01:08:57.799 align:start position:0%
one followup question Mr follow up yes
 
01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
um in your testimony you you recommended
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
that there be a um and I apologize if I
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
use the wrong terminology but um a
 
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis Control Commission um and it
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
appears that you're familiar with uh the
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
proposed franchisee system here with the
 
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission of New Hampshire uh
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
being in in charge would would that mean
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
that there would be an oversight Control
 
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
Commission um that would oversee and
 
01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
approve what the Liquor Commission
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
promotes and reg for for regulation for
 
01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
example I would uh recommend an
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
oversight commission with
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
um Physicians substance abuse experts um
 
01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody from uh people from law
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement perhaps from Agriculture and
 
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.309 align:start position:0%
enforcement perhaps from Agriculture and
economics

01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
economics
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
um couple of Educators um but not
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
um but not um people with a direct
 
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
financial interest in the industry and
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
that they should review and approve um
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
the decisions the regulatory uh
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
framework what we're seeing in Most
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
states is advisory bodies that are
 
01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
loaded down with people from
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
industry um and the decisions that are
 
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
taken reflect that um and again I don't
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
want to underestimate the expert and the
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge that people in the industry
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
have I've learned a lot from them and
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
and um it is essential to guiding the
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
process so you have to be able to hear
 
01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
people from industry and get their input
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
um but they should not be taking the
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
final decisions but I do believe it also
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
should uh that that oversight commission
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
should have some power um to make sure
 
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
that those Public Health um interests
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the kids come first and not 10th uh
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
and that maximizing um even r to
 
01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
government I think this can be a
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
substantial source of Revenue to
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
government but that maximizing that
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be driving the decision making
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
regulations um we shouldn't be selling
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
products that are going to adct 30%
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
instead of 20% of users because it'll
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
bring in more money we don't want that
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
situation thank you so much thank you Mr
 
01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
chair not that anyone does that
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
consciously I'm sorry representative
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
kale thank you Mr chair first I want to
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
Echo the sentiments of chairman mikica
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony was
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
it was phenomenal testimony and thank
 
01:11:25.149 --> 01:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
you for coming out to the Grand estate
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
and uh talking to us so you you handed
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
out some products that you um picked up
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
at some stores in Dairy and I wrote down
 
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
a couple of notes I'm not really an
 
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
expert on on this stuff um it it looked
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
like there was some Delta 9 THC and some
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
Delta 8 in in in the packages so could
 
01:11:43.149 --> 01:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
you explain what the difference with
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
those are um and and maybe talk a little
 
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
bit are these those uh Frankenstein oids
 
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
that you were talking
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
about sure um first of all it's a
 
01:11:55.149 --> 01:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
pleasure to come to New Hampshire
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
there's much couldn't couldn't ask for a
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
more beautiful place to come
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
um the um so if you take traditional
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
cannabis the main and the two big
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids that are in there are CBD
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
canab canab oil which is not
 
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
intoxicating and Delta 9 THC which is
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
the psychoactive intoxicating element
 
01:12:20.189 --> 01:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
that's naturally present there's more
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
than a hundred different cannabinoids in
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
there but those are the two big
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
um as a result of the farm bill which
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
said specifically in 2018 that something
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
was hemp if it had less than 0.3% of
 
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
Delta 9 THC uh in the
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
plant um chemist got very creative and
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
they started taking the CBD which is
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
dominant in hemp so hemp has more CBD
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
and less um less uh Delta 9
 
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
THC modifying it chemically uh because
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
it is related chemically to to Delta 9
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
to the psychoactive uh product um into a
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
host of there's about 2025 of them and I
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
can provide a list because we have a
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
model law on this um that get you high
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
um some of them like thcp are about 30
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
times as potent as Delta 9 so it's
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
extremely hazardous substance one of the
 
01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
products I passed around has thcp in it
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
um as well as two others um there's
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
Delta 8 is uh one that's actually exists
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
in nature in very small amounts but the
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
industry is taking CBD and synthesizing
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
it the industry actually also takes CBD
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
and synthesize Delta 9 so some of them
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
may be labeled as Delta 9 that could
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
come naturally for the plant or
 
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's actually a product of of
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
synthesis and then there's Delta 10 hhc
 
01:13:49.629 --> 01:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
Z hhco thco they're different uh
 
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
chemical reactions uh to produce these
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
intoxicating um new forms of products
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
but they're basically all farm bill
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
workarounds we are trying to get the
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
farm bill corrected but I don't know
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with that this
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
year uh many of us presented testimony
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
to Congress on this issue um but
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
presuming it doesn't get solved I would
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
recommend that New Hampshire solve it um
 
01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
these substances have basically no
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
safety data you know so to sell a drug
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
you know through the FDA you have to go
 
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
through all kinds of Trials and prove
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
that it's not doesn't cause cancer that
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't do other things to your
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
health none of this stuff has been done
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
for these new um cannabinoids Regular
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis it hasn't all been done either
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
but we've been using it for so long we
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
kind of know what most of the health
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
effects are we're still learning some
 
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
but there's much more information um so
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
there's just simply no reason to allow
 
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
adding these new chemical soups out
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
there um and that's what Delta 8 and
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
Delta 10 and all these other ones are
 
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
those products though are very uh
 
01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
psychoactive products the ones I passed
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
around they're all about 90% um
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
psychoactive uh iceers of THC um so
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
they're the idea that the hemp industry
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
is selling
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
CBD uh they are selling CBD too but a
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
lot of what they're making their money
 
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
off of is highly psychoactive
 
01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
intoxicating hemp products and those
 
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
just shouldn't be allowed thank you so
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
much thank you um just for the members
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
we did pass a bill last year uh list
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
summer uh Senate
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 180 if you want to look at the hemp
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
limitations we did put into law um and
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure this one violates it um
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
right here this this would to be a
 
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor right now yeah the ones I
 
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
passed around I think are all illegal in
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire well so I'm not sure of
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
the other ones because it's it's unclear
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
on limitations but this one this one
 
01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
specifically says it's got a total of
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
33.2 n% of cannabinoids um and
 
01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
limitation is
 
01:15:59.229 --> 01:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
0.03% um based on that s sp180 so this
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
one is as far as I know Chief you
 
01:16:02.669 --> 01:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
probably should take possession of it
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
before we leave here today um but um
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
this one is illegal as far as I can tell
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
so as again synthesize THC
 
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
thco which is a a canabo acetate
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
limitation that is beyond what I can
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
read in the bill or at least my
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
assumption what's in the bill or or my
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
reading of the bill that that is so I do
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
think that we do have an issue I was
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
some of you follow me on Facebook I was
 
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
at the Pumpkin Fest this weekend um up
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
in lonia and this sign that said 420
 
01:16:35.629 --> 01:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
Edibles and legal
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
THC was sitting in front of one of the
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
vendor booths for everybody to kids
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
walking by and everything else going by
 
01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
and so I I will um share that because I
 
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
posted this someone from Canabis
 
01:16:51.629 --> 01:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
industry contacted the the person who
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
was doing this because the name of the
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
company companies on it and they agreed
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
to withdraw their sign in all future
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
vendor applications so there is some
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
compliance that they're willing to do
 
01:17:01.629 --> 01:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
but there's also the fact that there's
 
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
no regulatory requirement this is
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
completely legal because of the Delta 8
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
Delta 9 3% right um limitation so um
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's just an interesting the hemp Market
 
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
is an interesting little place that that
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
the CBD market for regulatory uh
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
concerns but um I did just want to
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
clarify one thing we're talking about
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
possession limits and limits for things
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
in in in the bill um I think you were
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
referencing the 20 milligrams and the
 
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
2000 um milligram THC content I think
 
01:17:35.629 --> 01:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that wasn't in a single
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
product it was the concept of if you're
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
going to a store and buying it's like
 
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
buying a six-pack of beer versus just
 
01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
buying one beer and going home and
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
drinking it and going back to buy
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
another one I think the idea was to
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
allow for transportation of the product
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
once you go to a store and buy and be
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
able to get it home without having you
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
know um a small quantity for for
 
01:17:57.149 --> 01:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
possession so it's just understand that
 
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure that's what the intent
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
of the bill was in here that where we
 
01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
talk about possession limits was how do
 
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
we deal with somebody who's not just
 
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
going to buy one you know enough to do
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
it right now but to take it home and and
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
and survive a week or or use it for a
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
week or two before having to go back to
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
the store again so yeah Ju Just to be
 
01:18:17.229 --> 01:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
clear the announce is quite a bit limits
 
01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
but possession limits yeah an ounce is
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
quite a bit so Most states have gone
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
with an ounce um and and um couple some
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
some some have gone with more um but uh
 
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
4 oz the amount that was in there was
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
quite on the high side and um the 20
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
milligrams was referring to serving
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
believe to standard serving dose um and
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
that was what I was saying was was way
 
01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
um way excessive um at least twice
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
what's typically used more like four
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
times what's recommended oh we got it I
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
think the concept was more of buying I'm
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
going to the store I'm going to buy what
 
01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
I might use in a week and not
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily what I'm going to carry on
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
my possession on a on a single edible or
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
a single that it was it was about to be
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
able to transport from the store back
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
home you know for and not get caught
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
with a a what would be classified as a
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
possession with intent to sell amount um
 
01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
above above uh the legal limit so but
 
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
also as you astutely pointed out some of
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
this is is an Enforcement issue so some
 
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
of it's making the law maybe easier to
 
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
apply but some of it's is investing
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
mark thank you Mr chair um Dr Silva your
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony is one of the most
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
powerful arguments against legalization
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
that I have ever heard um we did hear
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
although I respect your opinion your
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
your position of taking no no position
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
on this um we did hear uh last week uh
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
from um two medical experts uh from from
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
Boston uh a child a child psychiatrist
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh from Boston Children's and a
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
neuroscientist and um what they did is
 
01:20:02.629 --> 01:20:02.639 align:start position:0%
they provided the commission a statement
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
of concern of of marijuana policy in
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and it was signed by
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
43 um pediatricians mental health and
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
addiction clinicians and scientists uh
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts and um they spoke um
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
very clearly about some of the situ
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
situations this seeing with their
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
patients and they're not good uh they've
 
01:20:26.239 --> 01:20:27.669 align:start position:0%
patients and they're not good uh they've
seen

01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
um the um increased risk of serious
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
mental illness that that you spoke to
 
01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.830 align:start position:0%
mental illness that that you spoke to
psychosis

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
psychosis
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia and not only the the youth
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
population but the young adult
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
population and um they they're very
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about this and so they they
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to take a collective stance uh in
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
the state um I am really concerned about
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
these impacts as well uh potential
 
01:20:59.550 --> 01:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
impacts that that most likely we we will
 
01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
see in New Hampshire if many of the
 
01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
safeguards that you haven't haven't
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
you've uh spoken to today which unlikely
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
to be uh to be honest to be integrated
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
in in our system um but I appreciate
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
your expertise on that uh my question
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
for you is um there is this widespread
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
um lack of public Awareness on
 
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
particularly not only the addiction
 
01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
risks but the the mental health risks do
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
you have any advice on how we can raise
 
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
perception of risk uh amongst
 
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
particularly the parent uh population in
 
01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:43.629 align:start position:0%
particularly the parent uh population in
New

01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I think there are a number
 
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
of practical ways to raise perception of
 
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
risk I you know I used to be assistant
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
Health commissioner in New York we spent
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of money um doing education
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
campaigns um you know we've got grants
 
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
from federal government we use City
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
money to um educate people about um
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
tobacco about sugar sweeten beverages
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
about exercise um but it's
 
01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
expensive um so I do recommend and and
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
when we started our first round of
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
interviews in 2017 I called the folks in
 
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
Oregon and I said what would you have
 
01:22:19.629 --> 01:22:19.639 align:start position:0%
done differently he said the first thing
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
I would have done was I would have had
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
some money upfront before the stuff hit
 
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:25.639 align:start position:0%
the hit the streets doing public
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
education about harms um and it has to
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
be well done like creative stuff not
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
boring um you got to like get a good Ad
 
01:22:35.709 --> 01:22:35.719 align:start position:0%
Agency figure out how to get people to
 
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
actually pay attention to it um so I do
 
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
think that's important that you put some
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
resources towards a good quality
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
creative public education on um on the
 
01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
mental health issues on pregnancy use
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
it's very important um but I would ALS
 
01:22:52.639 --> 01:22:53.950 align:start position:0%
it's very important um but I would ALS
also

01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
um say that strong Health warnings on
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
both hemp and cannabis products um like
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
ones that people will actually read and
 
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
see are something that won't cost you
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
any money um that you know will be used
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
day in and day out and hit your target
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
audience of consumers so I would say
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
that's a really important place to
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
invest front of pack prominent victorial
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
Health warnings on products and and on
 
01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.110 align:start position:0%
Health warnings on products and and on
any

01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
advertising uh that is allowed um there
 
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
are states that require warnings on
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
Advertising I forget which ones um so
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's not without precedent um and yeah
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
this is really hard um I was always an
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
advocate for legalization in the past I
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
was terrified I've been terrified by
 
01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
what I've seen um in California and the
 
01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
direction that it's taken um so I'm much
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
more cautious now um
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
and at the same time these products are
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
out there you know people are getting
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
them um they are being exposed so the
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
the benefit from legalization is if you
 
01:23:59.950 --> 01:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
can really do this better than what the
 
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
illicit Market is is pushing on people
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
right now um which I would like to think
 
01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
is possible we actually really really
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
need a state to provide a good model for
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
the nation of how this problem can be
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
addressed that's why I was so happy to
 
01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
come here today um because we
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
desperately need that the models that
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
are being created are not good you know
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
so let New Hampshire be the place that
 
01:24:25.629 --> 01:24:25.639 align:start position:0%
does it right um and creat something
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
that's safer um if possible if you if
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
you choose to legalize um that would
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
that would be my my request we need a
 
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
better way to do this thank you could I
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
follow up Dave second let me go to Dave
 
01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:39.149 align:start position:0%
follow up Dave second let me go to Dave
over

01:24:39.149 --> 01:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
there could you tell us uh based on your
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
experience and looking at different
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
states in well Quebec in particular
 
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
typically where do the funds that the
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
state the revenues that the state uh
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
raised through the sale where do they go
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
to could you just start with Quebec
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
first um Quebec it goes to a fund um a
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
public fund a fair amount of which is
 
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
going to eliminate the illicit market
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
and to enforcement and then I believe
 
01:25:10.109 --> 01:25:10.119 align:start position:0%
also to substance abuse I'd have to
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
double check on that um I sent I think I
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
sent the data to your office from the
 
01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
their annual call
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
with with the doctor U not with Fran G
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
yeah Professor G from The Institute and
 
01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
in Montreal um the um in other states
 
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
it's really very varied uh California
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
actually that's one of the things it
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
didn't do badly um so the tax revenue
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
which was $817 Million last year in a
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
state of 40 million people of course um
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
went um a smaller pot goes to community
 
01:25:46.109 --> 01:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
reinvestment and economic development uh
 
01:25:48.669 --> 01:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
the largest PO is the youth prevention
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
education and treatment fund um which um
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
75% of which is going to child care
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
slots about uh a quarter of it is going
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
to a youth um prevention programs which
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
both include like mentoring natural
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
resources opportunities for Youth and
 
01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
Substance Abuse Prevention uh activities
 
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
um some of it goes to the Department of
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections for diversion programs and
 
01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
other uh youth programs that are
 
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
operated through um Corrections in law
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement um and then off the top is
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
everything um that goes to the
 
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
Regulatory and enfor system so that
 
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
comes off first and then the remaining
 
01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
and then there's 10 million a year for
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
research um so the remaining allocations
 
01:26:33.149 --> 01:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
come after the basic regulatory uh
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
expenses are
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
addressed but it does vary from state to
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
state and with with some states has
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
there been an issue I know you addressed
 
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
it a little bit has there been an issue
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
where they become somewhat dependent on
 
01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
the revenue in and for different things
 
01:26:50.109 --> 01:26:50.119 align:start position:0%
and then when the there's been a revenue
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
drop across the country put put in
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
different states you know where I've
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
seen that is in tobacco taxes so I'm you
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
know tobacco taxes are very important
 
01:27:01.109 --> 01:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
they've been extremely effective at
 
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
constraining use of tobacco and reducing
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
youth use um but they're falling because
 
01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
it's working you know so we're doing a
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
great job consumption is declining um
 
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
but that means there's less tax revenue
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
so for example in California our uh
 
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
first five system which supports
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
children's programs is uh funded by the
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax um that taxes declining and
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
the system is squeezed um so that is a
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
problem when you fund good things um
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
with tax revenues on a product whose
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
consumption you're trying to bring down
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
when you succeed which you hope you do
 
01:27:37.149 --> 01:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
um whatever your funding can be put in
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy so if you fund a you know
 
01:27:43.109 --> 01:27:43.119 align:start position:0%
retirement system or um something um
 
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
that's not that has no flexibility um
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
although I think children's stuff
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have flexibility either
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
um you you will eventually if you're
 
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
successful at constraining consumption
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
you will either have to raise the tax
 
01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
which is a good option so like figure 20
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
years from now the illicit markets gone
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
you're mostly in a legal Market
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
situation it's a product whose
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
consumption you want to drive down it
 
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
might be okay to raise the tax uh to
 
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
further reduce consumption um and keep
 
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
revenue stable um right now when you're
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
still in this elicit elicit Market
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
situation um you know figuring out where
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
to put taxes is is is comp licated um
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
and just one more question and can you
 
01:28:30.189 --> 01:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
uh just speak to the over production um
 
01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:31.719 align:start position:0%
you know you talked about how that needs
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
to be prevented but how does that
 
01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:35.719 align:start position:0%
contribute and how has it contributed to
 
01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
the illicit Market uh in California
 
01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
particular oh it's a disaster um so
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
California even when we legalized at the
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
time we legalized we were producing
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
about I think it was 13 million pounds
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
of uh cannabis and about 2 million were
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
estimated to be consumed in state so
 
01:28:55.629 --> 01:28:55.639 align:start position:0%
California was an engine of illegal
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
exportation you know even before
 
01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.030 align:start position:0%
exportation you know even before
legalization

01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
um with legalization um the state it was
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
originally only supposed to license
 
01:29:09.070 --> 01:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
small cultivators but they didn't
 
01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
respect what was in the ballot
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
initiative and issued more licenses to
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
large cultivators so we ended up with
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
both huge illegal
 
01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
cultivation um and legal cultivators who
 
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
were producing more than what the legal
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
system could absorb and therefore
 
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
started to look for Outlets uh for what
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
they were producing legally um outside
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
of the legal system um so that has led
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
to Falling prices on the legal Market um
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
cultivators who invest in in creating
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure failing um you know it's
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
it's been a very very messy and that's
 
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
happened in many states uh across the
 
01:29:49.149 --> 01:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
country um that either issued excessive
 
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
numbers of legal licenses California was
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
particularly complicated because we
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
already had such huge infrastructure but
 
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
the elicit Market's actually grown in
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
California um in recent years uh because
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement has declined and many Das
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
are reluctant to
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
pursue um illegal sales um or the guy
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
gets you know fine there's one story I
 
01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
got told the guy got an $800,000 fine
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
showed up the next day with a suitcase
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
with $800,000 in cash and delivered it
 
01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know so so even high fines are
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
are sometimes not effective so it's um
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's a major you know we've seen human
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
trafficking violence uh a lot of um
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
problems associated with um excess
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
production on both sides uh particularly
 
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:39.400 align:start position:0%
elicit but also even on the legal Market
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
um so i' just say if you don't have that
 
01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
huge illegal production going on here
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
now and I actually don't know um what
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
your situation is um just be uh um you
 
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
want to try and help transition your
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
producers to Legal production but you
 
01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
want to be careful um the public
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
Monopoly or public lead approach could
 
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
be applied to the whole thing to
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
cultivation manufacturing and retailing
 
01:31:11.109 --> 01:31:11.119 align:start position:0%
Quebec just focused it on the retailing
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
sector um I think that's the most
 
01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
important that you you know sort of
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
choke point that you want to control um
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
you can have um how you handle
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
cultivation and Manufacturing is another
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
issue I'd say that's that might be less
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
essential to be one last thing could you
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
just tell us about the website your
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
website our website yes what you have on
 
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
it it's uh called getting it right from
 
01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.550 align:start position:0%
it it's uh called getting it right from
the

01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
start.org um and I think it's on the
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
materials one of the pages I handed out
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
to you at the bottom um and thank you
 
01:31:47.109 --> 01:31:47.119 align:start position:0%
doctor I appreciate that just to let you
 
01:31:49.229 --> 01:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
know our tobacco tax is down
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
10% State of New Hampshire I know this
 
01:31:58.109 --> 01:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
is the Live Free or Die state so um yes
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Silver I I love the uh
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
title getting it right from the start if
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
we don't implement the safeguards the GU
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
rails that you have um so eloquently put
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.910 --> 01:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
wrong yeah I think it's better to
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
decriminalize and live with ambiguity
 
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
like Portugal does than to um create a
 
01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:28.790 align:start position:0%
like Portugal does than to um create a
huge

01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
huge
 
01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
for-profit set of interests that are
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
legal I think that that's the most
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
um so I try and get it right thank you
 
01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to let let you know all
 
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
three um subjecta experts from the
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
medical field agree with you that that
 
01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
we heard from last last week they don't
 
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
believe we can get it right because when
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
you put more of an harmful addictive
 
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
substance on the ground it it it creates
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
more problems more addiction more mental
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
health issues and um suicides so thank
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you Doctor anything else so
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna ask where El said thank you
 
01:33:13.149 --> 01:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
Doctor very much for your testimony
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
again if you can get any your written
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
testimony over to daily I very much
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I'll send that and thank
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
you so much for the opportunity and this
 
01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
was a long time to speak with St legisl
 
01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
it's unusual and I appreciate it hey
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
Mike I'm going to ask you to come up for
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
one for a couple minutes yes please I
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
want to ask you about the medical um
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
have you talk about the medical industry
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the lab testing that's done there to
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
kind of give us a standard of where the
 
01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
therapeutic industry is in testing a
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
like uh thank you Senator L So to that
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
that point could you just talk a little
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
bit about under the under the
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic model what are you doing for
 
01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
testing who does the testing is there
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
reference checks done as well um yeah
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm Michael Hol
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
administrator for the therapeutic
 
01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis program with the Department of
 
01:34:09.629 --> 01:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
um the therapeutic cannabis law has a
 
01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
grant of rul making Authority that
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
allows the department to um write rules
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
for testing standards uh it also
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
requires that uh the testing Laboratory
 
01:34:23.229 --> 01:34:23.239 align:start position:0%
the test for therapeutic cannabis be
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
licensed um by our health facility
 
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
Administration under RSA
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
151 um there is one independent Testing
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
Lab in the state of New Hampshire uh
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
they're Nelson analytical they're
 
01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
located in Manchester and they're
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
licensed by the uh another uh or uh a uh
 
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
organizational unit within the
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
department so basically our rules
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
require that every batch of can cannabis
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
Harvest batch of cannabis be tested for
 
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
both contaminants and cannabinoid
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
profile the contaminants range from
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
mold uh micro microb uh microbials
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
um heavy metals uh Etc it's a standard
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
panel um the this the threshold levels
 
01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
have not been updated since the rules
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
were written back in 2014 I will you
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
know I'll I'll fully admit that that is
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
a body of work that we are that we are
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
working on to update those levels um but
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
every batch of cannabis is tested um
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
every concentrate batch is tested um and
 
01:35:31.709 --> 01:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
over the course of the program we have
 
01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
required a um uh the atcs to conduct a
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
robust quality assurance program um
 
01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
requiring individual products to be
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
tested as well um the uh the lab is uh
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
Nelson analytical was a was an
 
01:35:48.430 --> 01:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
environmental lab testing uh food water
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
Etc um they volunteered to enter this
 
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:51.990 align:start position:0%
Etc um they volunteered to enter this
business

01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
um there is no limit on the number of
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
Laboratories um that are allowed to test
 
01:35:57.390 --> 01:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
for cannabis in the state of New
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but no other Testing
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
Laboratories have come to the for to uh
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
Engage The atc's in uh in in in testing
 
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
and and get a license
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
um so the only last question I have is
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
because you covered everything I think
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
is reference testing right so who's
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
testing the tester right that is not a
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
that is not a requirement so we're
 
01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
currently not doing it because it's not
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
in rules and it's not in law correct
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
they are they are ISO accredited I I
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
don't have the number um offand like uh
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
previous test uh people testifying have
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
but they they're ISO accredited in um
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
they have DEA number so they can you
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
know get the the Cannabis uh you know
 
01:36:42.669 --> 01:36:42.679 align:start position:0%
samples from uh sources to regulate
 
01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
their systems
 
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
um it is not uncommon that uh B of
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis fail um testing you heard
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
testimony from the atcs that number is
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
about 10% um I I can't confirm uh that
 
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:01.159 align:start position:0%
number um offhand um however you know
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
batches of cannabis do uh uh exceed the
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
thresholds uh we rece the state receives
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
all of the testing reports proactively
 
01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
um and and we manage that uh th those
 
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
those exceedances we do allow
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
exceedances of uh certain uh
 
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
contaminants to be remediated uh through
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
extraction um which uh is the basically
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
flour gets turned into concentrates we
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
test the concentrates again for those
 
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
same contaminants and and they pass
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
contaminate thresholds um so it's it is
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
true that not every you know batch that
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
exceeds a threshold uh needs to be
 
01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
destroyed it can be remediated uh and
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a costs saver for the uh
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
the atcs um it's important that the the
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
draft that we're dealing with now has an
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
allowance for um remediation protocols
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
um for uh for failed badges one last
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
question before I give it to the chief
 
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
for a question costing who pays for the
 
01:37:58.589 --> 01:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
costing for the testing iscs
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
payb 100% of the cost for each of the
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
tests that are required St there are no
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
cost of the states at all for this
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
program well I understand that I'm just
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
talking about the lab testing purposes
 
01:38:11.229 --> 01:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
for this conversation around how much is
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
it cost for a lab that costing right now
 
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
is currently covered for testing the
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
$450 fee we heard was a guesstimate
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
batch test cost that's covered by the
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
ATC with the testing that's correct give
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
me one second
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
Chief thank you Mr chair uh if I Mr
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
chair could request that you request
 
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS to provide a comprehensive list of
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
the testing protocol uh listing the
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
contaminants pesticides and other uh
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
elements that they test currently uh
 
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
with this contractor to provide that to
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
the committee or commission sir okay
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
I'll give out another homework
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
assignment just give me a minute Tim
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair sh so um who who pays
 
01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
for your office space and your
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
electricity that you use to do your work
 
01:38:59.709 --> 01:38:59.719 align:start position:0%
the the patients of the program and the
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
atcs so we we have a cost allocation
 
01:39:04.270 --> 01:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
program where we the tax AR paying any
 
01:39:06.189 --> 01:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
of that correct we pay we pay uh we have
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
a cost allocation procedure um where uh
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
programs pay rent uh essentially um pay
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
for our heat pay for our office space
 
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
pay for our chairs uh and whatnot
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a common um approach to
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
for those kinds of things uh for
 
01:39:27.070 --> 01:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
programs uh like well all programs um we
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
we share the cost of our legal
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
department we share the costs of our you
 
01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
know finance department uh Etc so again
 
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
I I think what he's saying is it's
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
similar to the liquor model it's similar
 
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
to the lottery model in that those
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
agencies from the revenues they receive
 
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
take out their expenses first before
 
01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
delivering any Revenue to the
 
01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
state is that is that correct is that a
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
summation that's by basic
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
understanding I I know that I'm paying
 
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
rent and heat and air conditioning for
 
01:40:00.669 --> 01:40:00.679 align:start position:0%
my space in 29 Haz and
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
drive all right so I have so you have a
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
homework assignment right two of them I
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
would I would I would offer one thing uh
 
01:40:12.189 --> 01:40:12.199 align:start position:0%
and that is we do not release to the
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
public meaning the atc's which pesticide
 
01:40:18.669 --> 01:40:18.679 align:start position:0%
chemicals we test for um we keep that
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
confidential um so that um they don't so
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
that if we have a discret list MH of
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
pesticides that they know that we can
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
test for that means that if they use a
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
different pesticide that is not on that
 
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
on that list then they would know that
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's that it can't that that we don't
 
01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
test for it and uh they might be able to
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
use it um and it not be uh discovered so
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
I would just I would offer that as a as
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
a note of caution that you know our
 
01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
pesticide list that we test for um that
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
we that we work with our uh the The
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
Testing Lab is is not made public to the
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
atcs we might have a sidebar
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
conversation on that under under J car
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
I'm the vice chair J car and I'm going
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
to remind you your if 2014 is when you
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
put your rules in they're due to expire
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
next year you better get them get them
 
01:41:10.830 --> 01:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
renewed if you hav't we've updated those
 
01:41:12.589 --> 01:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
rules a number of times
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
since um so again so whatever rules you
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
have for lab testing um if we could get
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
those those rules out to the committee
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
that would be great so we could see them
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
and then any generic um that doesn't
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't cause any any release of
 
01:41:31.629 --> 01:41:31.639 align:start position:0%
sensitive data for the number of batches
 
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
and percentage of batch of failures you
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
have in a testing cycle would be in a
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
given year how many tests were done how
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
many had failure rates would be useful
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
Chief yes thank you Mr chair I think
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of comment that uh
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
the state uh has a vested interest in
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
knowing uh in in interest of full
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
transparency exactly what uh the testing
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
protocol currently is for these uh
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
atcs and I think that uh the members of
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
this commission are are well versed in
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality nature of of any
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
such um material but I think that the
 
01:42:13.709 --> 01:42:13.719 align:start position:0%
public interest outweighs uh any
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
confidentiality interest here in
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
ensuring that um the uh regulatory
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
process is complet compl comprehensive
 
01:42:24.589 --> 01:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
and is protecting the public currently
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh as well as being able to compare that
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
to what may be recommended by the
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
commission moving
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
forward I don't necessarily disagree as
 
01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:35.639 align:start position:0%
I I I have a little concern that we keep
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
a list private from the from the atcs
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
and what we're testing for how how do
 
01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
they know how to meet the standard if
 
01:42:42.510 --> 01:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
they don't know what they're being
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
tested against the atcs know the only
 
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
thing the atcs don't know is that the
 
01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
list of pesticide chemicals that the lab
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
can and currently test for and that list
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
has increased over time as they've
 
01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
developed more protocols for various
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
chemicals now I
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
mean if if I'm asked to provide that
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
list to this this body then yes I'll
 
01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
provide the list to the body I'll
 
01:43:07.229 --> 01:43:07.239 align:start position:0%
certainly confer with my director um but
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
I just wanted you to know that we do not
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
release that list to the atc's so that
 
01:43:16.589 --> 01:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
they can use chemicals that are not on
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
that list that are still prohibited yeah
 
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy
 
01:43:25.229 --> 01:43:25.239 align:start position:0%
the committee Mr sh again yeah we have
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
the Canadian list and they're very clear
 
01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
on what they test for so um again I
 
01:43:31.709 --> 01:43:31.719 align:start position:0%
guess the question was how does our list
 
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
compar to their list compared to what
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
I've asked the other homework assignment
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
to do is provide me a list of what are
 
01:43:38.109 --> 01:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
the contaminants and the trigger
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
thresholds that that would create a
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
failed batch if you will corre happy to
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
provide that list to the commission up
 
01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
to the commission to determine whether
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
or not they want to make that list
 
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
public great okay anything else for Mike
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
S I just want to know how your lab
 
01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
testing was done whether we had a state
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
lab or independent lab I would be
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
welcome to engage um the the the owner
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
of the lab if you wanted to hear more
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
detailed information about ISO
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
accreditation and anybody else have any
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
business what is the rationale for
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
keeping this um non-public and doesn't
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
know I believe I already answered that
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
question and that is if the atc's were
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
to have the list of chemicals that the
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
lab can test for that means that they
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
know what the lab is not testing for
 
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
which means that the atcs could use
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
pesticides that are not being tested for
 
01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
and we would never know so that's the
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
rationale all right thank you
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
Mike um so I go I missed uh approval of
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
the minutes so I have a motion to
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
approve the minutes of September
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
24th Mr Mr chair there is just the
 
01:45:02.589 --> 01:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
excellent minutes but there was uh on
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
bullet number seven it's it's incomplete
 
01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
it says adolescents who experience
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis induced psychosis and do not
 
01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
stop are likely to conver convert to and
 
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
let me get a motion then we can have a
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
conversation right so I need a motion to
 
01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
approve then we can amend and adjust as
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
we need but I need a motion to approve
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
the minutes first first and then we'll
 
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
have a discussion about the minutes and
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
if we been moved by Senator Whitley
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
second by representative kahill to adopt
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
the minutes as written uh for October
 
01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
24th 2023 and Now comments on the
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
minutes yes um there's a need to amend
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
the minutes on page two under Dr Amy
 
01:45:43.149 --> 01:45:43.159 align:start position:0%
turn Cliff's Neuroscience uh testimony
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
if you go to Bullet number seven it it
 
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
reads adolescence who experience
 
01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis induced psychosis do not stop
 
01:45:53.229 --> 01:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
are likely to convert to and it's blank
 
01:45:55.709 --> 01:45:55.719 align:start position:0%
it's an incomplete sentence uh it should
 
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.390 --> 01:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia if if the minutes could be
 
01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
amended to read I'd appreciate it thank
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
you any other changes to the
 
01:46:09.310 --> 01:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
minutes than so all those in favor of
 
01:46:11.229 --> 01:46:11.239 align:start position:0%
adopting the minutes as amended signify
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
by saying I I oppose nay abstain and one
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
abstention minutes are adopted all right
 
01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.669 align:start position:0%
abstention minutes are adopted all right
so

01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:24.109 --> 01:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
let's quickly talk about future meetings
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
for a minute about if do do we have a
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
need to bring anybody else in and then
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to start going through the
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
bill my goal would be to go to 12:30 um
 
01:46:33.790 --> 01:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
so 45 minutes to just continue through
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
the bill um after we figure out whether
 
01:46:37.709 --> 01:46:37.719 align:start position:0%
or not we want any other speakers is any
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
other information we think we need at
 
01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
this point or will the next meeting just
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
be continuing through the
 
01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:45.950 align:start position:0%
be continuing through the
bill

01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
yep um Mr chair I think at our original
 
01:46:51.790 --> 01:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
meeting one of the uh departments we
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear from was the New
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Treasury Department I i'
 
01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
like to I'm sorry which one New
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire treasury treasury the treasury
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
is I think we need to know how we're
 
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
going to handle illegal
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
money thank
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
you I'll put a request out to see if
 
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
they'll come in and speak to our
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee I I can't guarantee they will
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
but I will make the request thank you Mr
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
chair um I I believe uh Mr Mara had
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
spoken in our first meeting
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh having someone from Quebec if
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
we could find the person from the Quebec
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
folks to come in and in light of uh Miss
 
01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
Silver's Miss Silver's uh testimony
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
today with respect to her opinion of the
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
Quebec model um particularly one that is
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
being the most effective profitable in
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
Canada perhaps it may be worthwhile to
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
have a representative one would be
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
willing to come to New Hampshire from
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
Quebec to talk about how their model is
 
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:47:55.589 --> 01:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
works I would have I'll have I'll give
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
it to that's a homework assignment I'm
 
01:47:59.550 --> 01:47:59.560 align:start position:0%
gonna give to Chairman abis um and he
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
can take care of see if he can find
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
somebody who's willing to come in and
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
speak and again any member who knows
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
somebody who might be willing to come in
 
01:48:07.629 --> 01:48:07.639 align:start position:0%
and speak on that from Quebec on their
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
model then just get the name and and
 
01:48:12.669 --> 01:48:12.679 align:start position:0%
again we can bring them in next month or
 
01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:15.679 align:start position:0%
next meeting May I defer to Dave Mara I
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
I think Dave had been in contact with
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
so if you want Dave if you want to make
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
a request if he wants to come in and
 
01:48:31.629 --> 01:48:31.639 align:start position:0%
speak and because Quebec did a state
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
model if I remember right um and they
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
can talk about their state model and
 
01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
pros and cons what worked and what
 
01:48:38.709 --> 01:48:38.719 align:start position:0%
didn't and if they're willing to come in
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
so now Daryl doesn't get the assignment
 
01:48:40.719 --> 01:48:44.910 align:start position:0%
so now Daryl doesn't get the assignment
you

01:48:44.910 --> 01:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.310 --> 01:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
do all right so that's our we have two
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
speakers we'll reach out to the New
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Treasury and we'll have and
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
Dave will see if he can find somebody
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
from Quebec to speak about the Quebec
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
State model they did there um with that
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a five minute recess
 
01:48:59.070 --> 01:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
we going to go use the restroom come
 
01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
back and we're going to go jump right
 
01:49:02.589 --> 01:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
into the bill and start off where we uh
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:49.109 align:start position:0%
 
week

01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.119 --> 01:50:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.040 --> 01:51:18.950 align:start position:0%
 
that's

01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
light

01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.960 --> 01:54:18.629 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
so if there's anybody from public that
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
wants to chat about anything they heard
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
or or um recommendations before we start
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
in we'll continue
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
on if not not seeing anybody we're gonna
 
01:54:33.189 --> 01:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
again jump right back in so I think
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
we're on page five of uh the draft Bill
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
we left off with possession limit and a
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
discussion around that I'm not sure I
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
was going to leave that alone for today
 
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
because I do think that's a bigger
 
01:54:47.950 --> 01:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
conversation as we see further on what
 
01:54:50.189 --> 01:54:50.199 align:start position:0%
that looks like in the bill so I'd
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
recommend we just skip over possession
 
01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:53.679 align:start position:0%
limit and go down to start with public
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
place number
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
22 is there any comments on the
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
definition of public
 
01:55:03.629 --> 01:55:03.639 align:start position:0%
place go ahead Tim I mean this do does
 
01:55:07.069 --> 01:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
this include the roads like ways so it
 
01:55:09.790 --> 01:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
would so again uh Chief over there could
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
probably tell you public a public way
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
public place what what a better
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
definition is as it relates to our
 
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes but yes a public place
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
is generally anywhere accessible so it
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
be sidewalks roads
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
um even restaurants that's if it's a
 
01:55:24.069 --> 01:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
public place that the Public's allowed
 
01:55:26.069 --> 01:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
Ingress it doesn't include private and
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
closed places
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
so that that would be generally correct
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh private um Property Owners would uh
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
like a residential property owner would
 
01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
have um the right to exercise um on
 
01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
their on their property for example in
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
your backyard for example but uh in a
 
01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
public place is essentially any place
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
that the public has a right to be
 
01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:52.830 align:start position:0%
that the public has a right to be
without

01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
permission um so that's essentially
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
sidewalks public ways uh public uh uh
 
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
public buildings government buildings
 
01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
Town buildings uh essentially anything
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
that is not private space
 
01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
right good so how does that relate with
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
like say your personal vehicle on a
 
01:56:17.629 --> 01:56:17.639 align:start position:0%
public space and I'm asking
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
because um
 
01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
we've had an abnormal amount of traffic
 
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
fatalities recently and the highest
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
number of motorcycle crashes
 
01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
um killing killing motorcycle riders
 
01:56:32.589 --> 01:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
this year and I met with a group of
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
motorcycle riders last night um and I I
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to know a large group of
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
motorcycle riders and I wanted to know
 
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
what their thoughts on on that were and
 
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
and they came up with an interesting
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
statement they were talking about hands
 
01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
handsfree and and and it's my
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
observation that these vaporizers things
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
and cars are not handsfree and um you
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
know I just I just want to kind of
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
understand you know we're going to be
 
01:56:58.709 --> 01:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
talking about penalties and and things
 
01:57:01.229 --> 01:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
like that and and and limitations and
 
01:57:02.589 --> 01:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
and I definitely don't want to see
 
01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
people smoking in their car if it's
 
01:57:07.390 --> 01:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
technically a a private thing and we
 
01:57:09.629 --> 01:57:09.639 align:start position:0%
really need to be strong I think I think
 
01:57:11.709 --> 01:57:11.719 align:start position:0%
jumping you jumped ahead on page seven
 
01:57:13.229 --> 01:57:13.239 align:start position:0%
there's a specific prohibition on
 
01:57:15.629 --> 01:57:15.639 align:start position:0%
smoking in a car so that would be
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
different than so we what we'll get to
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
about the prohibition piece but um so
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
even so a public way again no one while
 
01:57:25.629 --> 01:57:25.639 align:start position:0%
no one has access to your car inside of
 
01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
your vehicle right we have a specific
 
01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
exemption saying even inside your
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle though you can't smoke it's a we
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
recognize it's a private place but you
 
01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
still can't smoke inside your vehicle so
 
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that when we get there
 
01:57:40.589 --> 01:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
so this is outside of that
 
01:57:45.790 --> 01:57:45.800 align:start position:0%
provision so 22 is okay 23 premises
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
means that includes all parts of a
 
01:57:49.390 --> 01:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
contiguous real estate occupied by a li
 
01:57:51.390 --> 01:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
liy over which the ly has direct and
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
indirect control or interest and which
 
01:57:57.629 --> 01:57:57.639 align:start position:0%
the ly uses in the operation of a
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
licensed business which has been
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
approved by the commission as a proper
 
01:58:05.229 --> 01:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
place in which to exercise the lenes
 
01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
privilege any it's the building right
 
01:58:12.069 --> 01:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
it's the building uh any any question
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
about that or any
 
01:58:17.069 --> 01:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
changes good
 
01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
there number 24 resident means a natural
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
person who a is domiciled in New
 
01:58:27.709 --> 01:58:27.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and B maintains a place of ab
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
boode in New Hampshire unless the
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
individual was homeless and residing in
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at least 51% of the time
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
so any def any concern about Resident
 
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
Chief yes yes Mr chair I I would propose
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
that we redact on uh subsection B uh the
 
01:58:45.069 --> 01:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
words unless the individual is homeless
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
and residing in New Hampshire for at
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
least 51% of the time um this this
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
particular legislation uh needs to be uh
 
01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
spec specific with respect to who a
 
01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
resident is um and maintaining a place
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
of abod in New Hampshire consistent with
 
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
how we treat residents for tax purposes
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
as well as registration motor vehicle
 
01:59:07.149 --> 01:59:07.159 align:start position:0%
operation would be consistent I think
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
more with where we need to be than uh
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
referencing homeless
 
01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
folks or are transient and oftentimes
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
have no
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
identification yeah yeah I I agree I
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
don't think we I I think it's a slippery
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
slope to be modifying the definition of
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
Resident um because you know this can be
 
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
referenced and used later down the line
 
01:59:30.030 --> 01:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
on like say a resident for voting and I
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to go down that slippery
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
slope so I guess the issue is I got to
 
01:59:37.149 --> 01:59:37.159 align:start position:0%
see how the word resident used later on
 
01:59:39.149 --> 01:59:39.159 align:start position:0%
in the bill which is I think some of the
 
01:59:43.950 --> 01:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
problem right so um so I'm okay with
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
again if if the committee is okay with
 
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
removing that that's fine but just
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
understand we may have to revisit it if
 
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
we go back and look at a given statute
 
01:59:54.069 --> 01:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
that says something about Resident
 
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
because then technically we'd be
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
excluding every homeless person from
 
02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
possibly this law right if if it says a
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
resident shall not and we've we've now
 
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
to set a a homeless person is not
 
02:00:08.189 --> 02:00:08.199 align:start position:0%
classified as a resident um that could
 
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
be a problematic for us yeah well Mr
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
chair I think in going forward uh in the
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
bill there there are references as you
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
indicated um with respect to how to
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
prove residency
 
02:00:24.069 --> 02:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
right um and a homeless person uh based
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
on again going um ahead which were not
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
there yet and and I I believe that you
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
know there there would
 
02:00:36.109 --> 02:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
be it would be impossible to to
 
02:00:38.109 --> 02:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
establish residency if the intent here
 
02:00:40.910 --> 02:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
is to uh to find a resident someone who
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
lives in New Hampshire by way of
 
02:00:45.149 --> 02:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
documentation that's presented further
 
02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
in the bill and I think that perhaps at
 
02:00:50.750 --> 02:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
least put an asteris here or redact it
 
02:00:53.069 --> 02:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
for the time being based on what the
 
02:00:55.750 --> 02:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
requirements to produce residency are
 
02:00:59.470 --> 02:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
included in uh further on so so daily
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you a homework
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
assignment um can you take a look at it
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
maybe call out everywhere in the bill
 
02:01:06.350 --> 02:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
where the word resident is use so we can
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that this homeless piece
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't cause any kind of conflict and I
 
02:01:15.390 --> 02:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
you know we we don't want to create I
 
02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
don't think that we want to as a
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
legislature want to create a new
 
02:01:21.709 --> 02:01:21.719 align:start position:0%
definition of who is a resident there's
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
ample reference to the definition of
 
02:01:26.669 --> 02:01:26.679 align:start position:0%
resident in state law so I I don't know
 
02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
I don't I wouldn't suggest that we
 
02:01:30.910 --> 02:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
create a new definition so let's just
 
02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
take a look where it's used in the in
 
02:01:34.589 --> 02:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
further see if we need to leave it
 
02:01:36.350 --> 02:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
whether we just strike the entire
 
02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
definition of Resident because it'll be
 
02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
used whatever the standard definition is
 
02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
for everything else in state law or
 
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
whether we modify this one so if we just
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
take a look daily let's take a look at
 
02:01:47.709 --> 02:01:47.719 align:start position:0%
that great so we're going to skip over
 
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
number 24 until we get get a little
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
further answer I'm sorry had a question
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
I think the was just jumping in saying
 
02:01:55.950 --> 02:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure we don't exclude
 
02:01:58.589 --> 02:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
homeless people yeah just I I believe
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
I've seen this in other sections of the
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
code so I think it we I'd be happy to
 
02:02:02.830 --> 02:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
take that on as a homework assignment to
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
go back and see where else in the code
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
it defines resident sure and come back
 
02:02:08.669 --> 02:02:08.679 align:start position:0%
with daily you take a look at the bill
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
and see where it is and if you would
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
take a look at other statutes where we
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
have resent required all right so we're
 
02:02:16.030 --> 02:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
02:02:18.030 --> 02:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
definitions yeah well I'm gonna we're
 
02:02:22.109 --> 02:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
not quite out um I in your handout just
 
02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
to um there's a couple definitions we
 
02:02:26.830 --> 02:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
gave to the doctor that was here last
 
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
week um she was unable to attend because
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Medical Society is
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
having their annual meeting this week um
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
Friday through Sunday and so she was
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
unable to attend but she did her
 
02:02:39.390 --> 02:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
homework assignment sent it back into us
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
um so if you want to take a look well
 
02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
she has you'll see some definitions of
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
draft Bill reviewed and distributed at
 
02:02:47.069 --> 02:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
the meeting and she's talking about line
 
02:02:50.669 --> 02:02:50.679 align:start position:0%
four on page four for line 26 was one of
 
02:02:56.709 --> 02:02:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:04.149 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:03:09.069 --> 02:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
y yeah so it's number number um eight in
 
02:03:11.470 --> 02:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
your um definition in your definition
 
02:03:14.430 --> 02:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
list so she re
 
02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
re-qualify um and says Count's product
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
means any product containing
 
02:03:21.629 --> 02:03:21.639 align:start position:0%
parts of a plant genus cannabis
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
containing over uh 3% THC on dry weight
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
basis cannabis products shall not
 
02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
include seeds of the genus cannabis hemp
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
or hemp products as defined
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
by does that definition work for
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
everybody so uh Mr sherff a question um
 
02:03:42.830 --> 02:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
in light of U Miss Silver's uh testimony
 
02:03:44.910 --> 02:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
with respect to the various analoges I'm
 
02:03:46.510 --> 02:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
going to refer to that as these as
 
02:03:50.830 --> 02:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
analog of THC and can abono canabo THC P
 
02:03:54.549 --> 02:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
THC deltaed H
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
um if if we want to as a commission make
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations as to what a cannabis
 
02:04:03.030 --> 02:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
product is perhaps and to close the
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
loophole that apparently exists um in
 
02:04:11.069 --> 02:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
cabil mwe that's now being exploited by
 
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
retailers perhaps maybe we again put an
 
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
asterisk there and come back and look at
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to include some
 
02:04:19.870 --> 02:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
of these other
 
02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
um products um that are being sold
 
02:04:25.709 --> 02:04:25.719 align:start position:0%
currently that have intoxicating
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
elements to them so I I think if you
 
02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
look at the bottom of this page we're
 
02:04:31.870 --> 02:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
looking at there's a conversation about
 
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
nope the of the doctor's handout
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
definitions she has hemp and she talks
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
about those other things relative to
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
hemp right so I think this is
 
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about um cannabis
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
based not hemp based product
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:51.350 align:start position:0%
based not hemp based product
right

02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
what I think the chief is talking about
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
is not the hemp based products per se
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
but the analog to uh THC products the
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
Deltas right I've run in you've run not
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
you we have run into this issue and
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
trying to make a laundry list either by
 
02:05:09.870 --> 02:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
chemical composition or whatever you
 
02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
only have to change one or two uh
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
component elements and it's legal so the
 
02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
language needs to be broad enough to
 
02:05:21.629 --> 02:05:21.639 align:start position:0%
include mhm but not exclude
 
02:05:25.149 --> 02:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
CBD exactly and that's often times what
 
02:05:27.069 --> 02:05:27.079 align:start position:0%
we found with fentanyl and some of the
 
02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
other uh illicit drugs where chemists
 
02:05:34.109 --> 02:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
exploit uh the molecular structure to
 
02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
create a product that is essentially
 
02:05:38.830 --> 02:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
producing the same effect but is not
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
particularly defined so that's what I
 
02:05:44.109 --> 02:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
think we're referring to here is looking
 
02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
at um making sure that it's broad enough
 
02:05:49.950 --> 02:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
um from from a molecular and from a
 
02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:51.390 align:start position:0%
um from from a molecular and from a
legal

02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
legal
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
standpoint so what's interesting is in
 
02:05:56.669 --> 02:05:56.679 align:start position:0%
in the one in the Senate Bill 180 um
 
02:05:58.830 --> 02:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
there's a line just at the end or any
 
02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
other THC isomer
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
variant which would deal with any other
 
02:06:06.109 --> 02:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
version in case like right now we have
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
Delta 8 and Delta 9 God knows what else
 
02:06:09.549 --> 02:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
we might end up and there a Delta 10 as
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
well um maybe that line would would
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
would just Encompass you know if you
 
02:06:18.189 --> 02:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
have a THC or THC like you know where
 
02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
where I didn't see that where does that
 
02:06:21.629 --> 02:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
so that's in Senate Bill 180 when we
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
were talking about the hemp products and
 
02:06:25.870 --> 02:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
the and the and the dry weight of Delta
 
02:06:30.189 --> 02:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
9 Delta 8 THC in allowed allowed amounts
 
02:06:32.189 --> 02:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
and it just says that's that's that's a
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
separate bill that's not this bill right
 
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
but my question is whether we add that
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
line to be consistent or any other THC
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
isomer variant yes where it says you
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
know so again if you read uh it would
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
read cannabis products means any product
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
containing parts of the plant genus
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
cannabis containing over point I think
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be 03 not3 yeah
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
03 um
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
THC or any um of THC or any other THC
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
isomer variant and then continue on with
 
02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
the sentence on a dry weight basis right
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
so that would take care of um any
 
02:07:12.030 --> 02:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
deviation or variation I was I would ask
 
02:07:14.069 --> 02:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
the AG's office to just take a look at
 
02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
that language determine whether or not I
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
don't think we've had any cases on point
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
maybe they have are aware to make sure
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
that that is a language that uh can
 
02:07:27.470 --> 02:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's enforcable okay no the the
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
question I have on that is ISO
 
02:07:32.549 --> 02:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
variant uh is that I was ask the lb
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
people yeah is that that because I'm not
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
quite sure what I I assume it means a
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
derived fun a term of art or jargon
 
02:07:43.310 --> 02:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
correct yes well if it's a ter of art
 
02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
own all right so we'll consider adding
 
02:07:53.549 --> 02:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
that line but I'll get I'll ask C AG
 
02:07:54.990 --> 02:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's an enforceable
 
02:07:56.790 --> 02:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
comment right because I think we're what
 
02:07:58.589 --> 02:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
we what we've heard is that there is a
 
02:08:00.669 --> 02:08:00.679 align:start position:0%
plethora of synthetic cabon oids now
 
02:08:03.069 --> 02:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
that are that are now coming out uh that
 
02:08:06.549 --> 02:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to prove up under
 
02:08:06.559 --> 02:08:07.430 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to prove up under
that

02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:09.709 --> 02:08:09.719 align:start position:0%
definition and again just again we have
 
02:08:11.189 --> 02:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
to see where cannabis products are being
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
used further on but this is more an
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
Enforcement issue for the Liquor
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
Commission and in their rules and
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
regulations about their managing and
 
02:08:18.159 --> 02:08:19.350 align:start position:0%
regulations about their managing and
control

02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
ring so all right so we'll we'll look at
 
02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
that line we'll ask C AG for an opinion
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
on that and then we'll come back so
 
02:08:29.470 --> 02:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the doctor's next one which
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
is line 30 page8 and the definition
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
of number one I don't know where that is
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
yeah definition of marijuana but I'm
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
surprised it's all the way back in page
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
30 yeah um so but it's a definition so
 
02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
it's under the personal possession uh
 
02:08:48.589 --> 02:08:48.599 align:start position:0%
component and and it just says say
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
marijuana includes the leaves flowers of
 
02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
all species of the genus plant cannabis
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
containing over and I think that's
 
02:08:55.709 --> 02:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
02:08:59.229 --> 02:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
0.03% of THC and we may want to again
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
include that same or any THC isomer
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
variant um on the dryway basis and it
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
goes on and includes all the different
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
derivatives and and those kind of things
 
02:09:16.549 --> 02:09:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
yes right yeah yeah yeah yeah we
 
02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
adjusted it because in her definition
 
02:09:23.790 --> 02:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
she uses three and I think we're saying
 
02:09:27.549 --> 02:09:27.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
Z she has a correct corre her definition
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
is correct yes okay 0.3
 
02:09:36.510 --> 02:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
right just for statory construction do
 
02:09:39.069 --> 02:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
we want to put that definition in the
 
02:09:41.069 --> 02:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
move it to the definition
 
02:09:46.109 --> 02:09:46.119 align:start position:0%
section um Mr chair you've now got two
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
definition you got two words for the
 
02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
same product I was concerned about that
 
02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis product and marijuana in theory
 
02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
are the same exact thing but and the
 
02:09:56.990 --> 02:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
secondary definition marijuana is a
 
02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:03.390 align:start position:0%
secondary definition marijuana is a
derogatory

02:10:03.390 --> 02:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
term that was specifically created to
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
denigrate a particular group of
 
02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
individuals problem is this this is a
 
02:10:14.189 --> 02:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
um what so this part of the chapter is
 
02:10:16.510 --> 02:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
actually around well the criminal
 
02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
statutes exactly so products yeah I
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
think it's talking about I I I see the
 
02:10:22.990 --> 02:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
point but it is talking about two
 
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
different things because we're actually
 
02:10:26.589 --> 02:10:26.599 align:start position:0%
talking about the produ the products
 
02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
that are made from this plant I guess Mr
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I suggest that if you just say
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
that the um the term
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
marijuana is a
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
um quot ter qu that word for uh cannabis
 
02:10:45.709 --> 02:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
products therefore you're using cannabis
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
products all the definitions of cannabis
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
products are then adhering to the use of
 
02:10:51.870 --> 02:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
that other
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
word I I think the problem is when we're
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
talking I actually don't know this the
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
criminal statute it's what it's referred
 
02:11:03.629 --> 02:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
to right marij okay yeah so that that's
 
02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
so we so we don't need we'd have to
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
rewrite the entire right so we don't
 
02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
need 318 statute if we decide to
 
02:11:11.109 --> 02:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
reference cannabis Pro so we don't need
 
02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
we don't need maybe the the solution is
 
02:11:16.350 --> 02:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
we don't need a separate definition for
 
02:11:18.549 --> 02:11:18.559 align:start position:0%
marijuana in page 30 we have a defition
 
02:11:20.189 --> 02:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
for cannabis we have a definition for
 
02:11:22.629 --> 02:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis products and there's likely a
 
02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
definition in the in the criminal
 
02:11:27.229 --> 02:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
statute yeah my my only point is that if
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
we tie the two words together we're
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
taking the definitions and and tying
 
02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
them together at that point so you're
 
02:11:35.470 --> 02:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
not changing you don't have to change
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
all the others you just say use General
 
02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
language uh no other section of law
 
02:11:44.549 --> 02:11:44.559 align:start position:0%
withstanding uh the use of uh the
 
02:11:46.549 --> 02:11:46.559 align:start position:0%
phraseology marijuana or marijuana
 
02:11:51.709 --> 02:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.669 --> 02:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
products and there therefore you've
 
02:11:55.069 --> 02:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
covered everything we don't have to
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
rewrite everything we've got it in one
 
02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:59.390 align:start position:0%
rewrite everything we've got it in one
place

02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
done I got your your point yeah let's
 
02:12:04.589 --> 02:12:04.599 align:start position:0%
let's have that conversation I think
 
02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
when we get to that section okay let's
 
02:12:09.149 --> 02:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
move we'll just just pay attention to
 
02:12:11.149 --> 02:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
that we'll get when we get to that page
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
30 we'll we'll take it up but I think
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
that that's a probably a bad idea myself
 
02:12:17.549 --> 02:12:17.559 align:start position:0%
um because we'd have to rewrite the
 
02:12:19.149 --> 02:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
entire three 18 Satur and everywhere
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
marijuana is referenced I'm not sure
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
Cannabis um definition cannabis products
 
02:12:27.069 --> 02:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
definition meets the same definition as
 
02:12:27.079 --> 02:12:28.350 align:start position:0%
definition meets the same definition as
marijuana

02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
02:12:30.589 --> 02:12:30.599 align:start position:0%
so just just one thing that came to my
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
mind when we're talking about adding the
 
02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
section about cannabis products the the
 
02:12:39.549 --> 02:12:39.559 align:start position:0%
words to Encompass the the artificial
 
02:12:39.559 --> 02:12:41.430 align:start position:0%
words to Encompass the the artificial
cannabis

02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
synthetic we we're are we anticipating
 
02:12:47.229 --> 02:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
that my for my inum we're anticipating
 
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
that the product that's going to be sold
 
02:12:51.870 --> 02:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
at these stores are plant grown so by
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
adding that into the definition of
 
02:12:57.149 --> 02:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis prod products are we making it
 
02:12:59.069 --> 02:12:59.079 align:start position:0%
all right would we be making it legal
 
02:13:02.549 --> 02:13:02.559 align:start position:0%
for the franchisees to be selling
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:11.629 --> 02:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
point it it depends I think later on in
 
02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
the legislation as to what the
 
02:13:18.030 --> 02:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
legislation will Define as products that
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
can be sold right so I think in the
 
02:13:24.430 --> 02:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
broader sense uh perhaps this section
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
deals with the broad definition of what
 
02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
it is later on in the legislation there
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
would be language concerning what
 
02:13:36.589 --> 02:13:36.599 align:start position:0%
cannabis products are to be allowed to
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
be sold as opposed to what products
 
02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
could not be sold but if we I'm just
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
saying if we're saying cannabis products
 
02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
with defining it and then if somebody
 
02:13:48.109 --> 02:13:48.119 align:start position:0%
goes back to what the definitions of
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
what what can we
 
02:13:51.709 --> 02:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
sell well again so that's going to be
 
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
regulated by Lottery and Li by I keep
 
02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
saying Lottery sorry liquor
 
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
um but again I my my this this is merely
 
02:14:04.589 --> 02:14:04.599 align:start position:0%
containing products that saying that
 
02:14:06.589 --> 02:14:06.599 align:start position:0%
anything that contains THC greater than
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
the 3% right but uh to his point Mr
 
02:14:12.910 --> 02:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
chair maybe we could add um cannabis
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
product mean any product at the end of
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
that first sentence comma as further
 
02:14:21.629 --> 02:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
defined in regulation or as further
 
02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
defined by the electric commissioner
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
approved cannabis products uh would
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
would probably cover it right if you add
 
02:14:30.589 --> 02:14:30.599 align:start position:0%
the word approved or authorized cannabis
 
02:14:33.629 --> 02:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
product but by whom well I think that's
 
02:14:35.549 --> 02:14:35.559 align:start position:0%
going to be covered later on in some
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that decides who's
 
02:14:40.270 --> 02:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
going to write regory stuff that gives
 
02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh liquor the right to but if you're
 
02:14:44.189 --> 02:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
going to stay approved you want to be
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
more prescriptive about by home all
 
02:14:48.030 --> 02:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
right let's leave it as those two
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
sentences those two definitions as open
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
to see how they're used later on in the
 
02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
uh in the bill and then we can come back
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
and visit and I will have a conversation
 
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
with the AG and and see what they
 
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
say just just want to flag as well in
 
02:15:01.750 --> 02:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
our packets that we got today new
 
02:15:03.709 --> 02:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
Futures has a new handout for everyone
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's helpful just for reviewing going
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
forward from a public health standpoint
 
02:15:10.350 --> 02:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
um we're just running through
 
02:15:13.990 --> 02:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
definitions still we're just getting to
 
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
we got to the end I think and we're just
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking to the doctor's homework
 
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
um let's put aside the doctors because
 
02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
she references things that are later on
 
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
in the bill and we'll come back to the
 
02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
doctor's homework after we've gotten to
 
02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
that section to see how it how it works
 
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
in there so let's go on
 
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis so just we'll take item one um
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
in as in a whole section and entertain
 
02:15:55.510 --> 02:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
any comments about uh section one of 318
 
02:16:01.790 --> 02:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:05.549 --> 02:16:05.559 align:start position:0%
cannabis so here we have uh we talk we
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
set the age restrictions of you have to
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
be 21 or
 
02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:16.709 align:start position:0%
be 21 or
older

02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:16.719 --> 02:16:26.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
in section A we just talk about basic
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
possession consumption and using that
 
02:16:32.349 --> 02:16:32.359 align:start position:0%
isn't illegal on its own as a standard
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
unless we have some
 
02:16:37.669 --> 02:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
other Provisions down the road like in
 
02:16:40.709 --> 02:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
section A Mr chair I just offer up
 
02:16:43.469 --> 02:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps tightening up uh this would be
 
02:16:44.669 --> 02:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
on line
 
02:16:48.270 --> 02:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
15 where it says capacity as a and I
 
02:16:51.509 --> 02:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
would add new New Hampshire licensed
 
02:16:54.830 --> 02:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
staffer of a add New Hampshire cannabis
 
02:16:58.509 --> 02:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
product that restricts exactly who we're
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
talking about so it's a re New Hampshire
 
02:17:07.349 --> 02:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:07.359 --> 02:17:11.669 align:start position:0%
 
person

02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:14.270 --> 02:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
okay so on line 15 I think you're saying
 
02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
capacity as a staff or of a licensed
 
02:17:18.429 --> 02:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis product man manufacturer and
 
02:17:22.990 --> 02:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:25.509 --> 02:17:25.519 align:start position:0%
right da you get that
 
02:17:32.070 --> 02:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
one thank you B any comments on B yes go
 
02:17:36.349 --> 02:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
transferring if I make some brownies and
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
have a party am I transferring to an
 
02:17:46.589 --> 02:17:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:46.599 --> 02:17:51.790 align:start position:0%
 
me

02:17:51.790 --> 02:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
my argument is yes you would be
 
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
violating the law right no different
 
02:17:57.230 --> 02:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
than alcohol are you have a party and
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
you have friends over and you let a kid
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
go get a beer from the fridge or kid
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
goes against a beer fridge and you don't
 
02:18:02.830 --> 02:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
know about it you're still obligated
 
02:18:04.589 --> 02:18:04.599 align:start position:0%
under your license under your premises
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
so okay but that I think that should be
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
that that when you're saying
 
02:18:13.070 --> 02:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
transferring what we're what we're doing
 
02:18:15.629 --> 02:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
is defining transferring to include that
 
02:18:17.709 --> 02:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
language I think the chief has a comment
 
02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
Chief yeah uh Mr chair and uh thank you
 
02:18:24.349 --> 02:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh I would be opposed this language can
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
be construed as gifting right and this
 
02:18:31.110 --> 02:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
opens up a plethora of issues with
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
respect to gifting and transferring
 
02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:34.110 align:start position:0%
respect to gifting and transferring
without

02:18:34.110 --> 02:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
remuneration uh cannabis products so uh
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
I would be opposed to section b as it
 
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
stands uh simply because it enables
 
02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.509 align:start position:0%
stands uh simply because it enables
enables

02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
enables
 
02:18:49.709 --> 02:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
gifting SE
 
02:18:52.509 --> 02:18:52.519 align:start position:0%
not sorry correct this would this would
 
02:18:54.030 --> 02:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
legalize the
 
02:18:56.830 --> 02:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
transfer you know of of marijuana from
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
one person to another under 21 who met
 
02:19:01.230 --> 02:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
all the conditions and controls so you
 
02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
can't give it to I mean over 21 you
 
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
can't give it you can give it you could
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
transfer mar mar marijuana in my
 
02:19:07.509 --> 02:19:07.519 align:start position:0%
possession I could hand it to Daryl if
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
he wanted it and I could walk away as
 
02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
long as I didn't ask for
 
02:19:13.629 --> 02:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
renumeration and the question is whether
 
02:19:15.230 --> 02:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
we want to make that legal or
 
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
illegal I think the other question is
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
Maybe the Attorney General's off if you
 
02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
don't mind do we need to have the word
 
02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:30.110 --> 02:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
liability um for a excuse me for a
 
02:19:32.589 --> 02:19:32.599 align:start position:0%
criminal statute if it's not addressed
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
specifically in the statute then
 
02:19:35.790 --> 02:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
statutary construction would read in the
 
02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
knowing uh mental state so um you don't
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
have to include it if you want to to do
 
02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
anything other than a knowing default uh
 
02:19:48.349 --> 02:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
then you'd want to want to specify that
 
02:19:51.389 --> 02:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
but if it's left unsaid then it would
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
state well Chief Becky do you have
 
02:20:01.230 --> 02:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
something there no I was just Notting in
 
02:20:03.309 --> 02:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
agreement I just saw your light on it I
 
02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
was just thinking U was brought up
 
02:20:07.870 --> 02:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
transferring I think all of us remember
 
02:20:12.190 --> 02:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
in uh College smoking Ops uh other
 
02:20:14.429 --> 02:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
people's cigarettes
 
02:20:17.710 --> 02:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh something that routinely you never
 
02:20:20.190 --> 02:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
did no no okay no idea what you're
 
02:20:22.590 --> 02:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:20:25.349 --> 02:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
um so from the AG's office the question
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
of adding a a a mental state knowingly
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
is that necessary or not necessary the
 
02:20:32.750 --> 02:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
default assumption is that absent that
 
02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
the standard is
 
02:20:37.389 --> 02:20:37.399 align:start position:0%
knowingly yes that's correct thank
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
you Chief did you have something else no
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
I would just again I just uh when you
 
02:20:44.550 --> 02:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
open the door to gifting uh in the
 
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
language that's included in section B um
 
02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
it it flies in the face of what we've
 
02:20:52.030 --> 02:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
heard today from Miss silver and others
 
02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to encouraging the transfer
 
02:20:57.550 --> 02:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
I think the state wants to ensure that
 
02:20:59.230 --> 02:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
whatever products are being sold are
 
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
sold to people that are responsible and
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
possess so we'll leave that question
 
02:21:10.349 --> 02:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
mark we'll come back and address it
 
02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
because we have at least one objection
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
to that section so we can come back and
 
02:21:15.630 --> 02:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
see if we want to address it and take a
 
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
boat um so the trans from Cannabis
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
includes cannabis products to a cannabis
 
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
testing facility that won't be illegal
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
if you're transporting for that purpose
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
and giving are we talking about transfer
 
02:21:29.230 --> 02:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
or trans and see we do we actually mean
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
transporting well I think the
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
transporting is later on we have a
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
definition and some stuff in language
 
02:21:35.429 --> 02:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
relative to that this is just
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that while you might have
 
02:21:37.950 --> 02:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
a licensed transport you're going to
 
02:21:39.910 --> 02:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
give the product to somebody else in
 
02:21:41.790 --> 02:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
this case a testing facility we want to
 
02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's not somehow
 
02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
construed as being illegal okay I think
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
transferring luji implies that the
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
person from point A to point B is a
 
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
change in ownership
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
right um D um controlling property where
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
the acts described under the section
 
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
occur not sure what are you trying to
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
get to
 
02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
there I have no idea what that means I
 
02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
have no
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:15.550 --> 02:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
means well it's a reference I think if
 
02:22:17.309 --> 02:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
you're in control the the the house
 
02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
where it happens but I'm not sure why
 
02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:20.469 align:start position:0%
where it happens but I'm not sure why
that

02:22:20.469 --> 02:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:22.510 --> 02:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
would so I guess if you're allowing if
 
02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
you own a house or a property and you
 
02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
allow miners on you know you let your
 
02:22:29.630 --> 02:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
kids have a party and let all the
 
02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
underage kids start smoking there but
 
02:22:35.070 --> 02:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
we're listing here those acts that are
 
02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:39.110 align:start position:0%
we're listing here those acts that are
not

02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
illegal yeah I'm just not sure why I'm
 
02:22:43.950 --> 02:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
not sure what that statute what that
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
section does or why it's
 
02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:48.070 align:start position:0%
section does or why it's
there

02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
anybody hold on
 
02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
out maybe this is relative to
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
cultivators thank you Mr chairman for
 
02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
the record Matt Simon Granite Leaf
 
02:23:04.910 --> 02:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis I happen to be familiar with
 
02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
the Advent of the section which was
 
02:23:08.910 --> 02:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
written I believe specifically to
 
02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
prevent the kinds of gifting that we've
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
seen in the District of Columbia and in
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
other states that do not yet have
 
02:23:19.630 --> 02:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
regulated markets uh so first of all I
 
02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
think you have to legalize transferring
 
02:23:23.469 --> 02:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
because otherwise it could be cons it
 
02:23:24.790 --> 02:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
could be a criminal offense to pass
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
somebody a joint or to hand somebody a
 
02:23:28.910 --> 02:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
small amount of cannabis so I think
 
02:23:30.190 --> 02:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees that shouldn't be a
 
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
criminal offense generally what we were
 
02:23:35.429 --> 02:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
seeing in DC in other states with uh no
 
02:23:37.990 --> 02:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
regulated market was okay I can't sell
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
you cannabis but I'll sell you a t-shirt
 
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
for $100 and the T-shirt comes with a
 
02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
half ounce of cannabis so this was very
 
02:23:48.150 --> 02:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
openly happening companies were
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
advertising that this was what they were
 
02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
doing and this language is intended to
 
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
make it very clear that that's not legal
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
that a transfer without remuneration is
 
02:24:04.190 --> 02:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
legal and a transfer for remuneration is
 
02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
not does that make sense right but we
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
were talking under Section d That's
 
02:24:11.150 --> 02:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
controlling property where the acts
 
02:24:13.070 --> 02:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
described under this section
 
02:24:15.070 --> 02:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
occur so okay I'm sorry I thought you
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
were still talking about B and C and
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
there were some question about gifting
 
02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
and and what what this was about so I
 
02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
think we're clear there I think D we're
 
02:24:23.309 --> 02:24:23.319 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what is controlling
 
02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
property where the acts described under
 
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
the section occur don't know what that
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
does if I may offer perhaps this means
 
02:24:35.950 --> 02:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
that um if you're permitting legal use
 
02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
that you must be p a person that
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
controls that property to permit the
 
02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:42.710 align:start position:0%
controls that property to permit the
legal

02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
legal
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
use in other words
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh someone could not be um allowed to
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
use um and prohibited from use without a
 
02:24:56.510 --> 02:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
person that's actually controlling that
 
02:24:58.110 --> 02:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
property in other words someone else who
 
02:24:59.429 --> 02:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't live there says oh yeah you can
 
02:25:02.190 --> 02:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
smoke on the property um and then you
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
but that person doesn't own the
 
02:25:08.110 --> 02:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
property but this specifies the legality
 
02:25:11.429 --> 02:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
that reflects the owner of the property
 
02:25:14.190 --> 02:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
making the decision as to whether or not
 
02:25:16.429 --> 02:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
the legal it's it's legal use that goes
 
02:25:16.439 --> 02:25:17.910 align:start position:0%
the legal it's it's legal use that goes
to

02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
if a private property owner wants to
 
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
permit uh use as it is permitted under
 
02:25:26.830 --> 02:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
law on in that in that private property
 
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
they can do so so let's is that but that
 
02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
language is it needed because my thought
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
is let's say we're talking about like a
 
02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
beer I don't want someone drinking beer
 
02:25:39.150 --> 02:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
at my house I I my next step is if I ask
 
02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
them to leave if they don't leave
 
02:25:40.319 --> 02:25:41.309 align:start position:0%
them to leave if they don't leave
they're

02:25:41.309 --> 02:25:41.319 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
trespass but you're controlling the
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
property what this says is that you must
 
02:25:46.510 --> 02:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
be the controller of the property in
 
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
other words you must have a legal right
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
to control the property as opposed to
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
someone who's in your house says oh no I
 
02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
don't want you to have beer in Mr abb's
 
02:25:57.309 --> 02:25:57.319 align:start position:0%
House okay so I think you guys are
 
02:25:59.630 --> 02:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
saying the same thing and I think that
 
02:26:01.150 --> 02:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
this is not necessary because it's sort
 
02:26:03.269 --> 02:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
of covered an existing law is not
 
02:26:04.950 --> 02:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
necessary so let's do this this came out
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
of house bill 639 which representative
 
02:26:09.469 --> 02:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
hunt was in control of so why don't we
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
wait till he's here we'll take I think d
 
02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
and e because E I think is another one
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
assisting a person who's under 21 years
 
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
or older in any of the acts described
 
02:26:19.710 --> 02:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
under the section but the section is
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
talking about legal legal consumption so
 
02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know why and that would be
 
02:26:27.870 --> 02:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
conspiracy let's just let's hold for
 
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative the HT to see why he put
 
02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
this in 639 he may have a very
 
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason I don't quite get I
 
02:26:35.389 --> 02:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
was thinking the controlling property
 
02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
piece might be about manufacturers
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
having a a building full of marijuana
 
02:26:42.429 --> 02:26:42.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis products and making sure that's
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
not illegal that they have a building
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
full of marijuana so um even if they
 
02:26:47.790 --> 02:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
aren't con assuming in their possession
 
02:26:49.389 --> 02:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
and you control the building so
 
02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
therefore I I'm not sure so let's just
 
02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
talk to John and see where he was going
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
with that provide they're not needed
 
02:26:56.510 --> 02:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
they they should be stricted they cover
 
02:26:56.520 --> 02:26:57.630 align:start position:0%
they they should be stricted they cover
them

02:26:57.630 --> 02:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
right all right so uh so d&amp; we're going
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
to hold and for representative hunt and
 
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
I'll ask a homework question for
 
02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:10.750 align:start position:0%
I'll ask a homework question for
him

02:27:10.750 --> 02:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
yes sure step up and hit the microphone
 
02:27:15.429 --> 02:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
and continue
 
02:27:17.790 --> 02:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
on and just introduce yourself so we get
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
up the sure Pat suvin uh retired chief
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
of GS toown worked on the drug task
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
force for two years and currently the
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
executive director for the Chiefs
 
02:27:30.190 --> 02:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
Association 318b colon
 
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
26 addresses control of premise and
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
makes it illegal for a person to control
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
a premise or a vehicle where there's
 
02:27:40.030 --> 02:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana kept used or
 
02:27:43.550 --> 02:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
stored what this is doing is eliminating
 
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
that so what it's doing is taking that
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
out of 12 uh colon 26 and making it
 
02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
legal to use a vehicle in this case a
 
02:27:58.670 --> 02:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle for or home for storage so I
 
02:28:00.590 --> 02:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
believe that's where this is addressing
 
02:28:03.550 --> 02:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
it should perhaps we should just repeal
 
02:28:06.590 --> 02:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
that section I wrote it down we'll come
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
back as thank you Chief thank you
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
Chief all right so we're on to section
 
02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
two no law enforcement employed by an
 
02:28:17.309 --> 02:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
agency that receives state or local
 
02:28:20.070 --> 02:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
government fund shall expand any state
 
02:28:21.870 --> 02:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
or local expand any state or local
 
02:28:23.830 --> 02:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
resource including officer's time to
 
02:28:25.750 --> 02:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
affect an arrest or C of cannabis or
 
02:28:27.309 --> 02:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
conduct any investigation on the sole
 
02:28:28.990 --> 02:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
basis of the activity officer believes a
 
02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
constitute violation of federal law and
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
it goes on that's Sanctuary policy
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's a sanctuary policy I have to be
 
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
honestly I oppose this myself I would
 
02:28:41.389 --> 02:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
like to strike this language um uh
 
02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
because again we have um the assistance
 
02:28:48.349 --> 02:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
of Federal Officer who have safety
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
concerns and safety issues and they may
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
be ex affecting a raid of some sort for
 
02:28:55.950 --> 02:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
an elal grow under federal law that
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
we're not doing under state law for
 
02:29:00.269 --> 02:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
whatever reason and I would not want to
 
02:29:01.830 --> 02:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
limit local police departments and state
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
police departments from providing Aid
 
02:29:06.349 --> 02:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
which has information and resources that
 
02:29:06.359 --> 02:29:07.349 align:start position:0%
which has information and resources that
could

02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:29:11.590 --> 02:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
be could be uh help reduce risk to
 
02:29:13.630 --> 02:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
officers yeah thank you this would
 
02:29:16.269 --> 02:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
significantly restrict if not prohibit
 
02:29:17.870 --> 02:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh state and local and County Law
 
02:29:21.670 --> 02:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
Enforcement from enforcing or assisting
 
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh or enforcing even current state law
 
02:29:26.429 --> 02:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
with respect to illicit illegal
 
02:29:28.870 --> 02:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
non-permitted manufacturing growing or
 
02:29:31.030 --> 02:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
dispensing well this talks specifically
 
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
about Federal right so in violation of
 
02:29:37.150 --> 02:29:37.160 align:start position:0%
federal law so it's not enforcing state
 
02:29:39.150 --> 02:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
law it's it's about helping anybody who
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
might be a if if the DEA came in and
 
02:29:44.309 --> 02:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
said we need you to help we we have this
 
02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
giant grow that we know about we want to
 
02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
executed search warrant you would
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
prohibit every law enforcement a agent
 
02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
in the entire state from helping the
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
DEA act on an illicit um enforcement of
 
02:29:59.230 --> 02:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
correct and and there's there's an
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
overarching need to ensure that state
 
02:30:05.269 --> 02:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
and local law enforcement continue to be
 
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
coordinated with federal law enforcement
 
02:30:09.950 --> 02:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
um when those federal law enforcement
 
02:30:13.309 --> 02:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
agents take action Mr
 
02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
chair yeah I understand but but at the
 
02:30:24.750 --> 02:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:27.469 --> 02:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
cannabis yeah Mr chairman I think both
 
02:30:28.990 --> 02:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
the sole purpose and that this is very
 
02:30:30.670 --> 02:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
limiting it's just in compliance with
 
02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
this chapter so we're not talking about
 
02:30:34.710 --> 02:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
marijuana grows that are illegal under
 
02:30:36.269 --> 02:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law we're talking about
 
02:30:39.070 --> 02:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
only situations that are fully legal
 
02:30:41.269 --> 02:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law that they can't
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
participate or Aid the federal
 
02:30:44.670 --> 02:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
government and so I think that's
 
02:30:46.590 --> 02:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
something we would want to have where if
 
02:30:48.269 --> 02:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
something's fully legal under our laws
 
02:30:49.710 --> 02:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
why would we be be supporting the
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
federal government in their attempts to
 
02:30:54.030 --> 02:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
enforce something that's u in compliance
 
02:30:56.269 --> 02:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
with new hampture law this is very
 
02:30:57.710 --> 02:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
limiting language is all I'm trying to
 
02:30:59.469 --> 02:30:59.479 align:start position:0%
say and it's a sole basis and only
 
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
within the confines of what's fully
 
02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
legal in New Hampshire should we could
 
02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
we specify that there has to be state
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
law violation of some
 
02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
sort well again you know um you're
 
02:31:17.550 --> 02:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
you're you're closing the door on an
 
02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate coordination of efforts of
 
02:31:22.110 --> 02:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to enforce federal law
 
02:31:24.030 --> 02:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
that would not be
 
02:31:26.269 --> 02:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
consistent uh or would be inconsistent
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
with state law if there's uh bringing up
 
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
your original comment if there was a 500
 
02:31:34.510 --> 02:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
acre illicit grow and the federal
 
02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
authorities were going to pursue that
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
right um it would be in the state's best
 
02:31:41.990 --> 02:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
interest and the municipality's best
 
02:31:44.309 --> 02:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
interest to participate in that effort
 
02:31:46.030 --> 02:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
that would be fully legal under this
 
02:31:47.950 --> 02:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
definition because well it depends on
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
how you constr the language and the
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
language is it's not in compliance with
 
02:31:53.389 --> 02:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law then it's not in
 
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
compliance with New Hampshire law then
 
02:31:56.510 --> 02:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
they can can then they can work with the
 
02:31:58.910 --> 02:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
federal government so we're limiting
 
02:32:01.230 --> 02:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
here to just what is not in compliance
 
02:32:04.110 --> 02:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire law let's just say
 
02:32:06.030 --> 02:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm operating one the I'm a
 
02:32:08.590 --> 02:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
franchisee and I'm 100% complying with
 
02:32:11.269 --> 02:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
state law could the local law
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement or the county or the state
 
02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
police work with the DEA to close my
 
02:32:17.389 --> 02:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
store down I'm not violating any state
 
02:32:20.790 --> 02:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
law I guess that's the concern is
 
02:32:23.469 --> 02:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
um I see both both sides of it I think
 
02:32:24.830 --> 02:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
as written we can this needs to be
 
02:32:26.830 --> 02:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
cleaned up either way it needs to
 
02:32:28.950 --> 02:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
specify you know there has to be some
 
02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
type of violation of state law but and
 
02:32:35.389 --> 02:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
in that case again I mean we have we
 
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
have enforcement of our state laws so
 
02:32:38.269 --> 02:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
like we would
 
02:32:41.309 --> 02:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
want our enforcement deal with that
 
02:32:43.150 --> 02:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
right but do we want if there's no state
 
02:32:45.389 --> 02:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
law violation are we comfortable not
 
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
just letting that kind of
 
02:32:49.429 --> 02:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
the up up for GRS I guess I also don't
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
want to discourage the the cooperation
 
02:32:53.429 --> 02:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
between local and federal law
 
02:32:55.429 --> 02:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
enforcements I see both
 
02:32:59.110 --> 02:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
eyes Dave um I'm just looking at this as
 
02:33:01.790 --> 02:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
a former Chief of Police in Manchester
 
02:33:05.429 --> 02:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
my reading of this would be when any
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
federal agency comes in and they want to
 
02:33:09.950 --> 02:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh do an operation or they want to do
 
02:33:09.960 --> 02:33:10.990 align:start position:0%
uh do an operation or they want to do
some

02:33:10.990 --> 02:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement I'd be prohibited from
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring it I'd be prohibited from uh
 
02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
being there I have my officers be there
 
02:33:21.389 --> 02:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
um and also prohibited from giving them
 
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
information uh maybe the person might be
 
02:33:25.550 --> 02:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
dangerous that they're dealing with
 
02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
maybe uh for safety purposes we want to
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
tell them do it at this time and do it
 
02:33:31.790 --> 02:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
at that time this just ties the hands of
 
02:33:33.710 --> 02:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement and are we going
 
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
to do this for everything we going to do
 
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
this for immigration when are we going
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
to do this for uh gun uh federal gun
 
02:33:44.590 --> 02:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
control it just opens up a door and
 
02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh I I believe it ties the hands of uh
 
02:33:51.150 --> 02:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
uh local law enforcement officers in the
 
02:33:53.710 --> 02:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
in the Chiefs to be able to control what
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
goes on in their
 
02:33:57.710 --> 02:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities and that's my point with
 
02:34:01.070 --> 02:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
respect to coordination right uh we need
 
02:34:03.269 --> 02:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
to remain coordinated in law enforcement
 
02:34:05.269 --> 02:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
there's unfortunately a lot of cases
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
that we just recently seen in another
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
state where coordination perhaps is is
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
is is more needed and um to former Chief
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
mayor's Point uh there's no Chief in
 
02:34:18.309 --> 02:34:18.319 align:start position:0%
this state that wants Federal
 
02:34:21.150 --> 02:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
authorities to to be operating a a
 
02:34:23.870 --> 02:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous situation in their
 
02:34:27.230 --> 02:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
Community without local law enforcement
 
02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
participation take Frank I say I think
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
if working off what Senator abis was
 
02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
talking about I think if we just clarify
 
02:34:35.070 --> 02:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
that this if it's a violation of state
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
law then that's fully appropriate like
 
02:34:38.750 --> 02:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
we would have no concern with that but I
 
02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
think this is just a public policy
 
02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
statement as well that it's not
 
02:34:44.190 --> 02:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate for you know State actors to
 
02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
be enforcing like a legal franchise
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
going after a legal franchise just if
 
02:34:51.469 --> 02:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
the feds are coming in and trying to do
 
02:34:53.070 --> 02:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
that it would be it would be highly
 
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriate I think for for State
 
02:34:56.670 --> 02:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
actors to be involved in that I guess if
 
02:34:58.670 --> 02:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
the state is the one that's granting the
 
02:35:00.389 --> 02:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:35:03.389 --> 02:35:03.399 align:start position:0%
franchise and then if the state police I
 
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
not saying they're doing it but then the
 
02:35:06.670 --> 02:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
state police then work with the federal
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
government to shut me down
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
basically making my franchise they can
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
take all the inventory they basically
 
02:35:16.269 --> 02:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
put me out of business I'm I'm just I'm
 
02:35:18.429 --> 02:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
not sure the state it's just a conflict
 
02:35:20.190 --> 02:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
there something I'm not saying that
 
02:35:21.990 --> 02:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's what would happen I but I think
 
02:35:23.710 --> 02:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
what the chief saying is also a concern
 
02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
if there going to be a raid or whatever
 
02:35:28.269 --> 02:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
a warrant executed do you want well
 
02:35:30.349 --> 02:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
sorry we can't help you good good luck
 
02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
so can we balance the two of those I I'm
 
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
just I I find it hard to believe the
 
02:35:37.070 --> 02:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
state would be involved I so I get that
 
02:35:38.349 --> 02:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
part of it I
 
02:35:40.349 --> 02:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
get but I don't I don't want any law
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement be end danger than maybe
 
02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's your homework assignment to come
 
02:35:45.070 --> 02:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
up with something that balances the
 
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
interest well I have written sanct
 
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
policies before that have passed and
 
02:35:50.910 --> 02:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
become lost Senator Lang has been giving
 
02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:52.630 align:start position:0%
become lost Senator Lang has been giving
out

02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
my well I I know with with Firearms we
 
02:35:59.429 --> 02:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
made it clear that it had to be um if
 
02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's if it's inconsistent with our state
 
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
law there needs to be something there
 
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
some type of violation but it didn't
 
02:36:05.910 --> 02:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
really address the issue I just brought
 
02:36:07.710 --> 02:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
up because I think it's important to
 
02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
remember here all we're talking about
 
02:36:11.950 --> 02:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
here are State licensed actors and so it
 
02:36:13.710 --> 02:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
would be you know we're assuming that
 
02:36:15.389 --> 02:36:15.399 align:start position:0%
those State act licensed actors are
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
acting in Faith or something like that
 
02:36:18.429 --> 02:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
then they're outside the law then
 
02:36:19.950 --> 02:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
they're not protected but we're
 
02:36:21.150 --> 02:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
literally just talking about State
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
licensed actors
 
02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
here I'm going to give again so again
 
02:36:27.150 --> 02:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government coming in under
 
02:36:29.469 --> 02:36:29.479 align:start position:0%
some sort of broader Rico type of
 
02:36:32.030 --> 02:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
operation right that includes a licensed
 
02:36:33.990 --> 02:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
opery who's working but that his
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
cultivation model may play into the RICO
 
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
Act are we going to tell them cops can't
 
02:36:39.710 --> 02:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
do that because there's not a federal
 
02:36:41.630 --> 02:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
statute he not violating State Statute
 
02:36:43.110 --> 02:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
they're all within they've got a license
 
02:36:46.110 --> 02:36:46.120 align:start position:0%
they're procuring cannabis and the feds
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
come in and go FBI comes in says we're
 
02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
conducting a RICO investigation on this
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis grower because of other issues
 
02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
we want you to help us is are we
 
02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
restricted from helping them no because
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're within they're within they're
 
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
within this statute of Legally growing
 
02:37:03.830 --> 02:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis right so we would say they
 
02:37:07.150 --> 02:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
you've got the you've got the restrictor
 
02:37:09.550 --> 02:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
and that restrictor is very tight IT
 
02:37:12.910 --> 02:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
Deals Only with cannabis products it
 
02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't deal with any other type of
 
02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation and it's very
 
02:37:21.870 --> 02:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
possible that you can have a Reco case
 
02:37:22.910 --> 02:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:37:25.790 --> 02:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
involve a grower it's possible you could
 
02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
have a RICO case involving a uh a
 
02:37:32.269 --> 02:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
grocery store that uh sells beer and
 
02:37:36.190 --> 02:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
wine very possible now in reality would
 
02:37:38.429 --> 02:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
if if something like this where where
 
02:37:41.790 --> 02:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
was doomsday snaro goes down wouldn't
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcer be consulted during the
 
02:37:45.309 --> 02:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
process as well I mean I'm Miss saying
 
02:37:47.070 --> 02:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
because that's that's where I'm well not
 
02:37:48.990 --> 02:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily I mean they don't have to be
 
02:37:50.670 --> 02:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
but I I would assume that they would
 
02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
they well you would assume but not
 
02:37:53.950 --> 02:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily I mean their their resources
 
02:37:56.190 --> 02:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
restricted but the major problem with
 
02:37:59.630 --> 02:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
this section uh and any iteration of it
 
02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
is exactly what Chief mea indicated and
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
that is is that it separates local and
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement from
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
coordinating uh operations that may
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
imperil and impact the public safety of
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
the people that I'm responsible for in
 
02:38:17.309 --> 02:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
my community and that's not a good thing
 
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
ever if I could add if I could add to
 
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
that in these circumstances uh if it's
 
02:38:25.309 --> 02:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
just federal law we're not going to be
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
enforcing it anyway and to say in the
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
way this reads doesn't talk about
 
02:38:32.790 --> 02:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
licensed anybody it just says that
 
02:38:34.830 --> 02:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
anything to do with uh basically
 
02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana that's not a violation of uh
 
02:38:40.710 --> 02:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
state law we can't we can't uh
 
02:38:42.990 --> 02:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
participate in we can't make sure it's a
 
02:38:45.429 --> 02:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
safe situation we can't provide traffic
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
control control around we it ties our
 
02:38:50.830 --> 02:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
hands and it says that local police have
 
02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
no control of the situation this this
 
02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
law just takes everything out of our
 
02:38:57.110 --> 02:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
hands and it's unnecessary because we
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
can't enforce federal law on our own
 
02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:00.429 align:start position:0%
can't enforce federal law on our own
anyway

02:39:00.429 --> 02:39:00.439 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
there the elect commission takes
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
exception to saying the chief saying
 
02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
that the commission's resources are
 
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
limited in any way that's that's sort of
 
02:39:16.030 --> 02:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
gratuitous well we're going to try to
 
02:39:18.349 --> 02:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
help with the re and listen there's more
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
resources to come in I think measuring
 
02:39:22.269 --> 02:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
what you have today this you you have
 
02:39:25.469 --> 02:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
much bigger um much more responsibility
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
so I think I'm talking about five years
 
02:39:29.790 --> 02:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
in the future now so but you know I
 
02:39:31.830 --> 02:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
think in the future I think it's
 
02:39:33.870 --> 02:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that that if you
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
think there's inadequate resources it's
 
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
the legislator job to make sure there is
 
02:39:41.830 --> 02:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
adequate because this a big thing that I
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
am concerned about with a lot of these
 
02:39:45.429 --> 02:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
Canabis bills is the enforceability of
 
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
the laws and if we have someone an
 
02:39:50.990 --> 02:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
entity that's supposed to assign with
 
02:39:52.230 --> 02:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement they need to be have the
 
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
resources to do that I'm just asking
 
02:39:56.030 --> 02:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
assuming they have the resources
 
02:39:57.790 --> 02:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they be contacted before
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's some type of well certainly if
 
02:40:01.630 --> 02:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
it affects an authority under their
 
02:40:05.070 --> 02:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
purview uh they would be um uh contacted
 
02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
for sure uh we contact uh liquor
 
02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
routinely whenever there's violations
 
02:40:12.990 --> 02:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
that we come in contact with or
 
02:40:15.550 --> 02:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
investigate at locations that dis
 
02:40:17.830 --> 02:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
expense liquor that's that's that's
 
02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
normal that's a normal part of law
 
02:40:22.269 --> 02:40:22.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement coordination but my point
 
02:40:24.349 --> 02:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
was to say that there is not a law
 
02:40:26.110 --> 02:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency in this country today
 
02:40:27.910 --> 02:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's not challenged with resources I
 
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't care who it is uh but this
 
02:40:32.469 --> 02:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
particular section has nothing to do
 
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
with resources it has all to do with
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
coordination between agencies and
 
02:40:39.030 --> 02:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
prohibiting Municipal County and state
 
02:40:41.830 --> 02:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement from having an impact on
 
02:40:43.269 --> 02:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
the protection of the citizens that
 
02:40:45.550 --> 02:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for uh in their
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
communities but but I'm asking if if the
 
02:40:50.070 --> 02:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
local police are going to be assisting
 
02:40:52.230 --> 02:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
the federal agents in executing a
 
02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
warrant which I assume there was would
 
02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
have been some investigation done and
 
02:40:57.870 --> 02:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's really only a violation of federal
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
law there's no state law violation I'm
 
02:41:01.870 --> 02:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
just asking wouldn't I I would be
 
02:41:04.469 --> 02:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
surprised to know that liquor wasn't
 
02:41:04.479 --> 02:41:05.990 align:start position:0%
surprised to know that liquor wasn't
notified

02:41:05.990 --> 02:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
notified
 
02:41:08.670 --> 02:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
of that or they wouldn't be notified in
 
02:41:10.469 --> 02:41:10.479 align:start position:0%
that's if you're presuming that it's a
 
02:41:13.070 --> 02:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
federal investigation they will advise
 
02:41:15.070 --> 02:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
who they want to advise they don't even
 
02:41:16.830 --> 02:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
have to advis the municipalities when
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
they come in they do so as a matter of
 
02:41:20.790 --> 02:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
courtesy uh because they have
 
02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
overarching authority within the state
 
02:41:23.550 --> 02:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire because State of New
 
02:41:25.389 --> 02:41:25.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is within the United States
 
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
clearly so I think again before we go
 
02:41:30.190 --> 02:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
too far down rapital so
 
02:41:33.269 --> 02:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
Dave me I I
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
can as as a chief if a federal agency
 
02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
would come into the City and they would
 
02:41:41.550 --> 02:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
conduct any kind of raid or make any
 
02:41:44.429 --> 02:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
kind of arrest that wasn't
 
02:41:47.630 --> 02:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
just that that didn't cause a safety
 
02:41:50.230 --> 02:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
issue but if if there would be held to
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
pay because I would call that agency and
 
02:41:54.750 --> 02:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
I would demand that next time they come
 
02:41:56.790 --> 02:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
in that they let us know they're going
 
02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
to be there so we we're apprised of that
 
02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
I can think of another situation that's
 
02:42:04.269 --> 02:42:04.279 align:start position:0%
a violation of federal law but it isn't
 
02:42:06.710 --> 02:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
a violation of state law right somebody
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
um if if somebody is a uh legally uh
 
02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
owns guns and they have marijuana on
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
them that's a fragile offense there's so
 
02:42:21.950 --> 02:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
many things that go back and forth here
 
02:42:25.790 --> 02:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
but this this is basically just taking
 
02:42:28.269 --> 02:42:28.279 align:start position:0%
any taking the authority and any power
 
02:42:31.150 --> 02:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
from local police and I don't think we
 
02:42:34.269 --> 02:42:34.279 align:start position:0%
should be mandating what police can and
 
02:42:37.030 --> 02:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
can't do outside of what we we already
 
02:42:39.070 --> 02:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
have and what is constitu let's do this
 
02:42:41.070 --> 02:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
let's let's darl why don't you do your
 
02:42:43.070 --> 02:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
homework assignment and rewrite this
 
02:42:44.510 --> 02:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
other people have had their hands up so
 
02:42:46.269 --> 02:42:46.279 align:start position:0%
it would be next
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
remember you all voted me the chair
 
02:42:50.190 --> 02:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
unanimously listen I I want to make sure
 
02:42:51.550 --> 02:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
because we can I think we there's a
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
chance we can balance this if there is
 
02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
if not then we'll put it to vot of
 
02:42:58.950 --> 02:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee yeah I think and I think Chief
 
02:43:00.510 --> 02:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
to to your point I think what we were
 
02:43:02.389 --> 02:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
talking about here are only licensed
 
02:43:05.230 --> 02:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
because this is only protecting agency
 
02:43:07.429 --> 02:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
or entities that would either be a grow
 
02:43:09.190 --> 02:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
that has a license to be a grower a
 
02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
seller that has a license to be a seller
 
02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
so if if feds are going this would only
 
02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
limit cooperation in those narrow
 
02:43:17.790 --> 02:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
instances so if the federal government
 
02:43:19.309 --> 02:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
is coming in and going after one of
 
02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
those entities it would be be it would
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
and and the state entity or the local
 
02:43:26.389 --> 02:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
entity weren't allowed to engage in that
 
02:43:29.070 --> 02:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
process it would only be if that local
 
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
if that um franchisee is fully compliant
 
02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire law doing nothing
 
02:43:35.910 --> 02:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
wrong and the federal government still
 
02:43:38.309 --> 02:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
wants to go after them then the state
 
02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't participate so talk super see
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
that there there's there strange
 
02:43:46.269 --> 02:43:46.279 align:start position:0%
situations that occur and in your
 
02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
example Chief
 
02:43:51.349 --> 02:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's from the AG's office so just to
 
02:43:55.309 --> 02:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
that point this is in 318 F2 so this is
 
02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
um this isn't referring to or isn't in
 
02:44:02.670 --> 02:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
the same title as the rest of the uh the
 
02:44:06.429 --> 02:44:06.439 align:start position:0%
bill um I think that what how this could
 
02:44:09.389 --> 02:44:09.399 align:start position:0%
be read would be anybody who is for
 
02:44:11.790 --> 02:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
example in in 1A possessing consuming or
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
using regardless of source uh because
 
02:44:15.630 --> 02:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
it's not defining what whether or not
 
02:44:18.349 --> 02:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
it's in compliance so um the the
 
02:44:21.670 --> 02:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
Assumption in two relating to uh law
 
02:44:23.910 --> 02:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh restriction on being able
 
02:44:27.150 --> 02:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
to engage uh you'd have to Define well
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
what's the source in order to understand
 
02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
that you'd have to to understand the
 
02:44:34.309 --> 02:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
entirity of the federal action um of
 
02:44:36.590 --> 02:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
whether there are any charges outside of
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
what would be in compliance which is
 
02:44:40.990 --> 02:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
just possession or or consumption here
 
02:44:43.389 --> 02:44:43.399 align:start position:0%
uh and know that before you would be
 
02:44:45.309 --> 02:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
having to make a call about whether you
 
02:44:48.429 --> 02:44:48.439 align:start position:0%
be uh violating the section by providing
 
02:44:51.150 --> 02:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
any Aid or failing to provide any Aid so
 
02:44:53.590 --> 02:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
I think that this is at risk of being
 
02:44:59.150 --> 02:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
over inclusive over broad by um sort of
 
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
having an incentive for law enforcement
 
02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
to not engage even if there is a basis
 
02:45:05.269 --> 02:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
or there's a belief that that it
 
02:45:07.349 --> 02:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be covered just the language
 
02:45:09.910 --> 02:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
itself is is Broad and I think we'd be
 
02:45:11.429 --> 02:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
fine with that if there's any I mean if
 
02:45:13.750 --> 02:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
there is concern that this is not fully
 
02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
clear in this section we'd be fine with
 
02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
that and clarifying that we're only
 
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about going after or using
 
02:45:21.309 --> 02:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
this as a pretext to go after things
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
that are fully legal in New Hampshire
 
02:45:24.710 --> 02:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
and so I think anything we can do to
 
02:45:25.870 --> 02:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
clarify that would be totally
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate from our perspective
 
02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
homework assignment and if you don't
 
02:45:31.750 --> 02:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
mind I know we passed a bill similar
 
02:45:34.309 --> 02:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
when it relate to Firearms maybe compare
 
02:45:35.710 --> 02:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
the two see if there's anything needs to
 
02:45:37.870 --> 02:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
be looked at that would require an
 
02:45:41.070 --> 02:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
independent violation of state law and
 
02:45:42.910 --> 02:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
we can discuss that more give everyone
 
02:45:45.429 --> 02:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
some time to digest it but that's
 
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
already the existing law so we do have
 
02:45:49.469 --> 02:45:49.479 align:start position:0%
something on the books but maybe we can
 
02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
put something in there to address liquor
 
02:45:53.269 --> 02:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement as well if it's if they're
 
02:45:54.269 --> 02:45:54.279 align:start position:0%
going to be involved we need to make
 
02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
sure everyone's on the same page but I'm
 
02:45:58.349 --> 02:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
you know I'm going to reserve know an
 
02:46:02.469 --> 02:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:05.630 --> 02:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
now so we're on do you guys want to go
 
02:46:07.030 --> 02:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
for a couple more minutes or we said
 
02:46:08.469 --> 02:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to be down around 12:30
 
02:46:10.110 --> 02:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
originally trying to wrap up or do you
 
02:46:12.750 --> 02:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
want to go until 1:00 uh smoking or
 
02:46:15.750 --> 02:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
vaping cannabis in public I get some
 
02:46:17.550 --> 02:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
that might get animated too so I that's
 
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
something we might want I think we just
 
02:46:20.349 --> 02:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
we just go with it if we don't come with
 
02:46:22.710 --> 02:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
the conclusion so no person shall smoke
 
02:46:24.389 --> 02:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
or vaporized cannabis in an area
 
02:46:26.389 --> 02:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public any person who
 
02:46:28.389 --> 02:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
violates this SE section shall be guilty
 
02:46:30.389 --> 02:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
of a violation maybe find not more than
 
02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
$500 and shall forfeit all cannabis and
 
02:46:35.790 --> 02:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis products so new Futures
 
02:46:38.269 --> 02:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
suggested retaining this but add but
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
making the penalty
 
02:46:43.870 --> 02:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
$100 and they said to be consistent with
 
02:46:49.070 --> 02:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:53.389 --> 02:46:53.399 align:start position:0%
act why would we want toce penalty um I
 
02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
was reading that in um
 
02:47:00.030 --> 02:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
Quebec this is a deterrent their minimum
 
02:47:03.469 --> 02:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
is $1,200 and the maximum is
 
02:47:08.190 --> 02:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
$4,500 in violation of this um
 
02:47:10.030 --> 02:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
public I kind of wanted to be a
 
02:47:12.710 --> 02:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I a Class B misdemeanor so
 
02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
if I can that's just me so my
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation was to change this from a
 
02:47:19.110 --> 02:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
violation to a misdemeanor a be
 
02:47:22.269 --> 02:47:22.279 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor on the First Defense and for
 
02:47:24.790 --> 02:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
and have that same L leave it at $500 up
 
02:47:27.790 --> 02:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
to right uh $500 it could still be $100
 
02:47:29.389 --> 02:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
if they if the judge shows but then I
 
02:47:33.309 --> 02:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
want um and a misdemeanor and up to
 
02:47:35.870 --> 02:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
$2,000 for a second violation within
 
02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:38.070 align:start position:0%
$2,000 for a second violation within
three

02:47:38.070 --> 02:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:47:40.710 --> 02:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
years I I would I would concur with that
 
02:47:43.389 --> 02:47:43.399 align:start position:0%
and should we should we set a minimum
 
02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
threshold and sh be not less than 500 or
 
02:47:50.590 --> 02:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:52.990 --> 02:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
250 I'd want to I'd want to leave it for
 
02:47:55.030 --> 02:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
mitigating circumstances that a judge
 
02:47:57.230 --> 02:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
may be able to consider so have maximum
 
02:47:59.389 --> 02:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
fine the judge can adjust the fine based
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
on mitigating or aggravating
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances you're thank you I I don't
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
support further criminalization I think
 
02:48:08.590 --> 02:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
we have a our leading Public Health uh
 
02:48:11.910 --> 02:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
organization in New Hampshire actually
 
02:48:14.510 --> 02:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting suggesting a decrease in the
 
02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:15.550 align:start position:0%
suggesting suggesting a decrease in the
penal

02:48:15.550 --> 02:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
penal
 
02:48:18.070 --> 02:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
because I think they readily
 
02:48:20.230 --> 02:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh understand that the evidence doesn't
 
02:48:21.710 --> 02:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
show that criminalizing this type of
 
02:48:24.070 --> 02:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
behavior is effective so I would fully
 
02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
support new Future's recommendation to
 
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
put it down to $100 to be consistent
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
with existing law I just I wouldn't I
 
02:48:33.550 --> 02:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
think the policy behind of a lot of our
 
02:48:37.469 --> 02:48:37.479 align:start position:0%
work here is to do to have less people
 
02:48:39.790 --> 02:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh be commit committing crimes and I
 
02:48:41.429 --> 02:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
think we we're going against sort of the
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
policy thrust of this entire work if
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to just um create more
 
02:48:49.550 --> 02:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
crimes here how do we deter public use I
 
02:48:51.750 --> 02:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
just I mean I mean I I'll give you an
 
02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
example I was in Salem M respond to you
 
02:48:55.269 --> 02:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
hear me out in Salem Massachusetts I was
 
02:48:57.990 --> 02:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
there and I parked in the parking garage
 
02:48:59.590 --> 02:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
it was two weeks before Halloween real
 
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
fun in the stairway in the morning it's
 
02:49:03.469 --> 02:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
my remind you it's like 9:00 in the
 
02:49:04.389 --> 02:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
morning people are smoking in the
 
02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
stairway in the par parking lot I'm
 
02:49:07.309 --> 02:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
worried about walking into a court now
 
02:49:09.950 --> 02:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
smelling like canvas that but I'm also
 
02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
walking by then it's different people
 
02:49:14.269 --> 02:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
when I'm going to leave a couple hours
 
02:49:16.110 --> 02:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
later there's other people smoking that
 
02:49:17.710 --> 02:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
so there's when I say public use is a
 
02:49:19.550 --> 02:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
problem when I ate lunch outside I could
 
02:49:22.150 --> 02:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
also smell it now there I'm just
 
02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
pointing out is I don't think whatever
 
02:49:26.429 --> 02:49:26.439 align:start position:0%
deterrent system they have going on
 
02:49:28.710 --> 02:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
there is working very well and when I
 
02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
say that that's happening it's Halloween
 
02:49:33.030 --> 02:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
season there are families and kids
 
02:49:35.990 --> 02:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
around everywhere so that's the biggest
 
02:49:40.389 --> 02:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
concern I have is is a violation of a
 
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
$100 is that signif is that going to be
 
02:49:46.030 --> 02:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
a deterrent I don't know I mean no so
 
02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
just to I just was G to respond yeah I
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
was going to respond to that I mean so
 
02:49:51.190 --> 02:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
new Futures as a Public Health
 
02:49:54.349 --> 02:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
Organization they you know they are
 
02:49:57.389 --> 02:49:57.399 align:start position:0%
aware of the effective Public Health
 
02:49:59.870 --> 02:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
deterrent mechanisms and they are
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
recommending a reduction rather than
 
02:50:05.030 --> 02:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
increasing of criminalization so both
 
02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
recognizing what is an effective
 
02:50:09.950 --> 02:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
deterrent is not criminalization and I I
 
02:50:12.990 --> 02:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
would strongly you know if if there is
 
02:50:14.950 --> 02:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
evidence that further criminalization is
 
02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
an effective deterrent I would welcome
 
02:50:21.389 --> 02:50:21.399 align:start position:0%
that and perhaps perhaps something the
 
02:50:23.830 --> 02:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
effect of I think it's important if you
 
02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:24.670 align:start position:0%
effect of I think it's important if you
have

02:50:24.670 --> 02:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:50:28.150 --> 02:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
somebody especially if that person is uh
 
02:50:32.229 --> 02:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps um has some Public public uh
 
02:50:35.710 --> 02:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
service aspect to it maybe or has a uh
 
02:50:37.550 --> 02:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
take a mandatory
 
02:50:39.790 --> 02:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
class about
 
02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
marijuana or something to that nature
 
02:50:44.349 --> 02:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
but you need to get to coni conviction
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
and violation offenses you know what are
 
02:50:49.469 --> 02:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
we what are we dealing with here um
 
02:50:53.309 --> 02:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
believe me I'm to me it doesn't it
 
02:50:54.670 --> 02:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't I'm going against probably my
 
02:50:55.870 --> 02:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues but it doesn't feel right to
 
02:50:59.510 --> 02:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
me that if the product is legal to use
 
02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
but then we're making it a misdemeanor
 
02:51:02.950 --> 02:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
if they use it twice in
 
02:51:06.510 --> 02:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
public it doesn't you it's but this is
 
02:51:08.590 --> 02:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
deterring public use you can own a car
 
02:51:10.070 --> 02:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
but there's there's certain things you
 
02:51:12.429 --> 02:51:12.439 align:start position:0%
can and can't do with it you can so I I
 
02:51:14.229 --> 02:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
guess how do we the biggest concern I
 
02:51:16.870 --> 02:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
hear is the states that have legalized
 
02:51:20.349 --> 02:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
that the public use is absurd and the
 
02:51:22.309 --> 02:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
states I've been to Old Orchard Beach I
 
02:51:25.150 --> 02:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
was there for a week every everywhere I
 
02:51:26.590 --> 02:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
kept count of how many times you could
 
02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
smell it in one day again there's kids
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere I I mean I'm with my own kids
 
02:51:32.429 --> 02:51:32.439 align:start position:0%
when you don't want to make public
 
02:51:35.190 --> 02:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
policy on on you know sort of anecdotal
 
02:51:36.910 --> 02:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
evidence you want to make public policy
 
02:51:39.030 --> 02:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
based on evidence and if someone wants
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
to present the evidence that
 
02:51:42.229 --> 02:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
criminalizing this is going to be a
 
02:51:44.950 --> 02:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
deterrent that that I would welcome that
 
02:51:47.349 --> 02:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
but like the whole idea of this work is
 
02:51:50.190 --> 02:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
to decriminalize and pre and prevent
 
02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
less crime so I could not support any
 
02:51:55.110 --> 02:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
provision in here that would create a
 
02:51:57.590 --> 02:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
brand new crime I can't Point all what's
 
02:52:00.550 --> 02:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
the point of the $100 find if I
 
02:52:04.550 --> 02:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
may yeah it's well it's consistent with
 
02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:05.830 align:start position:0%
may yeah it's well it's consistent with
existing

02:52:05.830 --> 02:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
existing
 
02:52:09.070 --> 02:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
law so I have a question for
 
02:52:13.309 --> 02:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
Matt question Matt is yep yep so in a
 
02:52:15.309 --> 02:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
public consumption area
 
02:52:17.790 --> 02:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
if it's allowed and not
 
02:52:20.349 --> 02:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
deterred unlike smoking which would
 
02:52:23.990 --> 02:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
never have me possibly test positive for
 
02:52:26.110 --> 02:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
controlled substance could you test
 
02:52:28.469 --> 02:52:28.479 align:start position:0%
positive being in a public area and
 
02:52:29.950 --> 02:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
somebody else is consuming and you're
 
02:52:31.750 --> 02:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
inhaling is there any possible way for
 
02:52:32.910 --> 02:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
you to test
 
02:52:35.229 --> 02:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
positive I'm sorry Senator I can't
 
02:52:37.110 --> 02:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
answer that question it seems unlikely
 
02:52:39.469 --> 02:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
but I don't know okay someone's got
 
02:52:41.190 --> 02:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
their head raised right behind I wasn't
 
02:52:41.200 --> 02:52:42.550 align:start position:0%
their head raised right behind I wasn't
I

02:52:42.550 --> 02:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:52:45.229 --> 02:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
was on this there's a doctor we'll ask
 
02:52:45.239 --> 02:52:46.349 align:start position:0%
was on this there's a doctor we'll ask
the

02:52:46.349 --> 02:52:46.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:52:48.830 --> 02:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
doctor on your specific question there's
 
02:52:50.790 --> 02:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
one study of police officers who were
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
stationed at um who like who were doing
 
02:52:54.790 --> 02:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
extra time at concerts and places where
 
02:52:56.910 --> 02:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
there was outdoor consumption and I
 
02:52:58.750 --> 02:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
think uh I I don't have the study with
 
02:52:59.950 --> 02:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
me I think about a third of them
 
02:53:02.309 --> 02:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
actually tested positive afterwards so
 
02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
you do get secondhand smoke effects even
 
02:53:07.630 --> 02:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
in outdoor spaces um that they're not
 
02:53:09.750 --> 02:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
getting high but they sometimes s
 
02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
suffered some effects I I did want to
 
02:53:13.510 --> 02:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
note you may want to make sure that the
 
02:53:16.550 --> 02:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
language uh doesn't allow smoking in any
 
02:53:18.429 --> 02:53:18.439 align:start position:0%
place where tobacco is not currently
 
02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
allowed so just to make sure it's
 
02:53:23.150 --> 02:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
covering um workplaces um and other
 
02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
settings that may not be public places
 
02:53:28.510 --> 02:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
um but I do concur with Mr Mara and
 
02:53:30.910 --> 02:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
other concerns about using community
 
02:53:32.670 --> 02:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
service or other approaches that don't
 
02:53:34.550 --> 02:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
get people into civil debt because you
 
02:53:35.870 --> 02:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
know then if you don't can't pay the
 
02:53:37.790 --> 02:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
fine and you end up losing your driver's
 
02:53:39.190 --> 02:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
license so there're sometimes those
 
02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of Cycles happening too so thank
 
02:53:44.030 --> 02:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
you doctor so again my point of having a
 
02:53:46.229 --> 02:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor a B misdemeanor and a
 
02:53:47.790 --> 02:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor is because you're putting at
 
02:53:50.670 --> 02:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
risk the general public for possible
 
02:53:52.830 --> 02:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
loss of job because I was around
 
02:53:54.590 --> 02:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere and someone publicly smoking
 
02:53:56.990 --> 02:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
and I test positive and I have a CDL
 
02:53:58.950 --> 02:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
license and now I go get a I get
 
02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
randomly drug tested by my employer and
 
02:54:03.269 --> 02:54:03.279 align:start position:0%
now I lose my job because public
 
02:54:05.389 --> 02:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
consumption occurred I want to deter
 
02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
public consumption as much as possible
 
02:54:09.630 --> 02:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
and make it a serious off fense so
 
02:54:11.190 --> 02:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
people understand that you're not just
 
02:54:12.910 --> 02:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
putting yourself at risk when it comes
 
02:54:14.790 --> 02:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
to legalization you want a smoke in your
 
02:54:17.469 --> 02:54:17.479 align:start position:0%
home have at it I don't care but the
 
02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
idea that you can smoke publicly and
 
02:54:21.830 --> 02:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
potentially cost a police officer's job
 
02:54:24.429 --> 02:54:24.439 align:start position:0%
firemen is job a school teacher there
 
02:54:26.670 --> 02:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
job because of randomized drug
 
02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
testing I I think we need to be more um
 
02:54:33.550 --> 02:54:33.560 align:start position:0%
en have more enforcement for that
 
02:54:36.830 --> 02:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
reason and again I'm I'm I'm I agree
 
02:54:38.229 --> 02:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
with what you're saying it's just to me
 
02:54:42.670 --> 02:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
it just seems like it's a it's legal if
 
02:54:45.630 --> 02:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
if it's legal to possess marij Iana and
 
02:54:49.630 --> 02:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
then we we get somebody smoking it twice
 
02:54:52.830 --> 02:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
it just seems out of proportion
 
02:54:55.870 --> 02:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
that it's like open container
 
02:54:58.830 --> 02:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
or but plus we'd have to get the uh plus
 
02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
we'd have to get the marijuana tested MH
 
02:55:03.229 --> 02:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
and we're back to the same situation
 
02:55:04.750 --> 02:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
where we're arresting people we're
 
02:55:05.950 --> 02:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
taking the product we're send it up to
 
02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
the lab I just don't want to make a uh
 
02:55:11.870 --> 02:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't it just seems out of
 
02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
proportion I'm not it's already been
 
02:55:17.110 --> 02:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
well the good news
 
02:55:19.710 --> 02:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
is let me just think about
 
02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
this in order to prevent people from
 
02:55:24.830 --> 02:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
smoking in public how do we do it we say
 
02:55:26.910 --> 02:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
we recommend don't do it but if there's
 
02:55:30.030 --> 02:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
no penalty for doing it $100
 
02:55:32.070 --> 02:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
fine I'm
 
02:55:35.750 --> 02:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
just is that going to work and is that
 
02:55:37.349 --> 02:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
worth the enfor the enforcement side
 
02:55:38.710 --> 02:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
let's go up if people just walking
 
02:55:41.710 --> 02:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
around smoking that because all we this
 
02:55:44.309 --> 02:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
we're just saying no public use period
 
02:55:47.950 --> 02:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
no exception right how do we stop people
 
02:55:51.150 --> 02:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
from doing that being forced right I
 
02:55:53.790 --> 02:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
think you have a graduated
 
02:55:57.070 --> 02:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
fine and if they and if the people if
 
02:56:00.030 --> 02:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
they don't pay the fine uh then you file
 
02:56:02.590 --> 02:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
a motion for contempt would
 
02:56:07.229 --> 02:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
then but to to me to me making like I
 
02:56:09.790 --> 02:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
said it's if it's legal for somebody to
 
02:56:13.349 --> 02:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
possess it and if there there's and we
 
02:56:15.389 --> 02:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
catch them using it twice in a public
 
02:56:18.550 --> 02:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
place it just it just as a police
 
02:56:19.990 --> 02:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
officer just seems out of proportion but
 
02:56:21.389 --> 02:56:21.399 align:start position:0%
that's the lack of deterrence they
 
02:56:23.389 --> 02:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
they've done it now twice well that's
 
02:56:24.950 --> 02:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
why you have to have the the the
 
02:56:28.229 --> 02:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
graduated fines so I would support a
 
02:56:30.349 --> 02:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
graduated fine over the creation of a
 
02:56:32.590 --> 02:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I I I could never support a
 
02:56:34.670 --> 02:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
bill where we're doing further
 
02:56:37.030 --> 02:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
criminalization it's already if you're
 
02:56:38.510 --> 02:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
smoking in public what happens if you're
 
02:56:40.349 --> 02:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
smoking a joint in public space right
 
02:56:41.229 --> 02:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
now what
 
02:56:44.429 --> 02:56:44.439 align:start position:0%
happens what's what's the penalty so so
 
02:56:47.349 --> 02:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
M Mr chair I think if I may the the
 
02:56:50.990 --> 02:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
question turns on what is necessary to
 
02:56:54.790 --> 02:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
deter which is your point and uh how do
 
02:56:57.190 --> 02:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
we balance that against uh whether or
 
02:56:58.870 --> 02:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
not we criminalize or
 
02:57:02.790 --> 02:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
decriminalize and um I think that the
 
02:57:06.469 --> 02:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
the the best balance to go forward is to
 
02:57:08.990 --> 02:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
start with a mandatory minimum fine that
 
02:57:11.229 --> 02:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
is some that is
 
02:57:15.309 --> 02:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
somewhat pricey enough to DET people if
 
02:57:18.990 --> 02:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's not the cost of a gas tank tank of
 
02:57:20.910 --> 02:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
gas it's not going to deter people well
 
02:57:22.710 --> 02:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
you lose so I would start with a minimum
 
02:57:26.469 --> 02:57:26.479 align:start position:0%
$250 fine and then work up from there as
 
02:57:28.990 --> 02:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
a deterrent but you also lose your um
 
02:57:30.790 --> 02:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
you have to forfeit your cannabis and
 
02:57:33.670 --> 02:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis products that that when I put
 
02:57:35.630 --> 02:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
that original I didn't write this exact
 
02:57:37.590 --> 02:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
one but when I kind of came up with that
 
02:57:40.630 --> 02:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
the for was part of the deterrence so
 
02:57:41.950 --> 02:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
that would maybe help with your civil
 
02:57:45.510 --> 02:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
fine but I I'm just wondering if a
 
02:57:46.870 --> 02:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
person is going to be doing it multiple
 
02:57:48.990 --> 02:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
times even if the first offense was a
 
02:57:50.469 --> 02:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
violation why would the second one not
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
be be misdemeanor well I again I would
 
02:57:55.070 --> 02:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
offer that you start at a minimum fine
 
02:57:58.269 --> 02:57:58.279 align:start position:0%
of 250 the second fine could be
 
02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
$500 and um and then whatever else if
 
02:58:03.910 --> 02:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
there's a third offense then uh then you
 
02:58:06.630 --> 02:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
might want to start obviously you've
 
02:58:09.229 --> 02:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
developed history that the individual
 
02:58:11.590 --> 02:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
involved in this is clearly flaunting
 
02:58:14.309 --> 02:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
the law has no uh intention to follow
 
02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
the law and after three times well
 
02:58:18.910 --> 02:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps then you enter into the realm of
 
02:58:21.229 --> 02:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
a be
 
02:58:23.190 --> 02:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor but start with a minimum
 
02:58:26.590 --> 02:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
find that somewhat consequential again
 
02:58:28.990 --> 02:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
remember the in this statue that we're
 
02:58:31.110 --> 02:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
still still leing the conversation says
 
02:58:34.510 --> 02:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
maybe fine not more right so we're only
 
02:58:36.590 --> 02:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
setting an upper limit to allow judges
 
02:58:38.229 --> 02:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
who want to do diversion programs and
 
02:58:39.670 --> 02:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
allow them to take a class you it's like
 
02:58:42.070 --> 02:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
a motor vehicle violation right if I get
 
02:58:43.389 --> 02:58:43.399 align:start position:0%
if I get a speeding ticket I get the
 
02:58:45.389 --> 02:58:45.399 align:start position:0%
right to go take a class and the judge
 
02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
will set aside my conviction if I want
 
02:58:49.870 --> 02:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
this allows for that still to occur it
 
02:58:51.550 --> 02:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't set a minimum mandatory it
 
02:58:53.830 --> 02:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
allows for the fact that if you get
 
02:58:55.670 --> 02:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
caught the first time you can be subject
 
02:58:57.750 --> 02:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
up to a $500 fine but then up to the
 
02:59:00.030 --> 02:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
judge to mitigate that if he chooses to
 
02:59:02.349 --> 02:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason um he can choose to
 
02:59:04.229 --> 02:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
have you take a class he could choose to
 
02:59:06.950 --> 02:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
set a $100 fine versus a $500 fine the
 
02:59:08.910 --> 02:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
judge will make that determination and
 
02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
the same with the a misdemeanor again
 
02:59:12.710 --> 02:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
here's a case where you've already been
 
02:59:14.469 --> 02:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
warned that's against the law to do
 
02:59:15.870 --> 02:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
something and then you do it again
 
02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
anyway and so of course you want a
 
02:59:19.910 --> 02:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
heavier penalty and a heavier fine for
 
02:59:21.750 --> 02:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
that because you're just blatantly
 
02:59:24.150 --> 02:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
ignoring the law after being warned that
 
02:59:25.630 --> 02:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's already against the law to
 
02:59:27.510 --> 02:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
smoke in public so yeah I want a heavier
 
02:59:29.910 --> 02:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
fine and I want a heavier um inter
 
02:59:31.830 --> 02:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
determination but again it still leaves
 
02:59:34.750 --> 02:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
to it up to a $2,000 fine which is what
 
02:59:37.990 --> 02:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
an a misdemeanor is allowed um but it
 
02:59:41.670 --> 02:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't mandate that those fine levels
 
02:59:44.950 --> 02:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
either I think um
 
02:59:46.389 --> 02:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
we I think we'd also obviously have
 
02:59:48.790 --> 02:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
concerns with uh criminalizing in this
 
02:59:50.990 --> 02:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
respect um I think we would not love but
 
02:59:53.269 --> 02:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
I think would support the graduated fine
 
02:59:55.269 --> 02:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
idea I but I do think it's really
 
02:59:57.389 --> 02:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
important to have to not allow for a
 
02:59:59.590 --> 02:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
minimum uh but to have the not more than
 
03:00:01.950 --> 03:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
language I when I was working in Alabama
 
03:00:03.750 --> 03:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
we did a study on fines and fees with
 
03:00:06.389 --> 03:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
the University of Alabama Birmingham um
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
and what we found was that over eight
 
03:00:12.229 --> 03:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
and 10 people um who had court debt um
 
03:00:13.750 --> 03:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
were actually giving up basic necess
 
03:00:16.670 --> 03:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
ities like food and medicine because the
 
03:00:18.190 --> 03:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
penalties for not paying down your court
 
03:00:19.790 --> 03:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
debt like driver's license suspension
 
03:00:22.150 --> 03:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
Etc were so severe and so I think you
 
03:00:23.990 --> 03:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
know it's important to always have a
 
03:00:26.150 --> 03:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
mechanism in there for the court to look
 
03:00:28.309 --> 03:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
at whether someone can pay or not and to
 
03:00:31.710 --> 03:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
have appropriate resp two
 
03:00:34.229 --> 03:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
things I I I appreciate what's being
 
03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
said here and I I understand I would
 
03:00:39.030 --> 03:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
hate to see someone you know not feeding
 
03:00:40.670 --> 03:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
their kids because they have to pay a
 
03:00:44.229 --> 03:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
court fine to violate this law you
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
you're not doing it by accident you are
 
03:00:47.870 --> 03:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
this is something that you have to go
 
03:00:49.710 --> 03:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
out of your way to violate so I as much
 
03:00:52.190 --> 03:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
as I sympathize from the financial
 
03:00:54.750 --> 03:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
aspect you have to think about there's a
 
03:00:56.269 --> 03:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
lot you had to do in your own mind to
 
03:00:57.790 --> 03:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
violate this it's not something you just
 
03:01:00.429 --> 03:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
do by accident with that being said if
 
03:01:02.750 --> 03:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's a violation offense and I would
 
03:01:04.229 --> 03:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
never do this maybe Senator we'll use
 
03:01:05.469 --> 03:01:05.479 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang as an example if he's
 
03:01:08.710 --> 03:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
smoking in a public place and a police
 
03:01:10.469 --> 03:01:10.479 align:start position:0%
officer comes up and gives him his
 
03:01:12.790 --> 03:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
ticket but he doesn't stop smoking what
 
03:01:15.269 --> 03:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
happens no I'm just saying that he he
 
03:01:17.469 --> 03:01:17.479 align:start position:0%
can just keep well you got to stop well
 
03:01:19.229 --> 03:01:19.239 align:start position:0%
here's your second ticket or is it the
 
03:01:20.710 --> 03:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
same act I don't know I mean I'm just
 
03:01:22.550 --> 03:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
saying people are
 
03:01:24.590 --> 03:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
smoking you can't I'm not even sure a
 
03:01:25.950 --> 03:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
police officer can stop them in the
 
03:01:27.950 --> 03:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
middle of what they're doing unless
 
03:01:29.309 --> 03:01:29.319 align:start position:0%
there's some other way out of it that's
 
03:01:31.309 --> 03:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
my point is that you can't really stop
 
03:01:33.510 --> 03:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
it if it's only a violation offense yeah
 
03:01:34.910 --> 03:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
you can take their stuff I guess you
 
03:01:36.550 --> 03:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
have to like take everything out of the
 
03:01:38.670 --> 03:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
hand well right it would be it would
 
03:01:40.510 --> 03:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
result in the seizure of of any other
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
product that they may have on their
 
03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:44.790 align:start position:0%
product that they may have on their
person

03:01:44.790 --> 03:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:01:46.590 --> 03:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair sorry sorry I stepped
 
03:01:47.630 --> 03:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
out for a few minutes I might have
 
03:01:49.910 --> 03:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
missed some of this conversation but my
 
03:01:51.830 --> 03:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
question to you guys and maybe the chief
 
03:01:54.110 --> 03:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
is what happens when someone's um
 
03:01:55.870 --> 03:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
drinking open containers at Hampton
 
03:01:58.389 --> 03:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
Beach they get their alcohol taken
 
03:02:00.750 --> 03:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
what's the find for that what's the
 
03:02:03.790 --> 03:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
crime it's it's $100 it should it should
 
03:02:06.389 --> 03:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
be more that's an argument to be made
 
03:02:09.349 --> 03:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
but I think I think the the $100 fine is
 
03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
consistent with the alcohol that's where
 
03:02:13.950 --> 03:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
something could come wrong with that I
 
03:02:15.790 --> 03:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
think that's where it's coming together
 
03:02:17.950 --> 03:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
at that point well what I'll say to that
 
03:02:21.190 --> 03:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
is you drinking a beer at Hampton Beach
 
03:02:24.030 --> 03:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't get me drunk but you smoking a
 
03:02:25.630 --> 03:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
bunch of weed at Hampton Beach could get
 
03:02:27.910 --> 03:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
me high and I don't want that in my
 
03:02:29.389 --> 03:02:29.399 align:start position:0%
system and neither do a bunch of kids
 
03:02:31.790 --> 03:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
playing at the beach um we we have an
 
03:02:33.269 --> 03:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
obligation to make sure businesses
 
03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
aren't affected in like say in
 
03:02:36.950 --> 03:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester you go you go down on on the
 
03:02:38.469 --> 03:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
strip in Manchester and stop by
 
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
businesses you you you sit outside
 
03:02:43.309 --> 03:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
having dinner and you're getting high
 
03:02:44.510 --> 03:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're getting secondhand smoke
 
03:02:45.950 --> 03:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
100% that's what's going on right now I
 
03:02:48.510 --> 03:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
go down there for dinner all the time so
 
03:02:51.429 --> 03:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
we have an obligation to put strong
 
03:02:54.190 --> 03:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
controls so that we we protect our state
 
03:02:56.590 --> 03:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
I mean this isn't Alabama or California
 
03:02:57.910 --> 03:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
with with all due respect this is New
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we're here to protect our
 
03:03:05.070 --> 03:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:10.030 --> 03:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
safe State newshire Town pass
 
03:03:12.990 --> 03:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
any Mr chair I think it's also uh
 
03:03:15.070 --> 03:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that it's a
 
03:03:17.950 --> 03:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
quality of life issue for the citizens
 
03:03:20.510 --> 03:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
and the neighbors uh and the people that
 
03:03:22.870 --> 03:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
are that are on the street above and
 
03:03:25.110 --> 03:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
beyond uh the good Representatives
 
03:03:28.630 --> 03:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
notion of of being
 
03:03:31.830 --> 03:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
um um affected by secondhand smoke it's
 
03:03:33.389 --> 03:03:33.399 align:start position:0%
a quality of life
 
03:03:35.750 --> 03:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
issue and is that the quality of life
 
03:03:39.389 --> 03:03:39.399 align:start position:0%
that we want for the public places in
 
03:03:41.950 --> 03:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so and to
 
03:03:45.070 --> 03:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
avoid that there needs to be some
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
consequential uh violations that deter
 
03:03:51.990 --> 03:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
it otherwise we'll be invoking it and if
 
03:03:54.070 --> 03:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
people learn that there are consequences
 
03:03:57.710 --> 03:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
typically most people will avoid it if
 
03:04:00.710 --> 03:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
the consequence is substantial than us
 
03:04:02.790 --> 03:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
so so we all agree public smoking
 
03:04:06.150 --> 03:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed period the question
 
03:04:08.469 --> 03:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
is is what what the penalty should be
 
03:04:11.910 --> 03:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
all right I guess just this is not Bing
 
03:04:13.510 --> 03:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
but as written is anyone fine with the
 
03:04:16.910 --> 03:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's written right now no okay so we're
 
03:04:20.229 --> 03:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
definitely going to change it um the new
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
do you mind just telling them the new
 
03:04:24.830 --> 03:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
Futures draft they just recommend going
 
03:04:27.710 --> 03:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
from 500 to 100 and I think it's
 
03:04:29.550 --> 03:04:29.560 align:start position:0%
probably to be consistent with the
 
03:04:31.429 --> 03:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
smoking indoor smoking act and is that
 
03:04:34.070 --> 03:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
the that keeps the forfeiture provision
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
yeah who uh supports the no forfeiture I
 
03:04:40.870 --> 03:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
mean the the $100 fine but with the
 
03:04:43.910 --> 03:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
forat well no just just raise your hand
 
03:04:45.990 --> 03:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
if you're you like that I'm not asking
 
03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:46.790 align:start position:0%
if you're you like that I'm not asking
you

03:04:46.790 --> 03:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:04:50.429 --> 03:04:50.439 align:start position:0%
to two uh we'll call it the uh Senator
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:59.110 --> 03:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
version and anyone who didn't is there
 
03:05:01.269 --> 03:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
any um any recommendation for any
 
03:05:03.750 --> 03:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
direction for us to go in I mean this
 
03:05:06.190 --> 03:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
because we have you know the graduated
 
03:05:10.590 --> 03:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
um the chief mayor the graduated
 
03:05:16.469 --> 03:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:18.429 --> 03:05:18.439 align:start position:0%
well so that my recommendation wasn't
 
03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
Class A first right my first the first
 
03:05:23.070 --> 03:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
violation is a B misdemeanor with up to
 
03:05:25.670 --> 03:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
a $500 fine not a mandatory $500 fine
 
03:05:28.469 --> 03:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
just up to the second violation within
 
03:05:32.990 --> 03:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
three years would be um an a misdemeanor
 
03:05:35.269 --> 03:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
with up to a $22,000 fund because you're
 
03:05:37.469 --> 03:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
knowingly now committing a offense that
 
03:05:39.150 --> 03:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
you've been told is not legal and you're
 
03:05:42.110 --> 03:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
doing it anyway so that was my version
 
03:05:44.910 --> 03:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
was uh be misdemeanor and I'd be okay
 
03:05:46.349 --> 03:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
with dropping that to a violation with
 
03:05:48.670 --> 03:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
$500 fine for the first offense so maybe
 
03:05:50.830 --> 03:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
you so first offense would be a
 
03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
violation all right we'll talk about the
 
03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
dollar amount but we'll just no I'm just
 
03:05:56.269 --> 03:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm just brainstorming I'm not
 
03:05:58.590 --> 03:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
saying I agree with
 
03:06:01.950 --> 03:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
it the statute of limitations on
 
03:06:04.429 --> 03:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
violation well okay just can you just
 
03:06:06.070 --> 03:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
continue what you're saying well I it's
 
03:06:08.630 --> 03:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
very odd to get a violation usually but
 
03:06:10.190 --> 03:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
that what's going to happen is is if
 
03:06:11.429 --> 03:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
someone's smoking in public they're
 
03:06:13.389 --> 03:06:13.399 align:start position:0%
going to kind of get the violation right
 
03:06:16.469 --> 03:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
way but if the first one is whether it's
 
03:06:18.710 --> 03:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
500 100 we'll discuss that first one's a
 
03:06:21.550 --> 03:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
violation second offense would that are
 
03:06:25.030 --> 03:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
we okay with that being a b Miss no I we
 
03:06:29.150 --> 03:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
have no here um is the any no we'd have
 
03:06:31.150 --> 03:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
concerns with criminalizing even if for
 
03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
a second offense what about a third
 
03:06:35.670 --> 03:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
offense one option would be the current
 
03:06:37.710 --> 03:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
statute around possession which I think
 
03:06:40.870 --> 03:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
is three times the trip
 
03:06:44.150 --> 03:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
right I mean how many time tickets can
 
03:06:46.030 --> 03:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
you get in one week I think we really
 
03:06:47.309 --> 03:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
see this through the same lens as
 
03:06:49.110 --> 03:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley that I've never seen
 
03:06:50.389 --> 03:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
evidence that that's an effective
 
03:06:51.870 --> 03:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
solution and all you're doing is putting
 
03:06:53.309 --> 03:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
people into the criminal legal system
 
03:06:55.269 --> 03:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
which there's robust data that shows
 
03:06:57.870 --> 03:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's actually harmful to communities um
 
03:06:59.349 --> 03:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
that puts people the criminal record to
 
03:07:00.790 --> 03:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
makes them harder to get employment
 
03:07:03.389 --> 03:07:03.399 align:start position:0%
housing Etc so I don't know why we'd
 
03:07:05.030 --> 03:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
want to I'm just asking how many
 
03:07:07.070 --> 03:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
violations can we make it to what
 
03:07:08.670 --> 03:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
eventually becomes a misdemeanor within
 
03:07:10.469 --> 03:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
like a certain time period you've
 
03:07:12.790 --> 03:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
committed now 10 violations of this it's
 
03:07:15.309 --> 03:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
still be just a violation I'm just
 
03:07:16.750 --> 03:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
trying to say can we put something that
 
03:07:19.630 --> 03:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
kind of satisfies one end in the other I
 
03:07:21.870 --> 03:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
think the middle ground was the was the
 
03:07:25.429 --> 03:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
your graduating scale but if the F's not
 
03:07:28.750 --> 03:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
working clearly would it ever become a
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
Mis could be second offense third
 
03:07:32.429 --> 03:07:32.439 align:start position:0%
offense I think in a three-year look
 
03:07:35.190 --> 03:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
back the third one is by that point I
 
03:07:36.990 --> 03:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
think is more than reasonable is it the
 
03:07:39.229 --> 03:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
case with but what about with
 
03:07:41.429 --> 03:07:41.439 align:start position:0%
smoking we're not putting this the same
 
03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
as a a cigar or cigarette well well
 
03:07:45.870 --> 03:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a deterrent right
 
03:07:47.750 --> 03:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes but I think also the the public
 
03:07:51.750 --> 03:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
health nicotine doesn't lead to
 
03:07:53.950 --> 03:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
psychosis one causes impairment one
 
03:07:56.950 --> 03:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't that's that's I mean I mean I I
 
03:07:59.830 --> 03:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
have multiple work injuries from people
 
03:08:02.670 --> 03:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
being high on the job no I I'm just
 
03:08:04.429 --> 03:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
asking well but smoking causes lung
 
03:08:06.990 --> 03:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
cancer I mean right and so but I think
 
03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
what we I think my question is if the
 
03:08:13.110 --> 03:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
real purpose is deterrence we need to
 
03:08:14.950 --> 03:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
have the data to prove that's it's an
 
03:08:17.910 --> 03:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
effective deterrent to criminalize the
 
03:08:20.750 --> 03:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
behavior misdemeanor what's I got a good
 
03:08:22.070 --> 03:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
idea because this conversation is very
 
03:08:24.389 --> 03:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
helpful I just not agreeing why don't we
 
03:08:26.510 --> 03:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
all kind of we all kind of know what our
 
03:08:29.070 --> 03:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts are and we can flush that out
 
03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
more at the next meeting so we're
 
03:08:31.950 --> 03:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
clearly not going to come to a agreement
 
03:08:33.110 --> 03:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
today and we can
 
03:08:36.110 --> 03:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
all work on that is um when's our next
 
03:08:36.120 --> 03:08:38.830 align:start position:0%
all work on that is um when's our next
meeting

03:08:38.830 --> 03:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
schedule just regarding this it's going
 
03:08:43.950 --> 03:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
to be changed regardless of what's put
 
03:08:46.590 --> 03:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
down no one on the no one raised their
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
hand that they supported
 
03:08:50.269 --> 03:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
ezri that that was the only thing that
 
03:08:53.790 --> 03:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
we were agreement on
 
03:08:56.590 --> 03:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
well Senator abis and and Senator Lang
 
03:08:58.190 --> 03:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
you've served in the house you know
 
03:09:00.870 --> 03:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
there's about 80 to 100 people that will
 
03:09:04.590 --> 03:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
go no just because you know what day of
 
03:09:11.150 --> 03:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:14.190 --> 03:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
it I I can Rel to why they may not be on
 
03:09:16.110 --> 03:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
board with the first offense being a
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I'm just wondering I mean a
 
03:09:20.269 --> 03:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
second or third offense still not
 
03:09:22.510 --> 03:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
graduating that high it's getting to a
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
point where but we'll we'll discuss that
 
03:09:26.870 --> 03:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
more um next meeting is on for the 9th
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
is that am I right with that
 
03:09:33.550 --> 03:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
go CH may I just say one thing if what
 
03:09:36.630 --> 03:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
we want to do is protect our children
 
03:09:39.870 --> 03:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
advertising limit on Advertising is
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
something that we've all agreed to about
 
03:09:45.790 --> 03:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
role modeling and this is a form of
 
03:09:47.550 --> 03:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
advertising when people are standing
 
03:09:50.830 --> 03:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
there smoking weed or vaping weed in
 
03:09:53.429 --> 03:09:53.439 align:start position:0%
public our children will be witness to
 
03:09:56.429 --> 03:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
this do we not want to protect them no
 
03:09:58.030 --> 03:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
it's not about that because I want to
 
03:09:59.910 --> 03:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
protect them too I it is about that I'm
 
03:10:02.110 --> 03:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
a mom and I no I just want to be clear
 
03:10:04.269 --> 03:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
I'm a mom and I want to protect children
 
03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
I don't want people smoking weed or
 
03:10:09.070 --> 03:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
tobacco in my child's face it's
 
03:10:10.990 --> 03:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely not about that I'm just
 
03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
saying what is the most effective way to
 
03:10:15.790 --> 03:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
do to do it we are prohibiting we are
 
03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
prohibiting it that's exactly what we're
 
03:10:20.510 --> 03:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
doing I'm a mom and so I I really reject
 
03:10:21.870 --> 03:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
that notion that I don't want that
 
03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
protection I have a 10-year-old I don't
 
03:10:26.750 --> 03:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
want anyone smoking tobacco in his face
 
03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
either nor do I want cannabis in his
 
03:10:32.830 --> 03:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
face want a strong deterrent correct I I
 
03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
want I want I want as an effective
 
03:10:37.550 --> 03:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
deterrent and but I also don't want to
 
03:10:40.190 --> 03:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
put people in jail and to have criminal
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
records for this because I know that's a
 
03:10:44.269 --> 03:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
harm to to the Greater Community as well
 
03:10:45.910 --> 03:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
but I really reject the notion that I
 
03:10:47.910 --> 03:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to protect my children or
 
03:10:50.110 --> 03:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
others I think that's very very unfair
 
03:10:52.750 --> 03:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
so Dave I'll work with you and we'll see
 
03:10:54.630 --> 03:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
what we can do about I graduated for
 
03:10:56.269 --> 03:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
multiple offense stuff and see what we
 
03:10:57.750 --> 03:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
can come up with for language for this
 
03:10:59.469 --> 03:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
because it's obviously what's here isn't
 
03:11:02.510 --> 03:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
isn't supported by anybody at all and so
 
03:11:03.670 --> 03:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to be there's going to be a
 
03:11:06.469 --> 03:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
change I'll work with um with Dave to
 
03:11:07.710 --> 03:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
see if we can come up with some sort of
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
compromised language that'll that talks
 
03:11:11.910 --> 03:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
about a graduated service I happen to
 
03:11:13.670 --> 03:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
disagree with on this when you have a
 
03:11:15.710 --> 03:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
knowingly offense I think it needs to be
 
03:11:17.950 --> 03:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
a heavier penalty um but we can work on
 
03:11:21.309 --> 03:11:21.319 align:start position:0%
what that do you mind including our our
 
03:11:23.229 --> 03:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley yeah because I I mean I
 
03:11:25.750 --> 03:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
think in the end it is the it is us that
 
03:11:27.190 --> 03:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
are going to vote on it we are the
 
03:11:29.710 --> 03:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
elected officials and so I'm there's
 
03:11:31.990 --> 03:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely no way that I would support
 
03:11:33.710 --> 03:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
any sort of Bill that had a misdemeanor
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:42.590 --> 03:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
so so we we'll do that we'll we'll take
 
03:11:44.469 --> 03:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
that up and I'll see if we can find I'll
 
03:11:45.670 --> 03:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
see what we can come up with I think you
 
03:11:47.309 --> 03:11:47.319 align:start position:0%
and I going to Just Disagree Becky on
 
03:11:49.110 --> 03:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
that and and that's the nature of
 
03:11:51.070 --> 03:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
politics sometimes but I do think there
 
03:11:52.670 --> 03:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be enhanced penalties for a
 
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
second offense because of the knowingly
 
03:11:56.510 --> 03:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
state after or even the fifth offense
 
03:11:58.110 --> 03:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
maybe be enhanced I mean there should be
 
03:12:00.030 --> 03:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
eventually that I think the violation if
 
03:12:01.950 --> 03:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
it proves ineffective with an individual
 
03:12:03.670 --> 03:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
there needs to be something
 
03:12:06.910 --> 03:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
else but why don't we discuss that more
 
03:12:09.309 --> 03:12:09.319 align:start position:0%
at um you know the next meeting and uh
 
03:12:11.510 --> 03:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
so on for the n9th what make sure you
 
03:12:21.750 --> 03:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:24.070 --> 03:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
I have I have a parent teacher
 
03:12:25.910 --> 03:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
conference on the ninth but I will come
 
03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
are
