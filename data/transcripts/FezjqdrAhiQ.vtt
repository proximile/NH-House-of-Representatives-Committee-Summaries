00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
individual thank
 
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
you a couple of quick housekeeping notes
 
00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
here um mostly for the committee to
 
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh to jump on um what I have planned or
 
00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
what we hope to have planned so um
 
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
you've noticed the
 
00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
time uh looks like there's a gap here um
 
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
from the hearings your morning hearings
 
00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 align:start position:0%
I don't think there will be um I think
 
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
well you've seen um so we have uh but
 
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
whatever time we do have available the
 
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
Republicans will be caucusing before
 
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
lunchtime I believe
 
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
um We Have a scheduling issue um with
 
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
our our only early bill um the one that
 
00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 align:start position:0%
is is uh being heard at 1:00
 
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
coincidentally so what I have arranged
 
00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 align:start position:0%
is for um 2 o'clock we're going to have
 
00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
a hard break no matter where we
 
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
are um in in the afternoon bills we'll
 
00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
have a 2 o'clock hard break and we'll be
 
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
exacting um that early
 
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
bill so that will be um
 
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go back we'll recess at 2
 
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
o'clock we'll have the quick 5 10 minute
 
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
executive session and then we'll go
 
00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 align:start position:0%
right back to where we were and keep
 
00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:12.869 align:start position:0%
right back to where we were and keep
going

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.830 align:start position:0%
going
through

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
um beyond that then the next hearing
 
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.830 align:start position:0%
um beyond that then the next hearing
that

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.350 align:start position:0%
that
I

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
um oh the next time we will meet I guess
 
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
will be and I have to put that in by
 
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
noon time um um is it's looking like the
 
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
12th March 12th and we'll exact all our
 
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
remaining bills at that point you want
 
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 align:start position:0%
to do them all in one day well there's
 
00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 align:start position:0%
only um we're running out of time here
 
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
you know um that and every time we start
 
00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
jumping a little bit I don't think it's
 
00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
a problem um I don't it's not even our
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
record I mean we can't even break our
 
00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
record at this point um we had what did
 
00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
we have 18 last last session so it's
 
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
possible to do um but I think um I think
 
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh we have to get a lot of these things
 
00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
done before our um our crossover
 
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
deadline so uh the 12th looks like the
 
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
the next available date it's it's a
 
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um and there's a there is some
 
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
chance that we will be
 
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
um somewhere shortly thereafter going
 
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
into two days of session so it would be
 
00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and Thursday as I
 
00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.070 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and Thursday as I
recall

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
right well not us all but uh yes so I
 
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
think that limits between the day that
 
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
this room is used the possibility of a
 
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
two-day um session week
 
00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
you get squeezed here along the line so
 
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
I think that's what we're planning on
 
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
doing um that being
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
said we
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
have one two this is prime sponsor if
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
you hold just a second while we
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
all right welcome
 
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
um the time being past 9:00 um and on
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
the schedule we have House Bill 142 uh
 
00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
the chair will call the prime sponsor
 
00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
representative and chair Michael Mett
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you Mr chair happy
 
00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
to be here uh we've been here before
 
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
we'll get right to it um for the record
 
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
I am represent Mike Moffett representing
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
marac District 4 the lovely towns of
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
canterberry and Lowden so this
 
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
bipartisan measure as I said has been in
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
this mix before
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh this version includes some some new
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
language some compromises that reflect
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
some earlier testimony and feedback that
 
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
the uh supporters have received so the
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
the flag design is from a National
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
Organization to be sure uh honor and
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
remember Inc um it's a nonprofit 501c
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's been some confusion about that
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
um I also want to say that uh 28 States
 
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
28 other states most states have already
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh supported and and um and uh signed on
 
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh and adopted this flag is something
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
that these other states um officially
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
recognize so
 
00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
uh I understand earlier concerns about
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
the flag uh one of the big issues was
 
00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 align:start position:0%
does this flag detract from the American
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
flag uh of which I'm also a big
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
supporter of the American
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
flag uh yeah yes uh so hopefully the
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
latest wording of this measure will
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
better address those concerns my
 
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
position is obviously one of support for
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh Goldstar families and and other
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
families who seek to have this flag
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
recognized by New Hampshire like most
 
00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
other states have recognized it and some
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
of these folks will testify
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
momentarily um so some of you know I'm a
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a history guy and this type of ini
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
initiative helps keep memories alive and
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
Spirits alive of our of our fallen uh
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
will also shining a light on History um
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
I know the ranking member has a uh his
 
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
his ancestors who were Bennington with
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
General Stark uh my fourth
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
great-grandfather was at Bennington
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
General Stark I had never thought about
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
getting a flag until this year uh just
 
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
didn't occur to me but were I to do that
 
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh my fourth great-grandfather uh that's
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things about this flag is you
 
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
can put a name on it uh American flag
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
you you don't do that uh that's would be
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
seen as flag desecration but one of the
 
00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
purposes of this flag option is to
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
personalize it to family
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
members so and also during a time when
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
military recruiting has been struggling
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
up and down uh this type of recognition
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
since I think we think an important
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
message that military service
 
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
is still valued and that those who make
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
the ultimate sacrifice will be
 
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
remembered so to add a personal not I
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
was kind of pulled into this effort
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
several terms ago along with Senator
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
avard and I was happy to get involved
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
because uh um I I'm a veteran and I
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
support veterans I and I try I chair the
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
veterans committee so anything is
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
Veterans related I want to understand
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
and if I can support this is something I
 
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
can and have
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
supported uh and as just said I
 
00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh I never considered myself
 
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
part of a gold star family um but I was
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
just a couple weeks ago I was walking on
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
a trail in Canterbury one of my two
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
towns and uh I was thinking about
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
putting together some testimony again
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
for this type of measure and uh as I
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
just said it occurs to me that this flag
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
can also honor veterans who weren't
 
00:09:58.829 --> 00:09:58.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily killed in action um some
 
00:09:58.839 --> 00:09:59.870 align:start position:0%
necessarily killed in action um some
veterans

00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
lives their life Journeys are shortened
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
because of physical or or or psychic uh
 
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
trauma that they suffered while on
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
active duty and I thought of my brother
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
John I never thought of this until just
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago uh he was also a
 
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
marine like myself uh we lost him in
 
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
2007 and he left behind a one-year-old
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
and a four-year-old neither of whom have
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
any memory of their father he like I
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
said he's uh buried in bosow and at the
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
Veteran Cemetery and it occurred to me
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
like it never did before that an honor
 
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
and remember flag with his name on it my
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
brother John uh would would be someday
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh a wonderful gift to Christian and
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
Malia and if that flag was officially
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
sanctioned by this body in New Hampshire
 
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
in which we serve then uh it would make
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
that flag much more
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
meaningful to the families and to uh and
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
to veterans
 
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh so a couple other things much has
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
been made in the past and again today
 
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
that some veteran organizations don't
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
endorse the flag um you you'll soon hear
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
from a rep from uh esac which is the
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
state veterans advisory Council and the
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
esvac folks are great folks I know a lot
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
of them a lot of them my friends
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
there's 20 plus members from all over
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
the state representing different
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
veterans organizations last to the
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
January meeting um just to be there to
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
answer questions about pending
 
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
legislation affecting veterans uh
 
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
particularly in the committee I
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
chair uh and this measure was one of
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
several that came up and uh I I was not
 
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
asked to speak about uh this particular
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
measure and I in retrospect I kind of
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
wish I would have thrown my hand up uh
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
but I didn't know if it was my place I
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
was there to answer questions which I
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
did on other bills not not this one
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
but afterwards and now I I kind of wish
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
as a veteran I think they may have
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
allowed me to put my hand up and say a
 
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
few words about the measure they had a
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
brief discussion on it and in the as in
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
the past svac did not support it and
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
what uh the main thrust of the
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
opposition was uh you know we have the
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
American flag we don't need other Flags
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh oh he needs we get buried under the
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
American flag and we don't need other
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
flags to uh to to uh take anything away
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
from the American flag obviously a lot
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
of us don't see it exactly that way so
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
had I been had I been asked to speak or
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
if I just would have thrown my hand up I
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
would have taken a couple minutes to try
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
to share to esvac what I'm sharing with
 
00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
you about the intent of this flag and
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
you you'll hear from other people in
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
just a couple
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
minutes uh the truth of the matter is
 
00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:56.839 align:start position:0%
there are a number of flags and symbols
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
that contribute to our veteran culture
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
I lead the Lowden Memorial Day Parade
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
every Memorial Day and behind me is in
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
the color guard is an American flag and
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
the P flag and American Legion flag the
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
legion has a flag U there are many flags
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned the P flag and all of
 
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
these flags and symbols
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
complement each other as well as they
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
also complement the American flag in my
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
view to to create a a tapestry of of
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
remembrance um a former veteran
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee chair I know the current chair
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
knows him well uh former representative
 
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
from londondary was was a big opponent
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
of recognizing this flag and he echoed
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
the sentiments is doing so somehow
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
detract from the American flag but but
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
guess what uh his flag the Marine Corps
 
00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
flag does fly over the state house every
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
November 10th so his flag flies over the
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
state house but he didn't doesn't want
 
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
and and other folks don't want this flag
 
00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:08.759 align:start position:0%
to get the same type of
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
respect so and I can say that as a
 
00:14:14.189 --> 00:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
marine myself so I I would ask folks
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
like that former chair from londondary
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
um why is it okay to recognize your flag
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
and not this flag
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
seriously um and I also have toine that
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
any Bill's prospects are tied to the
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh I guess perhaps in the past
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
this has been around for a while it's
 
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:33.759 align:start position:0%
gone to veterans committee I guess in
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
the past it's gone to this committee at
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
least twice I'm aware of and uh the the
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
vice worth this to be in veterans
 
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee it's a different culture the
 
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
the vi my vice chair in Veterans State
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
Federal veterans is a a gold star father
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh skip Rollins you all know Skip he
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today uh he obviously
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
uh has supported this in the past and
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
supports it now
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh but it's not in his committee or my
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
committee it's here so it's this
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
committee that now owns this measure and
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
it obviously you know how this all works
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
you can U do what you're going to do
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
with it you can amend it uh you can um
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
do a number of things with or to
 
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
hb42 one of the things that has come up
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to finish up here uh last
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
year's testimony uh somebody pointed out
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't need to
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
be there are five days that were
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
identified as days that it would be nice
 
00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
to have it uh flown whether at the
 
00:15:39.309 --> 00:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
cemetery or in the greater state housee
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
area but it doesn't have to be all five
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
it could be one or two of those days um
 
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
so that's something that you might want
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
to possibly consider if you do if you
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
are open to amending it so anyway uh so
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
the families that have been fighting for
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
this flag have been doing so for many
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
years and uh someday they'll be success
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
uccessful we'll join the other 28 or 30
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
States whatever it is that recognize
 
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
this uh honor remember its
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
flag um so someday they'll be successful
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
but uh but why must they wait for
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
someday why why not today that's my
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
question why can't we now give them the
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
Imp perimeter of our great state to
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
validate their hard work and their flag
 
00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:25.959 align:start position:0%
their memories their lost loved ones uh
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
by passing
 
00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:30.759 align:start position:0%
hb42 uh this year as opposed to some
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
other year so thanks for all your time
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned you think there's
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
about 30 states that already have this
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
do you have listing of those specific
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
Stat or could somebody get one for me
 
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I got a message yesterday on that
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
uh the number I saw yesterday was 28 and
 
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
this it's pending in other states uh it
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
was a list of them Virginia
 
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
uh okay one of the family members does
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
have that information thank
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
questions I have a couple
 
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
um is it uh did I hear you say uh that
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be over the State
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
House it can be in any of the other flag
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
poles that we have thank you for the
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair as to how the If This
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
Were to move forward and the flag would
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
to be G were to gain recognition uh that
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
would be up to the committee as to the
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
days and the sites and the
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
dimensions uh that's all under your uh
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
Power at this time thank you um
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
dimensions are a problem um height of of
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
the uh existing flag poles that we have
 
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
is part of a problem I I'm not I'm not
 
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
certain um how the marine flag flies
 
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
over the state house I'm not sure if
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
can um fly without touching the ground
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh quite frankly I'm not I'm not certain
 
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
um so it's kind of that may be something
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
you want to look into I'm also curious
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
about on line 12 here um
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
this year's version of the bill says U
 
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:05.240 align:start position:0%
shall be displayed daily at the New
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Veteran Cemetery in
 
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:10.039 align:start position:0%
bosin my understanding from last year's
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
testimony is it is flying
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
there than M sh yes the uh the Veteran
 
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
Cemetery has certain protocols and
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
policies where if there's a if there is
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
a funeral they allow families some uh
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
discretion in terms of what they display
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of days that it may be uh
 
00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
actually flown officially uh I'd have to
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
check on with the with the uh the head
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
of uh the Veteran Cemetery on
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
that uh do I
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
understand my understanding is we don't
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
control the the Veteran Cemetery in
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
bosin so how would we be saying shall be
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
displayed daily yeah thank you for that
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
question uh shall versus May again that
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
goes to uh the jargon that we're always
 
00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with here and if the committee
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
wanted if the committee were to say may
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
shall uh that would uh create some some
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
leg some leeway uh in terms of here at
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
the state house uh for whoever is going
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
to uh hoist a flag or or approve certain
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
days for example if this committee were
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
to say uh the committee 5 days course if
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
this moves forward have to go to the
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
Senate uh if the committee supported 5
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
days uh in said May then whoever makes
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
those decisions would have the
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
discretion of uh putting it up all five
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
of those days or one of those days uh if
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
you limited it to one or two days same
 
00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:48.039 align:start position:0%
thing only would be one or two days
 
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
instead of five again committee has a
 
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
whole lot of uh Power here to uh do uh
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
amend or do whatever you do with it and
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
yes the uh the I I mentioned Dimensions
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
earlier and you did as well so I uh I
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
hate to see uh you know procedural
 
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
questions like the dimensions of a flag
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
or how long the flag pole is be a
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
showstopper you know if we can put a man
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
on the moon we can figure out how to uh
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh make the flag dimensions work so that
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
it could be uh displayed on official New
 
00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:24.510 align:start position:0%
it could be uh displayed on official New
Hampshire

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%

Hillsboro 12 for the record I I hold the

he's one of my favorite people I also
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
hold the Goldstar families in the
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
highest esteem um but I do not agree
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
with this bill um I was a freshman in
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
2011 2012 when this bill first came to
 
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
state and federal relations and Veterans
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
Affairs and The Honorable Al balero was
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
chairman at the time the Bill's first
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor was then Senator Lou
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
alesandro one of the people who
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
testified that day was The Honorable
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
Fred rice some of you might remember him
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
he was a Green Beret he fought in
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
Vietnam and you know who shot at him and
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
my brother who also served in Vietnam
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
the Viet Kong and if you look at the
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
Viet Kong flag you'll see that it
 
00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799 align:start position:0%
resembles the honor and remember flag
 
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
and that was a point of contention in in
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
the hearings way back then the bill
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
keeps coming back so I do understand
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
it's a personal flag and they've they're
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
not thinking of Viet Kong when they look
 
00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:47.799 align:start position:0%
at the flag they're thinking of their
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
loved one and uh we we were never
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
against um the families having a
 
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.470 align:start position:0%
against um the families having a
personal

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
flag but um as the honor
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
um representative um Moffett said um
 
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
comparing it to the American flag I I
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
remember um honorable balero saying you
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
know um they do have a flag they do have
 
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
a flag um to represent them and it's the
 
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
American flag it's what's draped over
 
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
their coffins when they come home and
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
that should be the only flag that
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
represents our servicemen and
 
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:30.520 align:start position:0%

represent the state veterans advisory
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
committee um we're actually chartered by
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
state RSA 115 colon a-8 to uh speak for
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
veterans and one of the things that we
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
do is we look through all the bills that
 
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
have veteran impact and we take a
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
position on them then I come and tell
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
you what that position is as
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative mfet has already said uh
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
we do oppose this legislation and for
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
exactly the reason that representative
 
00:24:26.669 --> 00:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
mfet said we feel like we have the
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
American flag and that's really all that
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
we're that we're about we do applaud the
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
work that honor and remember does they
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
do a great job with those goldar
 
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
families personalizing a flag at no
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
expense to the family to try and do that
 
00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
we applaud we applaud their work but we
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
feel strongly that we already have the
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
symbol that we need I don't want to take
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%

yes 115 colon a-8 and the members of
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
this would be members that would be
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
familiar to you like the American Legion
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%

state um beyond beyond the um the point
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we already have the
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
American flag for uh are there other
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%

that have been told to me and I I will
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
try and make a clarifying point it is my
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
understanding that since preco this flag
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
has flown every single day at the state
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
veterans ver Cemetery in bosan that's my
 
00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.310 align:start position:0%
veterans ver Cemetery in bosan that's my

have a change your opinion it doesn't
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
sound like it well if I me perfectly
 
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
honest um I I represent the members and
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
up here and tell you regardless of my my
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
personal feelings on on this I it's it's
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
it's a good symbol I I see the pluses
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
and minuses of it uh on the one hand you
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
know this this legislation to do this is
 
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
coming from out of state it's coming
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
from people out of state to bring the
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
same language to the same thing and and
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
and bringing this in here um you know
 
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get a national presence for
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
this and they've already got 28 States
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
according to representative MAA to to
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
sign off on it we are my my personal
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
opinion on this is that I I I I could go
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
either way but but what I have to do is
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
I have to support our membership on this
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
and they're and they're pretty adamantly
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to it sir H up thank you um
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
thanks for the additional question uh
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
you mentioned it was the will of your
 
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
membership did was there an actual vote
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
and what kind of percentage was for
 
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
which I I I didn't detect any no votes
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
all the votes were in in favor of
 
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
opposing the legislation so if anybody
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
actually did not support the legislation
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
they they either didn't vote or they
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%

2008 he had served in the US Army uh
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
came home from Afghanistan and was
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
wounded and
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um had PTSD and other
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
issues and again took his own life in
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
September of
 
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:09.799 align:start position:0%
2008 the honor and remember flag is very
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
special to me personally my stepson uh
 
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
lived out in Las Vegas at the time of
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
his death uh he did not have a lot of
 
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
friends he and his family moved around a
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
lot my husband um and his first wife
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
were divorced when Derek was very very
 
00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:29.070 align:start position:0%
were divorced when Derek was very very
young

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
young
 
00:29:32.909 --> 00:29:32.919 align:start position:0%
if this is a way for us to keep Derek's
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
memory alive and all of the other
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
soldiers that we have lost throughout
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
the history of the United
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
States I believe that this is something
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
we need to do I am a proud daughter of
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
two army veterans and I in no way think
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
that this replaces the American
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
flag the American American flag that's
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
presented to families when their Soldier
 
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
has died is folded in a beautiful
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
triangle a lot of people display it in
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
their home you never take that flag out
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
again it's never a symbol for us to
 
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that soldier in any way shape
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
or form there are so many people that
 
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
have no idea what a gold star family is
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know people see us wearing t-shirts
 
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
after we've participated in a run and
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
they want to know how they can get that
 
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
t-shirt that's a nice t-shirt I want one
 
00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:36.519 align:start position:0%
of those no you don't want that you know
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
I speak to my colleagues at work and
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
they have no idea what gold star
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
families are if we can present this
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
honor and remember flag and only fly it
 
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
for one day in the state of New
 
00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:51.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on top of our beautiful
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
capital building and educate people I
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
think it's more than worth it thank you
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you I just read what Trish said uh
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
we have nothing but respect for our
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
veterans and uh we have nothing respect
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
for our flag and again this flag is to
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
remember the people the personal
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
connection they have with the families
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
as the goals our family um when I was
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
working on a career I had many people
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
that worked for me that were veterans
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
from the Vietnam War and I was at some
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
of these meetings before and I brought
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
up the issue about people had the issue
 
00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
with the flag looking like the Vietnam
 
00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:29.799 align:start position:0%
flag or a were the same and every one of
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
those people that worked for me that
 
00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
were again that were veterans had
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand what the issue was
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
because they had nothing but respect for
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to do with the flag
 
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
to get it into into the state yes other
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
states have it and I guess we'd like to
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
be part so good same as the other states
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
but we want it for New Hampshire it's
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
going has nothing to do with those that
 
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
have served that are still alive which
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
is fantastic we have a lot of respect
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
for them this is for the families that
 
00:31:59.950 --> 00:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
have lost member to their service to our
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
country and we really believe that
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
that's something that's very important
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
like Trish said you know a lot of people
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
have no idea what a gold St family is
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
they ask how like said don't what do we
 
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
have to do become part of that say it's
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
not a group you really want to be part
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
of um questions have come up on other
 
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
meetings we've been at before and uh we
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
believe we've answered questions that
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
have come up if people have more
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
questions we'd like to know the
 
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
questions so we could address them and
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
take the fear away some people have
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
because I know one of the first meetings
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
that came to the fear was we were trying
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
to replace the American flag that is so
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
off course it's it's ridiculous again
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of respect for the flag
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
a lot of respect for all of our military
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
people who have served like chis said
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
from a military family I had a lot of
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
military in my family and a lot of
 
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
respect for them and we'd like it to be
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
considered so that we get the whole
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
state for the State of New Hampshire to
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
understand what Goldstar family is and
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
how much we missed that soldier that we
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
lost and how much all those soldiers
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
need to be remembered and not forgotten
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's basically why we're here and why
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
we want the flag to be represented from
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire thank you
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.120 align:start position:0%

00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
points absolutely sure um we did have a
 
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
pla a flag presentation at the Jaffrey
 
00:33:22.629 --> 00:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
BFW they were very um accommodating and
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
and we did that a few um a few weeks ago
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
and also wanted to ask if um testimony
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
that was sent to you online if that's
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
something that's been looked at uh yes
 
00:33:36.629 --> 00:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
it it's received in up until midnight
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
tonight so typically I and I don't speak
 
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:40.600 align:start position:0%

00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%

00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%

Greenland and one one of my constituents
Nancy

00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
Nancy
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
Marston um is a Gold Star Family
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
mother and I am sponsoring this bill in
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
honor of her and her family and when one
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
of my constituents wants something just
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
like you I try everything I can to make
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
it happen because I think that we
 
00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:38.839 align:start position:0%
represent the people of New Hampshire
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
and when something like this is
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
requested it should be seriously
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
evaluated I thought a lot about this
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
because we testified before you last
 
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.389 align:start position:0%
because we testified before you last
year

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
and the premise was that the American
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
flag is the flag that should represent
 
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
these these um
 
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
individuals who don't come
 
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.950 align:start position:0%
individuals who don't come
home

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
and I understand
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
that but at the same time the Flag
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
represents all of us the American Flag
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
represents all the people in this room
 
00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
all the people in the state all the
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
people in this
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
country and the honor and remember flag
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
represents those people who fought for
 
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
pre freedom and are not home to enjoy
 
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
it so it's to me an extra it's a blanket
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
it's an extra
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
blanket and um we have a flag for those
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
individuals who are missing in
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
action but once they're
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
found there isn't a flag for them it's
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
and the honorary member flag Inc cases
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
all of those special people
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
so I hope that you'll approach this bill
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
with an open heart and an open
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
mind and support it thank you so much
 
00:36:10.589 --> 00:36:10.599 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you uh will you take
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
questions if there are absolutely
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely do we have
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%

with me it's just us here don't
 
00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
worry um for 12 years New Hampshire
 
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
citizens have requested passage of a
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
bill to adopt the honor and remember
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
flag it occurred to me the other day
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
that maybe we have not been clear on why
 
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
this flag is so
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
important gold star families will tell
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
you that it gives them peace it gives
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
them some healing to their grief to see
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
their CH son or daughter's name on an
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
honor and remember flag that's true I
 
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
fly my flag every Sunday the other six
 
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
days I fly the American
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
flag but the other part of flag is the
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
fact that it represent excuse
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
me this flag specifically is to pay
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
tribute to the thousands of New
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire men and women it's a point of
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
Pride for New Hampshire when citizens
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
see the flag flying they say look we
 
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
have Patriots who wanted to protect us
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
who fought for us and who gave their
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
lives for New Hampshire and the United
 
00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
States this flag will be meaningful to
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
everyone in New
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do you remember there are
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
1,23 New Hampshire citizens who died in
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%

226 New Hampshire citizens who gave
 
00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
Vietnam off hand I have three classmates
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
that I can tell you right now Doug Tom
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
and Peter work classmates of mine in
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
conquered High School this flag will
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
them what about the
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
399 New Hampshire citizens who served in
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
the Korean
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
conflict and did not return home do you
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
them and recently the glob the global
 
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
war on t terrorism has certainly touched
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
everyone in New Hampshire either
 
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
directly or
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
indirectly 96 so far men and women have
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
gave their lives they did not lose their
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
lives they gave their lives for New
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and for their
 
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
country by the way when my son went to
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
war when all military go to war they
 
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
wear the New Hampshire FL the American
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
flag on their
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
uniform we in no way want to replace
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
that aren't you proud of all those New
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens you should be proud
 
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
and I believe it is the right thing to
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
do to show our pride our and to honor
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
all the military lives
 
00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
and to
 
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
remind every school child every adult
 
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
everyone in our state who see this flag
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
that there were people who sacrificed
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
democracy in closing I want to say that
 
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
sorry Goldstar family's
 
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
grief we are the ones who know better
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
than anyone what will help us we know we
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
wish the veterans organizations
 
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
officially would support the flag but
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
frankly Goldstar families know what
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
Goldstar families need better than
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
anyone and Goldstar family
 
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately seem to be the ones who
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
were looking at reminding the rest of
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
the country of the sacrifices that
 
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
made we are only asking for three days a
 
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
year to fly this flag Memorial Day gold
 
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
star Mother's Day and Gold Star Mothers
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:32.559 align:start position:0%
three days a year does not sound like
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.069 --> 00:42:47.079 align:start position:0%
remember I think this is speaking for me
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
I think 12 years is long enough for
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
Goldstar families and others who
 
00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.950 align:start position:0%

understand

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%

rather than going off and talking and
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
having objections that we didn't even
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
know to answer representative payer I
 
00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:13.559 align:start position:0%
was still confused as to why the vet
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
associations are opposed to this do you
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
have any other I'm glad you asked that
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
there are actually veterans several
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
veterans who sit on the National Honor
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
and remember board nationally they do
 
00:44:31.549 --> 00:44:31.559 align:start position:0%
sit on the board um as Trish told you
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
there are veterans organizations who are
 
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
supportive who have received Flags who
 
00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
this and obviously 28 other states
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
supportive wait yeah um please accept my
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
condolences as well um sorry I'm a first
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
ter rep so I'm missing a little bit of
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
the context for um the past 12 years
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
that this effort has been ongoing um so
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering if you had uh just
 
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
a bit of an overview of how this started
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
or um the reason why this has not passed
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
if if you happen
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
topec basically um this is a movement
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
that as was referred to earlier um is
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
has become a national movement um a
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
goldar dad founded the honor and
 
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.990 align:start position:0%
goldar dad founded the honor and
remember

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.950 align:start position:0%
remember
organization

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
and and developed the flag as a way to
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
honor his son and then he decided to
 
00:45:40.549 --> 00:45:40.559 align:start position:0%
share that
 
00:45:40.559 --> 00:45:42.109 align:start position:0%
share that
Vision

00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
Vision
 
00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
so people in New Hampshire 12 years ago
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
learned about this and
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
um Us in New Hampshire Goldstar families
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire have been given
 
00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
personalized flags three of us here have
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
those flags that we can't show you
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
because they're props but um but we have
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
them and mine has my son's name on it
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
but to be clear what we're asking is not
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
for a flag that would have any
 
00:46:10.549 --> 00:46:10.559 align:start position:0%
individual name on it as I said there's
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
that but then there's the representing
 
00:46:16.549 --> 00:46:16.559 align:start position:0%
everyone so the flag that would fly in
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
the flag that flies every day at the
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
Veteran Cemetery represents everyone
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
there's no no name on that flag so
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
anyway so there's been some as you may
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
have heard there's been
 
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.670 align:start position:0%
have heard there's been
some

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
issues that we want to replace the
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
America you know it's things that we've
 
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
addressed it's been it's been tough
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
because many of the issues are so far
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
reality and as I said gold star families
 
00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
know more than anyone what Goldstar
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
families and what the Fallen
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
deserve that's pretty brief but I don't
 
00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:52.559 align:start position:0%
want to go into every single I
 
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:54.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you very much
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh part of that is
 
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
um our fault um we tend
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
to we've we've heard the bill several
 
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
times so um it has a tendency and and if
 
00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
times so um it has a tendency and and if
I

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
family so you know the boys had quite
 
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
a difficult time because they they were
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
expected to salute
 
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
her um I I'm here in favor of this flag
 
00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
and I hold it to my
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
heart and and the reason it is important
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
as a gold star mother it's because it
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
represents my son's
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
life not just his
 
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.150 align:start position:0%
life not just his
death

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
death
 
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.670 align:start position:0%
death
Russell

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
Russell
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
was very
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
much a character
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
and lived up to his commitment he made a
 
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
commitment to his country to all of
 
00:49:58.109 --> 00:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
you and he kept that
 
00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:00.799 align:start position:0%
commitment there were other promises
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
made he he would join um he was actually
 
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
um petitioning to be in the State Police
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
when he was when he would complete
 
00:50:19.319 --> 00:50:22.630 align:start position:0%
when he was when he would complete
his

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
tour I didn't know until after he
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
passed that he made contributions every
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
month out of his measly pay to an
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
organization that takes care of children
 
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.069 align:start position:0%
organization that takes care of children
with

00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
cancer I was proud of
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
that and I have
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
continued to make that donation in his
 
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
name there were other things that he had
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
do so we didn't just lose a hero on the
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
battlefield we lost someone who was
 
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
going to make contributions throughout
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
his life and if you talk to gstar
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
families you will hear that same
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
theme their sons their
 
00:51:28.589 --> 00:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.599 --> 00:51:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
continue to make
 
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
improvements the reason this flag is
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
important to me is because it's not
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
static it's alive it
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
moves I can take it with
 
00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
me I don't in any way dishonor the
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
American flag and you can probably see
 
00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.630 align:start position:0%
American flag and you can probably see
that

00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
um I wear that flag every
 
00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
day as
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
well but the reason that I would like to
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
continue to have the honor and remember
 
00:52:12.559 --> 00:52:13.710 align:start position:0%
continue to have the honor and remember
flag

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
flag
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
flown is because it
 
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
represents the
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
life not
 
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
only the death of my
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
son and all our sons
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
and daughters who have made the ultimate
 
00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
sacrifice uh I didn't write anything out
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
so excuse me for not
 
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:39.799 align:start position:0%
being very articulate but if I had
 
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
written I would not have been able to
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
read it because I tear up and if Russell
 
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.109 align:start position:0%
read it because I tear up and if Russell
were

00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:52:50.109 --> 00:52:50.119 align:start position:0%
here he would say don't pay any
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
did a great job uh would you take any
 
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
questions if we have any I I would be
 
00:53:06.789 --> 00:53:06.799 align:start position:0%
happy to yes questions from the
 
00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
much for coming today and thank you
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
all I have one last pink card uh for
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
Timothy Chron is that right how do I do
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
close enough um ask for two minutes and
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
opposes the bill
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you thank you for taking
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
my testimony um first I want to express
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
what I think everyone here feels is the
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
um complete support and respect for all
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
the gstar families um and I think
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
probably in EXA session any new reps
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
will hear all the arguments from
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
previous years so I won't go into all of
 
00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
those um but just for some of the
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
history um in 2012 I think was the first
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
year that this bill was introduced and
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
um in every year um except 2024 it was
 
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
introduced to the state um and federal
 
00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
relations and Veterans Affairs Committee
 
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
in 2024 it went to Alle then um in
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
2012 uh this committee or the state fed
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
committee voted 11 to1 to remove the
 
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
language referring to the honor member
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
flag from the bill um and so it voted 11
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
to1 against this
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
idea um in
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
2013 the committee voted nine to one
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
against this this essentially the same
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
bill the bill has never in any
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
significant I would say um any
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
significant respect change from the
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
original in
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
2014 uh there were several different uh
 
00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
bills but
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
this committee uh state and federal
 
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:03.559 align:start position:0%
voted 13-2 and again this is democratic
 
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
um houses and chairs and Republican
 
00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
houses and chairs and a strong Byars
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
majority each time voted 13-2 against
 
00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:14.470 align:start position:0%
majority each time voted 13-2 against
this

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
bill on the Senate bill that went
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
through the Senate um this Comm or the
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
state and federal voted 13 to nothing
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
against this
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
bill and all the these bills all the
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations were adopted um on a
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
Voice vote or presumably on the content
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
calendar by the full
 
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
house um in
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
2018 uh there was about 14 to nothing to
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
itl in
 
00:55:44.079 --> 00:55:48.109 align:start position:0%
itl in
2018

00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.119 --> 00:55:49.710 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh and uh yes and in 2020 uh the bill
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
was tabled and died on the table and
 
00:55:59.069 --> 00:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
rather strange pandemic here we will be
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
going through all of this um in a in a
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
written form just if it helps you at all
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
and uh finally uh this I believe that is
 
00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:16.039 align:start position:0%
all until last year um when uh
 
00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:19.799 align:start position:0%
it when it was killed 16 to nothing in
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
committee um so
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
there's there have been patriotic people
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
on this committee and in the state and
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
federal Relations Committee for well
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
over a decade looking at and examining
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and um I'd hesitate before
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the vast majority of
 
00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
them were mistaken and again I just want
 
00:56:43.789 --> 00:56:43.799 align:start position:0%
to stress my absolute respect for those
 
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
who um the citizens who supported this
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
bill and have find deep meaning in this
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
flag and uh and I I'm glad that they do
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
and it's perfectly appropriate that they
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
do I just don't believe that the state
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
should be um supporting the private flag
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe it's makes any sense
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
to compare this flag to this flag of the
 
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
United States Marine
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
Corps and think that's all I'll take
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any great thank
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
you very much uh representative Le yeah
 
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I guess I can see
 
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:20.839 align:start position:0%
that there's this pattern that you're
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
describing um and I've heard a couple of
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
the arguments regarding veterans
 
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.710 align:start position:0%
the arguments regarding veterans
and

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
associations thinking that this in in
 
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.230 align:start position:0%
associations thinking that this in in
some

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
fashion replaces the American flag um is
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
there is that the main argument that you
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
would say is that your position as to
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
why you oppose it well there are there
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
are many essentially it's um asking for
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
the state government the people of State
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and the government of
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire to endorse
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
what is a nonprofit but still a private
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
flag um a private organization flag we
 
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
don't um and to require that it be flown
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
at uh government the veteran cetar at
 
00:58:17.549 --> 00:58:17.559 align:start position:0%
government um institutions that is one
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
thing that seems inappropriate to me
 
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
they are able to and they uh the veteran
 
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
secretary voluntarily does but to it
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
seems inappropriate to me to require or
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
to Grant a state Monopoly essentially or
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
um State impr premature on a
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
private not for-profit
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
symbol good thank you representa s thank
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I'm not sure if you would
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
know this question but do you happen to
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
know how many different flags get flown
 
00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:58.839 align:start position:0%
at the State House throughout the year I
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
do not um and I'm not sure how many of
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
them if any besides the US flag the New
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire flag and the pmia flag I'm not
 
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
sure if any are mandated to be flowing
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
possibly the Marine Corps flag which is
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
as you may know the Marine Corps is part
 
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
government thank you uh seeing no
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you very much
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
for your
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
help seeing no more pink cards uh I'll
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on uh House Bill

01:00:42.400 --> 01:01:18.190 align:start position:0%
 
after

01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh we're back uh time being after our uh
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
schedule time for House Bill 157

I'll open the hearing um and welcome the
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor um representative

Muntz welcome to legislative
 
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
um members of the committee for the
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
just for the record my name is Chris
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
muns I am one of uh the four state
 
01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
representatives from Rockingham District
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
29 representing the town of Hampton
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce HB 157 a bill
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
establishing a study committee to
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
examine ways to improve the usefulness
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
of fiscal
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
notes now if you're like me you probably
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
shake your head and roll your eyes
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
whenever you see a bill recommending the
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
formation of a of another study
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
committee and you secretly hope that you
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
will not be appointed to it when I first
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
began to consider this issue
 
01:02:24.029 --> 01:02:24.039 align:start position:0%
establishing a study committee was not
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
what I envisioned but after talking with
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
other members and our friends in the
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistance office I
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
do believe this is one instance when a
 
01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:35.559 align:start position:0%
study committee is warranted and
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
necessary as members of the general
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
court we have a constitutional duty to
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
consider and enact laws and I quote from
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
part two Article Five of our state
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
constitution as they may judge for the
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
benefits and Welfare of this state end
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
quote to assist us with that
 
01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility C certain bills we
 
01:02:59.069 --> 01:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
consider are accompanied by a fiscal
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
note again I don't know about you but I
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
have found most fiscal notes to be of
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
little use in understanding what
 
01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:10.839 align:start position:0%
benefits and Welfare to the state those
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation to which they are
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
affixed are likely to have typically
 
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
most of them only include a statement of
 
01:03:21.069 --> 01:03:21.079 align:start position:0%
the impact on the budget of an affected
 
01:03:21.079 --> 01:03:22.190 align:start position:0%
the impact on the budget of an affected
state

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
agency one example of why this is not
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
enough is the replacement of the Canon
 
01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:28.710 align:start position:0%
enough is the replacement of the Canon
Mountain

01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
Mountain
 
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
Tramway the cost of the state to do so
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
will be approximately 20 to $25
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
million if that is all that is included
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note of the bill to fund
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
it some of us might be inclined to vote
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
against it as something that the state
 
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
cannot afford not right now with some of
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
the other budget challenges we
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
face but that would neglect to take into
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
consideration the fact that the
 
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
Franconia Notch State Park where the
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
Tramway is located
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
is the leading generator of revenues for
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
the state park system not to mention one
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
of the greatest tourist attractions in
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
our state and an economic development
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
engine for the northern part of our
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
state without the Tramway State Park
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals and roll toll revenues
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
would decline blowing a hole in our
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
state budget but probably even more
 
01:04:22.829 --> 01:04:22.839 align:start position:0%
devastating would be the fact that some
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
local businesses would likely close
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
impacting employment in the region and
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
local property tax revenues the overall
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
long-term negative impact of not
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
replacing the traway would likely dwarf
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
the one-time cost to do
 
01:04:41.549 --> 01:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately that kind of full cost
 
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis is not something we
 
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
usually if ever see when I asked lb LBA
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
why I discovered the
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
following RSA 1444 limits the scope of a
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes to those bills and res
 
01:04:59.230 --> 01:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
resolutions having an impact on the
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
revenues expenditures or fiscal
 
01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
liability of the state city town or
 
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
County we have limited their ability to
 
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
um to to delve into more um detail RSA
 
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
1446 Roman numeral 3 requires fiscal
 
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
notes to include quote various
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
calculations but does not include any
 
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
requirement to identify and quantify the
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
economic benefits that might ACR to the
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
the city state town or count County if
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation is
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
implemented although RSA 1431 B Roman
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
numeral 1 uh B assigns responsibility
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
for preparing fiscal notes to the LBA in
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
most cases they rely on the affected
 
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
state agencies to do the actual analysis
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
and while RSA 1446 Roman numeral 1 gives
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
LBA the ability to request assistance
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
from any source of data they deem
 
01:05:55.039 --> 01:05:56.390 align:start position:0%
from any source of data they deem
reliable

01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
reliable
 
01:05:58.349 --> 01:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to private
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
individuals corporations and
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
associations located within or outside
 
01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
the state they have limited resources to
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
tap into that
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
expertise another major in hindrance
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
quite frankly is the fact that there are
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
almost 2,000 bills introduced during a
 
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
typical 2-year legislative session since
 
01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
the current requirement in statute is
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
that any bill with a possible fiscal
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
impact of $110,000 or more must have
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that means by law a fiscal
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
note must be prepared for over one half
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
of those bills that volume of work plus
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
the deadlines the house and the Senate
 
01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
set for ourselves means that the LBA is
 
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
lucky to produce anything let alone
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
something that provides a comprehensive
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
analysis while I had hoped to craft a
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
bill that would establish new
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
requirements for fiscal notes going
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
forward I realized that with so many
 
01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
moving pieces
 
01:06:59.269 --> 01:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
it would be impossible for me or anyone
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
single individual to do so in any
 
01:07:01.079 --> 01:07:02.150 align:start position:0%
single individual to do so in any
meaningful

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
01:07:05.069 --> 01:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
way this seemed like one instance where
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
it made sense for a committee of
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
legislators to get together to decide
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
what we believe we need to help us carry
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
out the Constitutional duties assigned
 
01:07:14.039 --> 01:07:14.750 align:start position:0%
out the Constitutional duties assigned
to

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
us the duties of the study committee
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
would include at least the
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
following review and recommend changes
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
to requirements in current statute for
 
01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
when or where a fisc note is
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
required current guidelines for
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
preparing fiscal notes developed by the
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
LBA and distributed to the affected
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
state agencies and current House and
 
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
Senate rules to determine if changes in
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
the filing period for lsrs could or
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
should be modified in order to provide
 
01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:45.799 align:start position:0%
more time to complete required fiscal
 
01:07:48.269 --> 01:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
notes the committee would also determine
 
01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
whether the current requirement that a
 
01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is required if the estimated
 
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact is $10,000 or more should
 
01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.150 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact is $10,000 or more should
be

01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
increased and finally the committee
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
would evaluate whether the current
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
Staffing and budget of the LBA is
 
01:08:04.589 --> 01:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
sufficient to process the number of
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes the office is required to
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
provide and also that the state agencies
 
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
have the Staffing and resources they
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
need to provide the LBA with the
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
detailed analysis and input it requires
 
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
for fiscal notes it is required to
 
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
complete the committee would consist of
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
five members of the house and three
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
to give the members ample time to
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
investigate and discuss the options I'm
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the committee have until
 
01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
September 1st of 2026 next year to
 
01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
complete its work I hope you will
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill is ought to pass and
 
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
to remove any fear you may have of being
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
appointed to committee I will gladly
 
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
agree to serve on it uh thank you for
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
your time and I'd be happy to uh answer
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have I was
 
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
going to suggest I think you just named
 
01:08:59.149 --> 01:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
yourself to that committee but that's uh
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
any uh questions for the represent
 
01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:02.430 align:start position:0%
any uh questions for the represent
representative

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
way yeah thank you Mr chair um and thank
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
you for coming to testify so um I guess
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
my question is it you sort of addressed
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
it at then in that last portion of your
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
testimony but um to reiterate given that
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
OS is already pretty overwhelmed um or
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
sorry the LBA LBA my bad um
 
01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:26.910 align:start position:0%
sorry the LBA LBA my bad um
is

01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
already uh struggling to provide
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
detailed fiscal notes and I do agree
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
that it would be very beneficial to have
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
that additional Revenue information
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
um and yeah I guess you're proposing
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
that the committee itself would uh see
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
if if we can increase Staffing um and
 
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
other things I I would imagine there are
 
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
some things that can be done without
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
additional staff um I'm just wondering
 
01:09:58.990 --> 01:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
if this itself needs a yeah no I I what
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
I what I tried to do was was um give the
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
study committee the broadest possible uh
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
range of options that they could look at
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
and and and one of the things I said is
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
that the duties of the committee will
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
include at least the following the I
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
think it's important that the committee
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
have the ability to look at everything I
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
think you know in in essence I think
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
what needs to happen is that we as
 
01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
legislators need to decide what is it
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
that we feel that we need need in order
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
to do our job and then we need to figure
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
out what resources are required to do
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
that um right now we've got a standard I
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
think that suggests that you know fiscal
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
notes must be delivered on a thousand
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
bills but we haven't given the people
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
that are supposed to do that for us the
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
resources and quite frankly the time to
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
be able to do it so something's got to
 
01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.910 align:start position:0%
be able to do it so something's got to
give

01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
give
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere thank you representative wall
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman thank
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
you representative for coming in today
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
and informing us about all this and I
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
share your frustrations um having been
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
here for a while I do know that for
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
example um when I was on the Judiciary
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
Committee we had a very difficult time
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
ever getting fiscal notes um but they
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
were coming through the court system and
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
that was a real problem I wonder have
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
you talked with people in the LBA to
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
find out what their real needs are and
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
how they might sense uh have a sense of
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
ction um I did um that's where I started
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
quite frankly um and as I mentioned in
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
my testimony I uh I started with grand
 
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
visions of you know well this is what we
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
need to do you know we need to we need
 
01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
to you know you you and I you know went
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
to the LBA you need to do be doing this
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
this this and this um and that's when um
 
01:11:50.669 --> 01:11:50.679 align:start position:0%
I got an education um and um you know
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
they had they they enlightened me in
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges that they face um
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
um they they they helped me in drafting
 
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
the bill I mean they I know that they
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
can't take a position on the bill uh but
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
they did help me to make sure that I
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't saying something that uh would be
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know completely outlandish um but um
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
no I did I did consult with him follow
 
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
up thank you very much yes quick follow
 
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
up um we do have a problem getting
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
Senators to attend these study
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
committees have you considered that
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's why I only picked three okay
 
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's ambitious um
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
I have one question and then we'll let
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
you go um is there is it your belief
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
that none of the benefit side of the
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
equation um comes through in testimony
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
from the prime sponsor um when they
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
introduce a
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
bill I think when when we hear testimony
 
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
we get uh we usually get a lot of um
 
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
what I would call you know qualitative
 
01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.870 align:start position:0%
what I would call you know qualitative
anecdotal

01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
anecdotal
 
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
benefits um we rarely get the real
 
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
quantitative side of things to
 
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
um um you know to and and and
 
01:13:14.669 --> 01:13:14.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately what happens is on in the
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note the fiscal note tends to
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
always talk about the
 
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
cost um you know in very specific terms
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh but we rarely get in the fiscal node
 
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
the offsetting financial benefit um and
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
um I think without that
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
information there is a tendency to look
 
01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
at everything as a cost instead of an
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
investment that we're making um and um
 
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
so so yeah that's that's missing I I I
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
think it's that quantitative side of
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
things that U that that's miss that an
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
object and then the other thing also not
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
um not to um impune the motives of
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
people testifying but um you know the
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
value of having somebody like the LBA do
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
it is that hopefully it's objective and
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
not not not not
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
subjective thank you seeing no further
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
questions uh thanks very much for your
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you uh chair will
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
call um our Clerk of the house Paul
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
Smith obviously not taking a position um
 
01:14:29.229 --> 01:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
but for informational purposes only I
 
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
assume yes sir thank you Mr chairman for
 
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
the record Paul Smith Clerk of the house
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
um let me just start by saying that uh
 
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
um I I I certainly don't dispute
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
anything that the uh Prime sponsor uh
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
discussed with you however there's some
 
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
issues that I think that um if you are
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
going to consider this this passage of
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
legislation I I think this needs some
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
work this needs some amending and I'll
 
01:14:54.629 --> 01:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
and I'll be specific as to why um first
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
off and the the construction of the
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
statute uh this is this by the way is a
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
committee a statutory committee bill um
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
versus a commission or or that's thing
 
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
so this is a chaptered study committee
 
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
now uh and in the drafting of this I
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
note that uh coincidentally this is
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
drafted in a way that uh is is very um
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh it it's very different and outside
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
the norm meaning that one member um uh
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
appointed by the chair that two members
 
01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
are appointed by the chair of standing
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
committees that doesn't happen we don't
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
do that um when it's turn when it's time
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
for studies the Speaker of the House
 
01:15:39.629 --> 01:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
historically appoints now in terms of of
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
regarding party membership um that that
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
has always been a practice of the house
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
so uh St you know just in the construct
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
of this language I'm concerned about the
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
chairs of these committees having that
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
appointing authority because that is
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
that is not Norm operating procedure for
 
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
our body um that being said uh because
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
this is a study and because this impacts
 
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
the LBA so
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
significantly um I would recommend that
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistant be
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
assigned to this committee um you know
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
to to to to mandate without actual
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
expertise from that office being part a
 
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
part of that discussion at the table I
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
think is is is not quite the the product
 
01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
that you might be looking
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
for um I want to address a couple of
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
things and and and and my friend from
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
Hampton is is a member of the Commerce
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
Committee and I I bring that up because
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
last year the Commerce Committee uh
 
01:16:42.629 --> 01:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
engaged in a cost benefit analysis
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
regarding ambulance services with the
 
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance now the problem
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
with a cost benefit analysis is you have
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
to engage an outside resource to do that
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it took them eight months to do that
 
01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
so in order to have a a fiscal note that
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
reflects a cost benefit analysis um
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking extremely uh
 
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
extremely prohibitive times on getting
 
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
that information for a fiscal note uh so
 
01:17:09.149 --> 01:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
that's something to consider in in the
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
construct of how a fiscal note is
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
developed um if and having had to write
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes in the past I will tell you
 
01:17:18.669 --> 01:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
exactly what what the process is we
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
receive a worksheet from the legislative
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
budget assistant we ask specifically the
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
amount of money that we are uh needing
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
to spend uh for that program or printing
 
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever the the case may be and then
 
01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
in in terms of the agencies what their
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
projected revenue from that might be so
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes do contain beyond what an
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
expenditure might be what the projected
 
01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
revenue from an increase in taxes is and
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
and I would guide you to look at any of
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
the bills and ways and means that are
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
looking to increase taxes and what the
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
projected Revenue would be from that so
 
01:17:59.550 --> 01:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
you do get those projections there um
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
the the other thing that that I'm I'm
 
01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
the most concerned about uh is the
 
01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
timing uh in terms of changing deadlines
 
01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
uh in the second year of the session our
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
filing period is in September so there
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
is plenty of time for agencies to get
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
their work uh you know done and sent
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature the first year
 
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
is always the problematic year but there
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
are some external and internal factors
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
that we are constrained by the
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the State of New
 
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire says that we're done June 30
 
01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
full stop so every year the Senate Clerk
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
and I work with our rules committees and
 
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
we build calendars backwards from that
 
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
and we are stuck with a certain amount
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
of weeks because you have to get bills
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
over to the other body and vice versa
 
01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
and we are we are constrained by those
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional deadlines
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
um in the in the in the going into the
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
second year uh excuse me the end of the
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
bium so filing for the first year of of
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the next bium we give our our
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
existing members who are running for
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
reelection an opportunity to file
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
legislation before the election and uh
 
01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
pursuant to statute and rule we give our
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
incoming members an additional time uh
 
01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
after the election to file legislation
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
as well but yes there is a deadline and
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
and but we are constrained by those
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
those weeks and months built out that
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
are in the Constitution so it's
 
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
important to keep that in consideration
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
um when you're when you're talking about
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh making recommendations to rules and
 
01:19:44.189 --> 01:19:44.199 align:start position:0%
deadlines uh from a from a a study
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
committee um that sure that sounds great
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
on paper but the reality is we do have
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh we we do have sort of hard deadlines
 
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:55.719 align:start position:0%
that we have to and if you look back at
 
01:19:58.510 --> 01:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
every bium um since we have gone to
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
annual sessions in in 1984 uh you'll see
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
that our deadlines and and
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative wall who's been here most
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
of that time uh will tell you that the
 
01:20:13.229 --> 01:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
deadlines are generally about the same
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh give or take a week or two every
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
single bium um now if you want to amend
 
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and go to a full-time
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
legislature like some states I have no
 
01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
problem with that we could most likely
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
get some of those uh cvas on on on these
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes but I I I only bring these
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
things up in terms of uh your
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
consideration as as to how you uh look
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
at the construct of this committee and
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
what their charges might
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
be you questions representative
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
way um so I understand that doing that
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
more detailed fiscal analysis on a
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
thousand bills is obviously not
 
01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.350 align:start position:0%
thousand bills is obviously not
necessarily

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:20:59.310 --> 01:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
um practical um however there might be
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
some bills that have a very large
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
Financial impact but might benefit from
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
a more detailed fiscal note do you think
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
that this could be structured in a way
 
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
where um a much smaller number of bills
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
would get that um more detailed
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
treatment or is it more just it would
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
take months even for a single Bill to
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
get that detailed analysis um I I I
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
bring up the issue that was in Commerce
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
last year because that was a oneoff uh
 
01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
one-off item and that CBA they it took
 
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
them eight months to get it done because
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
they had to contract out uh to get that
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
analysis done um and that's why I
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
brought up that particular issue uh so
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
that is a one-off issue and and it was a
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
substantive you know analysis um but I I
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
will say uh that we do have many fiscal
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
notes that are developed now uh that are
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
multiple Pages um that that that do have
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
a detailed analysis and sometimes uh as
 
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
as you may or may not know um every bit
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
of the and this is another another
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
interesting thing for your consideration
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
as well but
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
um agencies get the drafts of the bill
 
01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:15.639 align:start position:0%
when OS sends it to
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
them if a member requests a completely
 
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
new redraft during the redraft time um
 
01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.070 align:start position:0%
new redraft during the redraft time um
the

01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
Department of uh Environmental Services
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
might have submitted a 10-page fiscal
 
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
note um but the bill has been
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
substantively changed now uh in in the
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
LSR stage and they might have to do a
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
complete new one so that is that is a a
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
realistic hindrance uh to them uh
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
potentially trying to knock things off
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
in a more uh Speedy rate so to speak um
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
but uh to your to your specific um I I
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
do think we have the capability now we
 
01:22:59.470 --> 01:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
the the state agencies uh L LBA does a
 
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
fantastic job in partner partnering with
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
our state agencies and and getting these
 
01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
done quickly and effectively um there
 
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
does come a time uh and and uh a little
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
bit behind the scenes uh work here but
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
there does come a time every year um
 
01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
when uh it's usually in the first year
 
01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
because again we're we're that's really
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
when we have a more truncated time
 
01:23:22.510 --> 01:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
between the filing and and getting all
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes where we might be
 
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
waiting and and we send a bill to print
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
with what we call a generic fiscal note
 
01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh which has the um the the agency is
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
still working on this note and we'll
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
send it to the clerk's office etc etc um
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
and those those do trickle in uh when
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
they come uh and of course the other
 
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:43.719 align:start position:0%
aspect of this and and we changed our
 
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
policy um within well it's been a while
 
01:23:48.669 --> 01:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
now but since I've been clerk where um
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
anytime we amend a bill um we the the
 
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
LBA instantly sends us a new fiscal note
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
that says this amendment uh will affect
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
this in the following way um but they
 
01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.669 align:start position:0%
this in the following way um but they
won't

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
won't
 
01:24:05.229 --> 01:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
actually a draft a new fiscal note until
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
an amendment is adopted by the body
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
because that is the position of the body
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
um so they are working in concert with
 
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
us in in in the clerk's office in OS Etc
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
to get uh information as quickly and
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
timely as possible for you sorry for the
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um obviously it's
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
gonna be different every year but do you
 
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
happen to know the percentage of bills
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
that require a fiscal note um I I was I
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
I was a little uh surprised when I saw a
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
thousand uh needing a fiscal fiscal note
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
um a year I I I'm not quite sure it's
 
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's that high but but again
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
anything um and a lot of times you'll
 
01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
see fiscal notes that say this this has
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
been uh judged by LBA to cost less than
 
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
10,000 a year now in that instance um
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
they still have to draft it it's so it
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
still takes time to uh for them to
 
01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
analyze it uh from OS and they submit
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
that note back and attach it that means
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
though that the fiscal note stays with
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
the bill so any anytime you see a bill
 
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
like HB 157 it has that FN that that's
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
going to exist through the life of the
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
bill um but that doesn't mean there's
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
actually a real expense to it um so and
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times as well uh you all
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
might make a policy decision to continue
 
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
a program and and amend out the actual
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
funding of it and change it to a dollar
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh appropriation um even though that
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't really cost anything in the
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
grand scheme of things it's still a
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that um so some of those are
 
01:25:39.870 --> 01:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
easier to generate and more uh and
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
quicker to generate then uh some of the
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
more detailed things but but again in
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
some of those more detailed things and
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
and those specific ones for taxes and
 
01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
and revenues and fees um uh uh those you
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
know again are are
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
our fantastic LBA staff um does partner
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
with you know Revenue Administration Etc
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
and and and those affected agencies to
 
01:26:06.270 --> 01:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
to get those uh those hard numbers and
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
and really they do try to project what
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
those revenues will bring in um you know
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
again I I mentioned uh Ways and Means uh
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
there have been several bills uh offered
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
this this uh spring so far that that uh
 
01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
sorry winter it's still winter um uh
 
01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
that that really do have a lot of those
 
01:26:27.629 --> 01:26:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.149 --> 01:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
so no further questions thank you very
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
much CH will'll call NCH
 
01:26:36.109 --> 01:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
Grace from
 
01:26:39.109 --> 01:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
Bia in support of the Bill thank you Mr
 
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
chair n Grace for the business industry
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
Association we are the Statewide Chamber
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
of Commerce uh we do support this
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
legislation and that may seem unusual to
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
some of you um but our me we have over
 
01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
400 members employing over 100,000
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
people across the CATE of New Hampshire
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
and representing about $5 billion in
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
annual revenues uh and one of the things
 
01:27:03.629 --> 01:27:03.639 align:start position:0%
that caught our attention was the study
 
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
committee's charge to look at the
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
broader economic impacts of the
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
possibility of including the broader
 
01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:13.639 align:start position:0%
economic impacts in fiscal notes um
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's something we'd be very interested
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
in as you might imagine our members uh
 
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
would very much like to know where the
 
01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
economy is headed uh and that's
 
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
something we are very interested in as
 
01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
well and policy uh determines that to a
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
large extent so to the extent it is
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
possible to include that if you go
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
forward with a uh study committee um we
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to come to that
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
study committee I'm more than happy to
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
help with that um but that's our
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
specific interest in this
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you uh
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
much I have no additional P up um yep if
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
you'd like to follow up representative
 
01:27:58.510 --> 01:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
sh couple quick follows um thank thank
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I I certainly don't
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
want to take issue with anything that
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
the that the clerk said uh at all and
 
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I know um but I do think that um
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
some of the issues he raised is exactly
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
why I think there needs to be a
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
discussion uh of you know what we want
 
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
going forward so that would be the only
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
point that I would make and then the
 
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
other thing is with regard to how the
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee would be
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
appointed um my only intention there was
 
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure that um there was some
 
01:28:32.109 --> 01:28:32.119 align:start position:0%
bipartisan representation on the study
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee and if there's other ways to
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
do that and not have you know committee
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
chairman appoint them that's and fine
 
01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
and and then the other thing was try to
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
have representation from committees that
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
you know are maybe a little bit more um
 
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
involved with the financial side of
 
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
things so that was where that's coming
 
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
from and I certainly wouldn't have any
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
objection to changing that
 
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you not a problem thank you
 
01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.590 align:start position:0%
great thank you not a problem thank you
very

01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
much just want to make sure um no one
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
else in the room would like to have
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
chime in on any of this no great uh then
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
I will close the hearing on
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
3:31

01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.040 --> 01:30:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.920 --> 01:31:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:13.109 --> 01:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%

you so much and I am also uh in the
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
distant past sat in that chair so it's
 
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
lovely to be here oh I thought you meant
 
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
it was this bill which which is also
 
01:32:43.149 --> 01:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
that's true too yeah no I was uh I was
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
talking about a reunion to legislative
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you um my name is
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
Lucy Weber I am representative for
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
chesher County 5 which is is the U
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River Town of Walpole and
 
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's adjacent town of
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
Sur this bill is has been before the
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee before it's a relatively
 
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
simple transparency
 
01:33:13.229 --> 01:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
measure it arose when I had a bill that
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
was very much time sensitive that had to
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
be passed and in effect by July 1st
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
because of the start of a fiscal year
 
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
for for um commercial appraisers because
 
01:33:30.189 --> 01:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
it was cons the concern was that without
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
the bill they might lose their Federal
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
certification and not be able to
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
certify um loan transactions
 
01:33:44.189 --> 01:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
so in any case as as June progressed and
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
the bill did not come out of once the
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
bills are passed there's the enrolling
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
process and the enrolling process is led
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
by the Secretary of State's office which
 
01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
gets the bills um to the um Speaker of
 
01:34:03.149 --> 01:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
the House for Signature and then the
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
Senate President for Signature there is
 
01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:08.360 align:start position:0%
the house has deadlines as you heard in
 
01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
bill the governor has deadlines once
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
things hit the governor's desk there are
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
no deadlines in between those things and
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of that is because things
 
01:34:20.189 --> 01:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
need to be fluid there are things like
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
the enrolling process and the things
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
that the uh ol has to do with a bill um
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
so I want to make it very clear that
 
01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
this bill does nothing to change any of
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
that the process is still the
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
process all I'm asking is that the
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State have either on their
 
01:34:43.709 --> 01:34:43.719 align:start position:0%
website or a link which might make it
 
01:34:46.109 --> 01:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
easier not have to revise their whole
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
website to a public facing listing of
 
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
where the bills are in the process so if
 
01:34:55.229 --> 01:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
they're at o Les if they're with the
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
house uh speaker if they're with the
 
01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
Senate President um we ultimately
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
located the bill that everybody in the
 
01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
Senate president's office that they
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
didn't have under a pile of other things
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
on a chair but I had to go and get
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Secretary of State's
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
office to come up and show them when it
 
01:35:13.149 --> 01:35:13.159 align:start position:0%
had been
 
01:35:16.189 --> 01:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
delivered uh and and
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
then the the the stuff needed to move it
 
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
along so my hope is is that we can go
 
01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
ahead with that now I I want to
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
apologize in advance I had fully
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
intended to talk to the Secretary of
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
State about this before this time but I
 
01:35:36.669 --> 01:35:36.679 align:start position:0%
as I just explained to him had a couple
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
of Fairly serious personal challenges
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of months which
 
01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
only really resolved over the last week
 
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
two weeks or so so um I haven't had a
 
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
lot of extra time but I will be talking
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
to him the other thing is that I I just
 
01:35:54.669 --> 01:35:54.679 align:start position:0%
as a matter of History I I initially
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
thought oh well this is easy it just
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
goes on in the docket that we keep
 
01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:02.360 align:start position:0%
anyway which is how you know exactly
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
where it is when something's in the
 
01:36:07.229 --> 01:36:07.239 align:start position:0%
possession of the house uh or or in the
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
possession of the Senate being dealt
 
01:36:09.199 --> 01:36:10.430 align:start position:0%
possession of the Senate being dealt
with

01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
legislatively but I did have a
 
01:36:15.709 --> 01:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
conversation with the house Clerk and
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
his concern is that because it's not in
 
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
the possession of the house anymore he
 
01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:24.030 align:start position:0%
the possession of the house anymore he
can't

01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
do the docketing necessary because they
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
don't have control of the information so
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
that's why it's not done that way and um
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
my recollection was this was passed by
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
the house on the consent calendar last
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
time around I'm hoping that that will
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
happen again and I promise that I will
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
go and have many more conversations with
 
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
Senators as well in the interim if we're
 
01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
successful thank you thank you uh
 
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
questions repr
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so I guess my
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
question is uh this specifies the
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State shall publish it um
 
01:37:05.229 --> 01:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
is there a reason it wouldn't be on gen
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
Court instead given that that already
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
has that tracking system that's exactly
 
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
what I was talking about when I said
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
that I I had spoken to the um uh house
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
Clerk and he'll he's here to testify so
 
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
he'll talk more about it but um our
 
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.350 align:start position:0%
he'll talk more about it but um our
docketing

01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
docketing
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
system is is run in my understanding by
 
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
the clerks of the house and the Senate
 
01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
and at the time that I'm talking about
 
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
the bills are no longer in the
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
possession of the house or in the
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
possession of the Senate they are being
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
tracked by the Secretary of State's
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
office and yes they may be sitting on a
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
desk in one or the other bodies but
 
01:37:50.109 --> 01:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
they're not strictly speaking in the
 
01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
possession of the body they're they're
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
under the purview of the Secretary of
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
State who is keeping track in their
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
office of where all of the bills are but
 
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
the only way you can find out where a
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
bill is is by either calling emailing or
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
going to that office and saying where's
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
my bill and I know that for uh the
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
clerks of the house and the Senate uh
 
01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
they get a significant amount of um
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
calls and spend a significant amount of
 
01:38:23.229 --> 01:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
time just answering the question as to
 
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
where the bills are and the answer for
 
01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
them is we don't know because they're
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
not in our possession at the
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
moment follow up um so to understand the
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's website and the Gen
 
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
Court website sort of have their own
 
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so the Secretary of State
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even if they have that
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
information wouldn't have the ability to
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
publish that on gen Court that's right
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's exactly correct thank you but
 
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
they would be have the
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
ability subject to I'm sure what you
 
01:38:58.750 --> 01:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
will hear from the Secretary of State to
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
do it on their website which tracks an
 
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of other information and
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
the reason for my language which said um
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
on their website or on a public website
 
01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
link to the public website is the
 
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office carries an
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
awful lot of very very sensitive
 
01:39:23.629 --> 01:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
information and I can't even imagine the
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
intricacies of dealing with their
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
website what I'm talking about is
 
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
basically an Excel spreadsheet available
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
to the public so um it's the sort of
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
thing where if if it's easier for them
 
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
to do a link to something else rather
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
than having to have a consultant come in
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
and redesign an important and and very
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
carefully designed
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
website however it's easiest and most
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
efficiently done is fine with me I'm
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
just trying to find a way for the public
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
and for all of us to be able to find the
 
01:40:01.229 --> 01:40:01.239 align:start position:0%
information easily and quickly and
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
without bothering two sets of offices
 
01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
when uh surely looking it up on the on
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
easier seeing no further questions thank
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you all very much
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
for your attention let's see what the
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
secretary of state has to say about the
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman members of
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm David scanland
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and I'm not taking a
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
position on the bill I but I would like
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
to provide some information about the
 
01:40:36.990 --> 01:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
process and I'll start with the
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is a unique
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional office and that uh
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
besides us in this in this treasury um
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
my office has one foot in the executive
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
branch of government and the other foot
 
01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
is in the legislative branch and part of
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
that respon responsibility is when bills
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
reach the point of transferring from the
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
legislature uh to the governor's office
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
for the action by the
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
executive and so uh we have this process
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
where once a bill uh receives final
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
action by the legislature it goes
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
through the enrolled bills process once
 
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
that process is complete the bill comes
 
01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
to the Secretary of State's office and
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
we wait until the house member and the
 
01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
Senate member or a House member or
 
01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
Senate member of the enrolled bills
 
01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
committee comes and they sign off on
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
that piece of
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
legislation once that occurs we deliver
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
the bill to the uh speaker of the house
 
01:41:44.109 --> 01:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
and the speaker can take as much time as
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
the speaker wants to sign off on the
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
bill and then it comes back to the
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and then we
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
deliver it to the Senate President and
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
the same thing occurs there now we can
 
01:42:01.629 --> 01:42:01.639 align:start position:0%
tell where the bill is on the records uh
 
01:42:04.109 --> 01:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
that we keep and anybody that calls the
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
office or visits the office and they
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
want to know where House Bill XYZ is we
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
can say it's either on the speaker's
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
desk or it's on the Senate president's
 
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
desk um or we have sent it to the
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
governor we could keep track of that
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
information on a spring sheet um but up
 
01:42:29.070 --> 01:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
until this point the legislature has
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
said no we want to keep the process the
 
01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
way that it is there may be reasons why
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
the leadership in the house or the
 
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
Senate wants to hang on to a bill at the
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
tail end of the session uh because we
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
all know this is a political process and
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
there are many parts of the process
 
01:42:49.149 --> 01:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
where there are things that happen
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes that are not
 
01:42:54.189 --> 01:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
transparent you may lobbyists that come
 
01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
and talk to you
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
individually you know about a specific
 
01:42:59.790 --> 01:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
Bill and that conversation is offline
 
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
but you know they're trying to persuade
 
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
you on how you should act on a on a
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
legislation both parties have caucuses
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
both in committee and before the
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
legislature and those conversations
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
about how a bill might be handled are
 
01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
not public it it's inhouse and so this
 
01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
process of the enrolled bills and how we
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
keep track of it is simply a part of
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
that legislative process and from my
 
01:43:29.229 --> 01:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
perspective it's up to the legislature
 
01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
to decide how the legislature wants to
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
keep track of those bills but there may
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
be reasons why uh
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh you don't want to have it on a
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet in the open public you know
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
for everybody to see uh instantly there
 
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
may be reasons why uh uh you know that
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
information is not as readily available
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
as it could be and with that I'll try
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
and answer questions representative
 
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
Richards uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
you um my question is
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
logistical um and
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
also I might go into a little hyperbole
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
as you answer the
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
logistics um just try the re the
 
01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
logistic theis but so in the instance
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
that was brought up where it was on the
 
01:44:29.310 --> 01:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
chair and you spoke that your office
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
does keep track of where those bills are
 
01:44:36.669 --> 01:44:36.679 align:start position:0%
um through the process of moving at the
 
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
the those enrolled bills um how would
 
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
that individual know is it only memory I
 
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
know I walked it down the hall or do
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
they have um a tracking mechanism um
 
01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
that is is current that is currently
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
maintained by someone in your office we
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
have a tracking me mechanism that is
 
01:45:01.709 --> 01:45:01.719 align:start position:0%
currently maintained so in that instance
 
01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
this is where the hyperboy comes in oh
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you that's um uh thank
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
you uh this is the hyperbole part um the
 
01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:13.070 align:start position:0%
you uh this is the hyperbole part um the
pipe

01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
pipe
 
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
bursts um in the
 
01:45:19.390 --> 01:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
office um and goes all over that chair
 
01:45:22.350 --> 01:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
so now that tracking me mechanism as an
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
as if an archist or something would be
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
able to say where that bill got
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
destroyed in some mechanism so we know
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%
that that can be
 
01:45:36.189 --> 01:45:36.199 align:start position:0%
maintained what we can tell you is from
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
the records that we keep Who has
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
possession of that piece of legislation
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
one more followup followup is that in a
 
01:45:48.510 --> 01:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet it is not uh maintained
 
01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
electronically it is not maintained
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
electronically right okay okay so
 
01:45:55.870 --> 01:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
there's no ability to back up thank you
 
01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:56.990 align:start position:0%
there's no ability to back up thank you
got

01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
it representative weight thank you Mr
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
chair um my question is is there a
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
reason this process is like an like
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
paper in the first place and why why
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you just have a digital system
 
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
to send this so you avoid issues of it
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
literally getting lost in a in a stack
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
of paper or a pipe bursting or anything
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
like that is there a reason this
 
01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't be digitized
 
01:46:26.109 --> 01:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
it could be digitized we we maintain a
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
process of just keeping the records on
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
paper it has worked for
 
01:46:34.830 --> 01:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
generations and uh and that's the
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
process I will add that that my office
 
01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
does not hold bills uh for an extended
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
period of time we do not get involved in
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know timing of stuff I mean that
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
there may be a day or two um before it
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
goes down to the governor for um you
 
01:46:57.070 --> 01:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
know signature veto Governor is 5 days
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
once the governor receives it but in
 
01:47:01.470 --> 01:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
terms of you know withholding a bill or
 
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
delaying it going to the house or the
 
01:47:05.709 --> 01:47:05.719 align:start position:0%
Senate we do not do that we move the
 
01:47:05.719 --> 01:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
Senate we do not do that we move the
legislation

01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:11.589 --> 01:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
along um just in your personal opinion
 
01:47:13.629 --> 01:47:13.639 align:start position:0%
do you think that this process would be
 
01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
better if it was
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
digitized the process as it is working
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
now has worked over time there have been
 
01:47:23.589 --> 01:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
no issues with it uh it it could be
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
digitized and you know that may or may
 
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
not be better but um the system that
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.589 --> 01:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
work I have a question um is uh can you
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
can you explain the purpose um you've
 
01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
explained the process of the enroll
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
bills committee can you explain for um
 
01:47:52.189 --> 01:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
our our lesser um veterans uh the
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of the the enrolled bills
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
process the purpose of the enrolled Bill
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
process is to make sure that the
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that has
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
passed has been
 
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh properly passed in other words
 
01:48:13.709 --> 01:48:13.719 align:start position:0%
once the bill passes both bodies it goes
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
through a process where uh people in uh
 
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
legislative Services is going through
 
01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
looking for spelling errors punctuation
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
errors uh maybe statutory reference
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
errors just to make sure that you know
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
the language is uh as it was intended
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
they are not supposed to make
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
any significant textual changes that
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
might change the you know the meaning of
 
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
the bill it's simply uh it's simply
 
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
routine proof reading basically and then
 
01:48:48.589 --> 01:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
and then the Secretary of State's office
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
being an independent goete between the
 
01:48:54.189 --> 01:48:54.199 align:start position:0%
the uh legislative offices and the
 
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
governor handle that part of the process
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
of making sure that each U presiding
 
01:49:04.109 --> 01:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
officer in both bodies signs off on the
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
bill you see what I did um
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative payer thank you Mr chair
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you would know this
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
um okay so I know this bill was in our
 
01:49:20.189 --> 01:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
committee last year and we passed it 16
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
to Zer then it went to the Senate and it
 
01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
was killed there do you know why they
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
killed it there uh I can speculate but I
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
don't know why oh
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
maybe Weber knows later we can ask her
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
again okay thank you representative
 
01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
senson did you have a question nope I
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
think we're all thank you very much
 
01:49:45.070 --> 01:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh last pink I had pink card I
 
01:49:48.510 --> 01:49:48.520 align:start position:0%

house thank you Mr Mr chairman sorry old
 
01:49:55.599 --> 01:49:57.350 align:start position:0%
house thank you Mr Mr chairman sorry old
habits

01:49:57.350 --> 01:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
habits
 
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
um so a couple of couple of quick points
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
that I I I want to Echo the sentiments
 
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
of Representative Weber and and again
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
thank her for for doing this um and and
 
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
I I will say that yes this will increase
 
01:50:13.950 --> 01:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
transparency in the legislative process
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
full stop um the fact remains that um I
 
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
I am in receipt of documents from the uh
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office when a bill
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
is chaptered uh that is done uh via a
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that is a continual rolling
 
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
document um and it also contains the
 
01:50:34.510 --> 01:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
information on what day it was delivered
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
to the governor and what day it was
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
returned from the governor um so my
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
opinion and this is just my opinion but
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
adding an additional column of when it
 
01:50:44.109 --> 01:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
was sent to the speaker and when it was
 
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
sent to the Senate President um I don't
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
think would be too terribly much of a
 
01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
lift um uh there are documents that I am
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
responsible personally for posting on
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
our website that are rolling documents
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
if you go on to our general court page
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
and you look at the resignation deaths
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
and special election page all I do is
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
update that with the newest version uh
 
01:51:08.189 --> 01:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
as it as it goes so I certainly think
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
that this is a a fairly um easy process
 
01:51:15.069 --> 01:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
that that can be done um after the bill
 
01:51:17.229 --> 01:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
is enrolled um it really does sort of
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
enter this black hole and I'm going to
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
give you an example um in 200 19 Senate
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 67 was enrolled uh on June 12th and
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
it wasn't vetoed by the governor until
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
August 16th so for two and a half months
 
01:51:36.510 --> 01:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
it was sitting in the Senate president's
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
office now during the course of that two
 
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
and a half months I received calls
 
01:51:44.589 --> 01:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
weekly asking where that bill was weekly
 
01:51:46.750 --> 01:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
um now I don't mind dealing with the
 
01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
public that's part of my job I love
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
talking to the public um but the fact
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
remains that as simple thing of just
 
01:51:55.950 --> 01:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
putting on the Secretary of State's
 
01:51:58.030 --> 01:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
website this document that says it's in
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
the Senate president's office that way
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
if if if a if a concerned constituent
 
01:52:05.790 --> 01:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
wants to call and ask Senate President
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
hey why are you doing this that's fine
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
um yes there are some political
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
considerations that that they might be
 
01:52:13.629 --> 01:52:13.639 align:start position:0%
holding the bill for a bill signing
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
ceremony which is this happens all the
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
time um and the Senate it's usually held
 
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
in the Senate president's office because
 
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
they're closer to the end of the process
 
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
than than the house is because the house
 
01:52:28.069 --> 01:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
Speaker signs it and then it goes back
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
to the SOS and then up to the Senate
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
President so the the the Senate
 
01:52:35.069 --> 01:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
president's office is usually the one
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
that where it holds for a while um so in
 
01:52:41.069 --> 01:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
that case uh you know there's there
 
01:52:43.069 --> 01:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
could be reasons and again those those
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
are known only to the Senate President
 
01:52:49.709 --> 01:52:49.719 align:start position:0%
and God not not me um I I would I would
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh mention again yes this bill did pass
 
01:52:54.270 --> 01:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
unanimously in the house last term uh in
 
01:52:56.189 --> 01:52:56.199 align:start position:0%
fact I testified in the Senate last term
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
and the then the new Senate President
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
now indicated at the time how much she
 
01:53:03.790 --> 01:53:03.800 align:start position:0%
supported the idea of this bill um and
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh there was a change of heart
 
01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
apparently um so hopefully we will
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
change the heart back this year I I
 
01:53:12.669 --> 01:53:12.679 align:start position:0%
think that would be good thing um uh and
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
and again uh in terms just to answer
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
specific questions that that came up
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
there are log books in each of the
 
01:53:22.069 --> 01:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
offices um and and I when I say log
 
01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
books I'm very specific when I when I
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
mention that each office in the
 
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
legislative process has a log book I
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
have a log book so when a bill is
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
brought um when when I bring a bill to
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh that has passed the house
 
01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
they sign my book when they bring a bill
 
01:53:42.069 --> 01:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
a Senate bill to the house I sign their
 
01:53:44.189 --> 01:53:44.199 align:start position:0%
book when I bring a bill down for
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
enrolling to the secret uh to the um uh
 
01:53:51.790 --> 01:53:51.800 align:start position:0%
to OS uh they signed my book um when
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
when we in the committee of conference
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
process and I brought a bill down there
 
01:53:57.870 --> 01:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
I have to sign for the bill back so
 
01:54:00.669 --> 01:54:00.679 align:start position:0%
every and and and similarly when a bill
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
is brought to the Secretary of State's
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
office from the speaker and vice versa
 
01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office and the Secretary
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
of State are all signing books um so
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
there is a tracking mechanism currently
 
01:54:14.669 --> 01:54:14.679 align:start position:0%
it is a hard copy it is a handwritten
 
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
thing um but yes it that is the process
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of keeping that
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
electronically I you know we do keep the
 
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
electronic uh system as it is now
 
01:54:30.069 --> 01:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
because there is a as I said um there is
 
01:54:33.069 --> 01:54:33.079 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet that is prepared uh and it
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
it contains what the chapter number of
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
the bill once it's signed becomes what
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
the effective dates are what day it was
 
01:54:41.709 --> 01:54:41.719 align:start position:0%
delivered to the governor and vice versa
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
um so you know that that is a that is a
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
a part of the process now uh the
 
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
secretary mentioned um the process
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
involving this the SOS uh that is a
 
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
relative ly new process in in the grand
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
scheme of government it started in the
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
70s that the the Secretary of State's
 
01:55:00.510 --> 01:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
office became involved in the enrolling
 
01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
process the 200 years prior to that the
 
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
clerks of the respective bodies uh went
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
directly to uh transmitting the bill to
 
01:55:10.589 --> 01:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
the governor and vice versa the
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution very specifically says when
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
the when a veto happens the bill goes
 
01:55:17.629 --> 01:55:17.639 align:start position:0%
directly to the house from which came um
 
01:55:19.390 --> 01:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
and there has been a delay and in fact
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
there was a delay under the previous
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State not this one uh there
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
was a delay in returning the bill that
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
that uh from the governor to my Cham to
 
01:55:30.910 --> 01:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
our chamber where I sent a letter uh
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
asking specifically should we consider
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
this enrolled as law now because I had
 
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
not received the veto message um so
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
again uh th those are those are part of
 
01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
a grander discussion if you'd like to
 
01:55:44.109 --> 01:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
have one but but uh uh you know again I
 
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:47.560 align:start position:0%
think this is a relatively minor piece
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh for for the sake of our constituents
 
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
and transparency that that would be a
 
01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:53.189 align:start position:0%
and transparency that that would be a
benefit

01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
I have one question before uh
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative Richards um why do they
 
01:56:00.589 --> 01:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
call your office and not secretary's
 
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
office because they don't know that the
 
01:56:05.709 --> 01:56:05.719 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's involved in that
 
01:56:07.870 --> 01:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
process because
 
01:56:10.589 --> 01:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
it's that most people don't understand
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
that the the the Secretary of State who
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
generally has a
 
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
public public facing appearance of being
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
involved within elections and businesses
 
01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
and that sort of stuff they don't know
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
generally um that that they're involved
 
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
in in this part of the legislative
 
01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
process thank you representative Richard
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
time for clarification for um the
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
process that you described with the
 
01:56:42.350 --> 01:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
logistics of signing those books
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
um the bill that is being sponsored does
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
not recommend a change to that
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
historical process no signing that
 
01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:55.719 align:start position:0%
actual book correct it is just and it
 
01:56:58.109 --> 01:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
would I did I hear
 
01:57:01.390 --> 01:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
your good
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
catch is uh uh did I hear the
 
01:57:08.069 --> 01:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
clarification that there is that this is
 
01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:11.320 align:start position:0%
a added digit would you describe it as
 
01:57:15.790 --> 01:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
an added digitization of that um
 
01:57:18.109 --> 01:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
historical signing of the book process
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh I I wouldn't because again the the
 
01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
document that tracks um the the chapter
 
01:57:29.470 --> 01:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
which the bill becomes uh it tracks when
 
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
it goes to the governor and when it's
 
01:57:33.629 --> 01:57:33.639 align:start position:0%
returned to the governor so it's it is a
 
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and by adding simply a
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
couple of columns saying to the speaker
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
to the Senate President uh with those
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
dates listed on the public facing
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
website I I that's that's my I think
 
01:57:48.030 --> 01:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I was trying to say that
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's digitized but in in essence
 
01:57:52.990 --> 01:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's digitizing you signing the books
 
01:57:54.910 --> 01:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
no it's it's not and and I I want to
 
01:57:56.830 --> 01:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
just because uh the secretary brought
 
01:57:59.470 --> 01:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
this up um in a previous question
 
01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:00.750 align:start position:0%
this up um in a previous question
statute

01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:58:02.669 --> 01:58:02.679 align:start position:0%
requires that everything has to be
 
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
signed so all of the bills themselves uh
 
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
if uh you all don't usually see these
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
okay but when you when here's your bill
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
um your bill is put in a um during the
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
during the process uh the legislative
 
01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
process they're put in Orange jackets in
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
the first year and and yellow in the
 
01:58:25.709 --> 01:58:25.719 align:start position:0%
second okay uh when and we docket all of
 
01:58:27.629 --> 01:58:27.639 align:start position:0%
the information that happens to the life
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill during the process when we
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
complete the process and we send the
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill down to the office of legislative
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
services for enrolling um secretary skin
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned the um the enrolling process
 
01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
now if there's an amendment that needs
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
to be made that he was talking about
 
01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
earlier like a correction to RSA
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh grammar grammar fix or that sort of
 
01:58:53.229 --> 01:58:53.239 align:start position:0%
thing um that is when we will adopt in a
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
small session of the house an enrolled
 
01:58:58.109 --> 01:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
Bill Amendment um and that enrolled Bill
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment will be made and then the
 
01:59:02.109 --> 01:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services will take
 
01:59:05.149 --> 01:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
the final version of the bill and put it
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
in a red jacket with a cover sheet and
 
01:59:11.069 --> 01:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
send that to the Secretary of State and
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
that cover sheet has lines for
 
01:59:16.109 --> 01:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
signatures and that those signatures are
 
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
there has to be somebody from the house
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
enrolled bills committee the Senate
 
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
enrolled bills committee the speaker of
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
the house and then the Senate President
 
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
and then the last line is for the
 
01:59:28.510 --> 01:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
governor um and so that's that's the
 
01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
actual physical document that is
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
required by law uh if you all want to
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
change that that's another topic I I
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recommend it because we need
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
something but uh but but again that's
 
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's the sort of the
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
process for policy WS this is the
 
01:59:47.470 --> 01:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
perfect committee to be in this is no
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
one else in this building knows how this
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
works except now you do
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
um personal opinion it's maybe why this
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
is uh the clerk's favorite committee um
 
02:00:03.629 --> 02:00:03.639 align:start position:0%
any other questions further questions
 
02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
you having no other pink cards uh I'll
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on
 
02:00:16.109 --> 02:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
331 um and as soon as we're up and ready
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
um we can jump
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
into 44
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%

complex I started thinking about this in
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
very general terms back in
 
02:02:23.229 --> 02:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
2023 on November 17th I was returning to
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
conquered from a meeting and I was
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
sitting at a red light when a police car
 
02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
flew by then another and another and
 
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
within minutes it was clear that
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
something horrible had happened at the
 
02:02:36.510 --> 02:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
time I thought well they're driving in
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
the opposite direction of the state
 
02:02:40.109 --> 02:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
house which at the time was a relief to
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
me but it was about 20 minutes later
 
02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
when I learned that there had been a
 
02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
tragic shooting at New Hampshire
 
02:02:48.149 --> 02:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
hospital this bill is an opportunity to
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
get ahead of a potential tragedy as a
 
02:02:52.109 --> 02:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
way to have an ongoing conversation on
 
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security as we all know these
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
buildings are open and filled on a daily
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
basis with staff legislators and members
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
of the public and everyone who enters
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
this space should know that they are
 
02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
entering a safe
 
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
space in July of 2021 the Council of
 
02:03:09.149 --> 02:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
state governments published an
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
insightful article titled the state of
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
State Capital Security which provides a
 
02:03:16.030 --> 02:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive look at the
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities and evolving challenges
 
02:03:20.830 --> 02:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
facing legislative buildings across the
 
02:03:24.069 --> 02:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
country the article emphasizes that many
 
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
state capital structures were designed
 
02:03:28.589 --> 02:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
long before the modern security
 
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
challenges we face today and as such
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
they often lack the robust safety
 
02:03:36.510 --> 02:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
features necessary to protect lawmakers
 
02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
staff in the
 
02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
public the bill before you proposes a
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
commission with 11 members from a
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
variety of Safety and Security
 
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and I did receive some
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
feedback on tweaking the membership if
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
the committee wishes to do so um to also
 
02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
include the conquered police chief or
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
his design the commission would be
 
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
charged with studying the feasibility of
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
implementing safety procedures including
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
things like the use of identification
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
badges visitor signin and screening and
 
02:04:06.669 --> 02:04:06.679 align:start position:0%
safety training evaluating the existing
 
02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
physical security systems identifying
 
02:04:11.549 --> 02:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
critical gaps in emergency response
 
02:04:14.589 --> 02:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
protocols and access control
 
02:04:17.109 --> 02:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
recommending modern adaptable solutions
 
02:04:19.149 --> 02:04:19.159 align:start position:0%
that reflect both current and future
 
02:04:21.790 --> 02:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
security needs learning from best
 
02:04:23.950 --> 02:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
practices observed in other states and
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
sectors to build a resilient and
 
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
proactive security framework an interim
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
report would be delivered by November
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
1st of 2025 with a subsequent report the
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
following year by establishing this
 
02:04:37.870 --> 02:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
commission it is my hope that our state
 
02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
with legislative oversight can take a
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
measured evidence-based approach to
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
upgrading our state house security
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
measures ensuring that our legislative
 
02:04:47.629 --> 02:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
buildings not only protect those within
 
02:04:50.189 --> 02:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
but also reinforce public confidence in
 
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
the safety of our democratic processes
 
02:04:54.589 --> 02:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
while this work is taking place in other
 
02:04:56.549 --> 02:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
forms it is my view that creating this
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
commission does fill a gap and I thank
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
consideration are there
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
questions I have one um are you aware of
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh any
 
02:05:13.149 --> 02:05:13.159 align:start position:0%
internal processes that um are perhaps
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
doing what uh your bill entails yeah um
 
02:05:20.830 --> 02:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
yes I well I did have a conversation
 
02:05:24.589 --> 02:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
with um Chris feter um we've discussed
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
um had a very robust conversation about
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
it and while he obviously is not
 
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
supporting or opposing the bill um he
 
02:05:33.629 --> 02:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
did say any conversation on Safety and
 
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
Security is a good conversation um and I
 
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
do know that the um after the shooting
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh the governor did prop um request an
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
assessment of all state buildings for
 
02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security um the status of the
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
legislative complex um that assessment
 
02:05:54.750 --> 02:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
um has not yet happened the timeline is
 
02:05:57.390 --> 02:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
somewhat extended as far as I understand
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and I just feel that um there is an
 
02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have multiple
 
02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
conversations on
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
um I also sit as the chair of the school
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
building authority and and that puts me
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
on the committee called Public School
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um where we typically are
 
02:06:24.189 --> 02:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
review doing with Homeland Security all
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
of the schools uh within our
 
02:06:28.199 --> 02:06:30.350 align:start position:0%
of the schools uh within our
borders

02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
borders
 
02:06:35.109 --> 02:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
99.9% of that is um in closed session um
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
for obvious reasons I
 
02:06:41.950 --> 02:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
think um you can see perhaps some of the
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
concern that some of us have with doing
 
02:06:48.669 --> 02:06:48.679 align:start position:0%
a bill of this type and a commission of
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
the size that this one may be um is that
 
02:06:57.069 --> 02:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
something that enters into this I
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
understand the concerns about um showing
 
02:07:02.709 --> 02:07:02.719 align:start position:0%
all of our cards to everything but when
 
02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
we talk about um digging into what other
 
02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
states do for their Security Buildings
 
02:07:10.750 --> 02:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
and and what is already out there in
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
public knowledge I think that there's a
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
lot to learn um if you look at this
 
02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
article that I was referencing the state
 
02:07:19.149 --> 02:07:19.159 align:start position:0%
of State Capital Security I mean there's
 
02:07:22.030 --> 02:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of data out there that I think is
 
02:07:26.669 --> 02:07:26.679 align:start position:0%
valuable to look into um which buildings
 
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
utilize you know um visitor signin which
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
buildings utilize um metal detectors
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
which buildings require identification
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
as you enter the building I think that
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to learn that we're
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
not letting anything out there to the
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
public in terms of our security systems
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
that we have established and I do think
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
that there um is an opportunity to learn
 
02:07:53.350 --> 02:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
more and learn from other states in
 
02:07:55.549 --> 02:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
their pursuit of making sure that their
 
02:07:59.069 --> 02:07:59.079 align:start position:0%
their complexes are safe so it's not so
 
02:08:00.750 --> 02:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
much what we're doing it's what we're
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
not doing no I think that um and I said
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
this to uh Mr veter that I believe that
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
um the security team here is great it I
 
02:08:15.470 --> 02:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
feel that they are moving forward with
 
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
even changes in the last few years that
 
02:08:19.470 --> 02:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
are positive um but I feel it's an
 
02:08:22.709 --> 02:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
ongoing conversation and I do feel that
 
02:08:24.669 --> 02:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
um there are maybe some other members
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
that have had concerns um that there's
 
02:08:31.069 --> 02:08:31.079 align:start position:0%
always something to discuss so for
 
02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
example um when knocking around
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
different ideas just today when I was
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
walking across the street from the um L
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
into the state house um a gentleman um
 
02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:43.559 align:start position:0%
approached the back door as I pulled out
 
02:08:45.870 --> 02:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
my pass he tried the door and I knew
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what was going to happen um I
 
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
didn't say anything and he
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
I said oh you're going to have to go
 
02:08:54.990 --> 02:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
around and he said well can I just go in
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
with on with yours and knowing I was
 
02:09:00.430 --> 02:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
coming into this I said no I would
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
prefer you wouldn't they monitor the
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
security on this store right so right
 
02:09:08.229 --> 02:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
there maybe that is a training situation
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
I would love to see more training
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities with legislators and with
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
staff in the building you know that has
 
02:09:16.669 --> 02:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with with putting things
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
out there but simply making us better
 
02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
stewards of the safety of our workspace
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
um another thing is packages and bags
 
02:09:27.229 --> 02:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
how many times have we all walked into
 
02:09:29.790 --> 02:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
the Hall of flags and we see piles of
 
02:09:31.709 --> 02:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
backpacks and coats and everything you
 
02:09:34.430 --> 02:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
know that's just what we are we welcome
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know communities to come in and and
 
02:09:40.109 --> 02:09:40.119 align:start position:0%
tour our building but is there a process
 
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
for that in case there is a bag that is
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
left unattended um I'm trying to think
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
what other ones I already mentioned the
 
02:09:49.950 --> 02:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
three that I jotted down and then the
 
02:09:52.109 --> 02:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
only other one was that REM most recent
 
02:09:54.669 --> 02:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
incident that happened down in um New
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
Orleans with a vehicle and and building
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
barriers and you know just what's the
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
situation with our system you know do we
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
have um have we taken the best practices
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of securing our building and
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
keeping it safe and are there other
 
02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
things we can learn
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
that's okay yeah thank you f questions
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
represent pay could you send those
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
documents in your what you wrote to all
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%

02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
article that I reference also okay thank
 
02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
you representative way thank you Mr
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
chair um so on on the note of concern of
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
if we were to undergo this review and
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
then that would kind of expose what the
 
02:10:44.549 --> 02:10:44.559 align:start position:0%
security flaws are do these meetings
 
02:10:48.589 --> 02:10:48.599 align:start position:0%
have to be public record um okay gotcha
 
02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
just to understand I know you mentioned
 
02:10:53.870 --> 02:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
that the closed door meetings um in a
 
02:10:55.709 --> 02:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
different committee that you are a part
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
of but that's not an option here no okay
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
rep I'm sorry yes
 
02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
go two hours um this is also a
 
02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
procedural question is there a
 
02:11:13.629 --> 02:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
ability when the session is making
 
02:11:18.350 --> 02:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
rules um to re
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
to look at some of the very important
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
things that you brought up um in
 
02:11:29.549 --> 02:11:29.559 align:start position:0%
processes each session under rules sorry
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
I defer to the
 
02:11:33.790 --> 02:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
clerk uh the clerk has not put in a pink
 
02:11:35.310 --> 02:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
card but
 
02:11:39.629 --> 02:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
maybe uh to comment um I also should let
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know that um I've had conversations
 
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
with um our coo um Terry PA and um and
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
um Chris veter and both of them are
 
02:11:56.430 --> 02:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
in other circumstances and can't testify
 
02:12:00.270 --> 02:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
today but we will talk to them um right
 
02:12:03.390 --> 02:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
before we exec the bill so that's good
 
02:12:05.950 --> 02:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
if that helps thank you Mr shairon I
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
come from a time this is for the
 
02:12:10.109 --> 02:12:10.119 align:start position:0%
committee um when this was always called
 
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
the people's house of business security
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
was light very very light and um I
 
02:12:19.069 --> 02:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate you're bringing this bill
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
forward today um I feel great great
 
02:12:23.870 --> 02:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
confidence that our security
 
02:12:27.069 --> 02:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
teams um are working together Chris
 
02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
betterer I understand is recently over
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
from uh the state police and they're
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
constantly working on things and I
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
learned last week we have more cameras
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
than ever before in places we're not
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
even aware of um constantly watching the
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah you're being watched and um so
 
02:12:48.069 --> 02:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
I appreciate this this is important you
 
02:12:50.189 --> 02:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
know no matter how much security we have
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
it'll never be enough there'll always be
 
02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
some way but I think it's important that
 
02:12:56.430 --> 02:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
we have an understanding so thank you
 
02:12:58.589 --> 02:12:58.599 align:start position:0%
for bringing the bill forward thank you
 
02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
could I just comment one quick thing
 
02:13:02.589 --> 02:13:02.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely I do want to say that um I
 
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
made it very clear with um Mr veter that
 
02:13:08.830 --> 02:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
this is this bill has nothing to do as a
 
02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:10.559 align:start position:0%
it's not a statement against his work
 
02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
the work of our hardworking security
 
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
team here I have full respect for them
 
02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:17.400 align:start position:0%

02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
them in their job and um he and I had a
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
wonderful conversation about the the
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
whole thing and the intent of the bill
 
02:13:24.189 --> 02:13:24.199 align:start position:0%

also from NASA I thank her for bringing
 
02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
this bill before uh you all today so
 
02:13:56.350 --> 02:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
your your committee room seems pretty
 
02:13:58.430 --> 02:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
calm right now but uh the committee I
 
02:14:00.549 --> 02:14:00.559 align:start position:0%
serve on is children and family law it
 
02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
is not usually that calm just as you
 
02:14:06.109 --> 02:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
know in U police situations where some
 
02:14:08.350 --> 02:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
of the most uh dangerous calls they go
 
02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
on are Domestic Relations uh we have
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
very high um emotion high risk type of
 
02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
cases that come before us people that
 
02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
have you know trying to hold on to their
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
families and whether not they have made
 
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
good decisions with how they bring up
 
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
their family or not the desire to hold
 
02:14:28.510 --> 02:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
on to one's family um I'm not sure
 
02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
there's anything more as a matter of
 
02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
fact I sat in this particular committee
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
room also on the special committee on
 
02:14:35.790 --> 02:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
DCF I also served on the special
 
02:14:38.549 --> 02:14:38.559 align:start position:0%
Committee of family courts um we had
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
particular security concerns and all
 
02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
three of those um one particular um
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
individual was known throughout the
 
02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
state uh as being a security risk from
 
02:14:53.069 --> 02:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
the U Mayor Don and Manchester to um the
 
02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
governor's office here he was not able
 
02:14:57.629 --> 02:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
to um go into the governor's office
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
anymore including the uh domestic
 
02:15:03.390 --> 02:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
violence um Coalition across the street
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
they even had to change how they do
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
security because of this gentleman he
 
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
continued to come into our committee
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
rooms sometimes had multiple bags uh
 
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
would get very um elevated sent a
 
02:15:19.709 --> 02:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
message to another representative that
 
02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
he understood why the shooting that
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
happened in Maine happened because the
 
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
legislature was not doing um right by
 
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
that gentleman and so that's why that
 
02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
shooting happened which we call A Veiled
 
02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
Threat um we had a security meeting with
 
02:15:38.589 --> 02:15:38.599 align:start position:0%
u Mr faf and some other security members
 
02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
at that time about you know what our
 
02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
concerns were because there they had
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
said that they would be in the room when
 
02:15:46.830 --> 02:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
he was there they would be there one
 
02:15:49.310 --> 02:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
time um they actually said that they
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
have facial recognition on the camera
 
02:15:54.750 --> 02:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
here which would be amazing but he was
 
02:15:57.549 --> 02:15:57.559 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's okay but he was in
 
02:15:59.310 --> 02:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
the building and in our room for 10
 
02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
minutes before I finally was able to
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
leave and go get security and they were
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
shocked that he was there again we have
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
had people come into our committee room
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
with giant knives um on their belt and
 
02:16:14.549 --> 02:16:14.559 align:start position:0%
you know in very heated discussions and
 
02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff continues to happen
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
and while I think that sometimes we want
 
02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
to keep our security measures quiet and
 
02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
and I understand that there are a lot of
 
02:16:26.430 --> 02:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
people that are deterred by having you
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
know an armed police officer in the room
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know when you understand and we we
 
02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
actually said that so I was in you know
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
this security meeting explaining to them
 
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
that this is a real deterrent because
 
02:16:39.549 --> 02:16:39.559 align:start position:0%
what's interesting is in these
 
02:16:42.030 --> 02:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
personality traits of someone who maybe
 
02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
um is an abuser in the home or whatever
 
02:16:46.830 --> 02:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
they have this really interesting tick
 
02:16:50.110 --> 02:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
where they have a a certain level of
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
fear maybe going to jail for whatever
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
reason that is the hierarchy in jail who
 
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
knows but they have they have that in
 
02:17:01.389 --> 02:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
just having an armed officer in the room
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
makes a huge different it's a huge
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
deterrent um on that
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
same token uh you know when you look at
 
02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:12.599 align:start position:0%
where we are when we are in session and
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
we have an open space above us that
 
02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
certainly isn't safe for any of us the
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
way that it's currently done as a matter
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
of fact when this gentleman was Contin
 
02:17:23.070 --> 02:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
to come and contining to elevate you
 
02:17:25.629 --> 02:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
know I said what what kind of security
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
do we have up there they said well
 
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's outside the door well so what
 
02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
happens if somebody's already in that
 
02:17:35.469 --> 02:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
room and it starts you know we have to
 
02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
have better watching so they did start
 
02:17:38.910 --> 02:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
for the next couple times they had
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
somebody that was you know Security in
 
02:17:43.709 --> 02:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
you know um in the gallery up there but
 
02:17:45.469 --> 02:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
I think there are some certain misses
 
02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
because even though we had this very
 
02:17:50.990 --> 02:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
long security meeting you know we had um
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
guarantees that when an individual was
 
02:17:54.389 --> 02:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
in the building they would make sure
 
02:17:56.750 --> 02:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
they had somebody there um one time they
 
02:17:59.709 --> 02:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
were the security was outside the room
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
and then if something happened they
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
would come in um another time there were
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
three other times we had to either call
 
02:18:10.750 --> 02:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
or we had to um go get security to get
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
them in there and these are very
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
elevated situations luckily nothing
 
02:18:16.349 --> 02:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
happened but that's not to say that
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
that's not going to happen and my
 
02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
concern is and my um actually my
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
gratefulness of having a bill like this
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
come forward is as legislators hey we're
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
not paid enough for this kind of um you
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
know threat to us where we're having
 
02:18:31.709 --> 02:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
escorts out to our cars or whatever else
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
but also I think that we have a real
 
02:18:36.910 --> 02:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
need to look at our security certainly
 
02:18:39.030 --> 02:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
the political climate is is not
 
02:18:41.230 --> 02:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
dampering down at all it's gone up we
 
02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
saw that even with um president Trump
 
02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
having his um life on the line this last
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
year and I think it's something that as
 
02:18:51.070 --> 02:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
a legislature we should be involved
 
02:18:53.389 --> 02:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
because it's our safety and our lives
 
02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's a part of this I have a uh
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
somebody I went to school with who's a
 
02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
republican legislator in Missouri she
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
was shocked to find out that we didn't
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
have something like a a signin or metal
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
detectors for our visitors you know
 
02:19:07.349 --> 02:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
there are certain things I think we
 
02:19:09.190 --> 02:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
could be doing and I think it's very
 
02:19:11.950 --> 02:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
important that as a legislature we take
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
this step and say this our safety is
 
02:19:16.030 --> 02:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
important and we do want to take these
 
02:19:18.270 --> 02:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
steps and I think it's okay if the
 
02:19:19.950 --> 02:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
public understands that we are taking
 
02:19:21.669 --> 02:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
more security measures because I
 
02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
guarantee you they understand what we
 
02:19:25.549 --> 02:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
don't have right now because they
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
continue to come in they continue to
 
02:19:29.549 --> 02:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
spout off saying I know I'm not supposed
 
02:19:31.309 --> 02:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
to be in the governor's office but here
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
I am this is an elevated situation and I
 
02:19:36.190 --> 02:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
think if you're not in these committees
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
every single day you don't understand we
 
02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
actually had to have somebody from the
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
courts have an escort out just a week
 
02:19:43.309 --> 02:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
ago um because of an elevation in
 
02:19:46.270 --> 02:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
committee so it our security concerns
 
02:19:49.230 --> 02:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
are high I have had security
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
conversations multiple
 
02:19:53.070 --> 02:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
with the security people here I think
 
02:19:54.670 --> 02:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing a very good job but I
 
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
think it always helps to have that extra
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
kind of you know look at what's going
 
02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
on thank you
 
02:20:06.429 --> 02:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:20:08.190 --> 02:20:08.200 align:start position:0%

02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
of Durham which is the uh straford
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
County District 10 um I I just want to
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
Echo my support of the importance of us
 
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
looking at safety and safety concerns um
 
02:20:36.389 --> 02:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
in my first term I uh needed to speak
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
with my local police department on four
 
02:20:40.429 --> 02:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
separate occasions based on emails that
 
02:20:43.870 --> 02:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
I received um I had to I was formally
 
02:20:49.630 --> 02:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
doxed by uh one of our state uh citizens
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
um I had to request that my 80-year-old
 
02:20:54.790 --> 02:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
neighbors keep their um cameras on at
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
all times so that they could make sure
 
02:20:58.830 --> 02:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
that no one was approaching I had to
 
02:21:01.150 --> 02:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
warn my children to be on the lookout
 
02:21:04.270 --> 02:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
for things um we have challenges I
 
02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
received another threat Just A Week Ago
 
02:21:08.990 --> 02:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and our state house security has been
 
02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
phenomenal um and I I see you looking at
 
02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
me rean with some surprise but the
 
02:21:16.349 --> 02:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
threats have been or maybe not maybe I'm
 
02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting but the threats have
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
been based sometimes based on my
 
02:21:21.790 --> 02:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
religion um but the most recent one was
 
02:21:23.469 --> 02:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
because I made a statement supporting
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
people being vaccinated um not mandating
 
02:21:28.349 --> 02:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
anything just supporting that and
 
02:21:30.190 --> 02:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
received additional comments associated
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
with that our state house people are
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
fabulous and they work really hard to
 
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
get to the bottom of things and share
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
information but I just feel like we need
 
02:21:39.550 --> 02:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
to take a deeper dive at a recent
 
02:21:41.550 --> 02:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
conference in South Carolina with
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
legislators um from across the
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
country the level the the difference in
 
02:21:49.309 --> 02:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
what was offered to people at different
 
02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
states was incredible um in South
 
02:21:53.750 --> 02:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
Carolina if you feel unsafe at your home
 
02:21:55.150 --> 02:21:55.160 align:start position:0%
they'll send State House security to
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
your house to monitor it and you know
 
02:22:00.550 --> 02:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
transport you as needed um in other
 
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
states they have you know varying levels
 
02:22:04.270 --> 02:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
depending on the state I recognize we
 
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources for a lot of
 
02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
those things but I do feel that we need
 
02:22:10.030 --> 02:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
more work done on ensuring that we're
 
02:22:11.469 --> 02:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
all safe at all times just for
 
02:22:13.710 --> 02:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
everyone's best
 
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
interests further
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
02:22:27.950 --> 02:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
card our Clerk of the
 
02:22:34.910 --> 02:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
house thank you Mr chairman this was uh
 
02:22:36.270 --> 02:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
essentially to address a couple of
 
02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
questions that came up um specific
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
question came up regarding rules uh I do
 
02:22:45.070 --> 02:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
want to just be clear that the security
 
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
institution uh falls under the purview
 
02:22:51.070 --> 02:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
of our joint legislative fa facilities
 
02:22:55.230 --> 02:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
committee I also want to comment that
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
the building itself and the policies of
 
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
the committee rooms fall under that same
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee's purview um that committee
 
02:23:06.270 --> 02:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
does receive classified briefings that
 
02:23:07.990 --> 02:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
committee does receive security
 
02:23:10.750 --> 02:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
assessments from our fantastic security
 
02:23:13.389 --> 02:23:13.399 align:start position:0%
folks we are we have been undergoing
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
security situation uh reviews and we are
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
partnering with our folks over at
 
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
Homeland as we speak right now on many
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
of those issues including drills um so I
 
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
I do want to just clarify that the the
 
02:23:27.550 --> 02:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
the committee The Joint facilities
 
02:23:29.230 --> 02:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
committee which is a nonpartisan
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
committee it is the
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
administrative um Wing that that deals
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
with the oversight of the building um in
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
terms of the not only the Safety and
 
02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
Security but the construct of the new
 
02:23:43.750 --> 02:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
building behind you uh which hopefully
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
you'll all be able to park in relatively
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
soon um but but those uh that is where
 
02:23:53.230 --> 02:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
um you me you asked about rules uh the
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
our rules are very specific about
 
02:23:57.230 --> 02:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
security Personnel in the chamber and I
 
02:23:58.910 --> 02:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
want to make that clear too there is a
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
distinction between the chamber and
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
everywhere else the chamber is under the
 
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
direction of the speaker and the
 
02:24:09.429 --> 02:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
speaker's sergeant-at-arms there is a
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
rule specifically that says the speaker
 
02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
can designate an additional security
 
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
person for the room when we are in
 
02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
session and um and that is a a purview
 
02:24:23.230 --> 02:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
that the the speaker has everything
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
outside of that falls under the
 
02:24:27.150 --> 02:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
direction of the joint facilities
 
02:24:29.469 --> 02:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
committee uh including security
 
02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
including uh responses and partnering
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
with other state agencies which we are
 
02:24:37.150 --> 02:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
doing uh as we undertake these reviews
 
02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
so just wanted to uh answer that
 
02:24:41.950 --> 02:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
question and
 
02:24:45.309 --> 02:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
um Mr clerk so just help me on the rule
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
can a can the body make a rule to
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
instruct the
 
02:25:00.030 --> 02:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan joint
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
what because the short answer the short
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
answer is no the short answer is no
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
because the The Joint if I may The Joint
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
Committee on legislative facilities
 
02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
established by Statute the house rules
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
apply to the house not to the Senate
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
which is a co-equal partner therefore
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
for the joint correct okay that thank
 
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:24.950 align:start position:0%

for uh underlying that for me um and
 
02:25:32.269 --> 02:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
that to do what to ask you would be you
 
02:25:34.349 --> 02:25:34.359 align:start position:0%
know in a point of Education or you
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
brought up drills or things that would
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
move us forward um uh to address the
 
02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
evolving um issues at a time so that was
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
where I was going with that you
 
02:25:49.150 --> 02:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
clarified that question but but to that
 
02:25:50.910 --> 02:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
point representative I I do want to just
 
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
mention that there are plans underway
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm loathed to discuss those uh on
 
02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
on camera at the moment because we we do
 
02:25:59.269 --> 02:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
have some some events and activities
 
02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
that are being planned for the next year
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
um that that will involve all of you um
 
02:26:06.510 --> 02:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
but will not be discussed publicly so
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
follow up just in follow up in the fact
 
02:26:10.349 --> 02:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
that you know you mentioned the building
 
02:26:12.750 --> 02:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
being constructed therefore we and and
 
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
then there we also know there will be
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
renovations to this building and so
 
02:26:19.230 --> 02:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
those all of those things would impact
 
02:26:21.309 --> 02:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
me so those would be other things for
 
02:26:24.990 --> 02:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
how do we as the house instruct our
 
02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
safety through that joint
 
02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
facility and give a bar to that thank
 
02:26:30.319 --> 02:26:31.630 align:start position:0%
facility and give a bar to that thank
you

02:26:31.630 --> 02:26:31.640 align:start position:0%

02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:33.150 align:start position:0%
you
absolutely

02:26:33.150 --> 02:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:26:36.590 --> 02:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
s thank you Mr chair how does the joint
 
02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
facilities committee decide what they're
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:26:44.269 --> 02:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
address uh they they can take up
 
02:26:46.990 --> 02:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
whatever they want um they uh they have
 
02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
taken up uh the issue of um uh
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
earlier today you you saw a person bring
 
02:26:57.790 --> 02:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
in a flag attached to a pole um they are
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
the persons that set up the policy of of
 
02:27:03.710 --> 02:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
what's allowed within the building um so
 
02:27:05.389 --> 02:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
you can have a placard that you're
 
02:27:09.110 --> 02:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
holding but you can't have a a wooden um
 
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh stake attached to a sign um for uh
 
02:27:16.110 --> 02:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
that those are those are the types of
 
02:27:18.349 --> 02:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
policies that facilities will determine
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
they'll also give um as I said they uh
 
02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
this the staff uh the COO which um
 
02:27:26.790 --> 02:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
director veter is here now uh director
 
02:27:29.870 --> 02:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
veter works under the COO um and uh
 
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
they're all responsible directly to um
 
02:27:35.710 --> 02:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
The Joint facilities
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
committee representative Mr chair um so
 
02:27:40.670 --> 02:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
given that the joint facilities
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
committee is established by
 
02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
Statute um you can't instruct them just
 
02:27:48.030 --> 02:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
using a house rule to my understanding
 
02:27:50.590 --> 02:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
so would it just be possible to amend
 
02:27:53.429 --> 02:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
this bill to say rather than establish a
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
new committee that um the requirements
 
02:27:59.230 --> 02:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
under this bill would just be assigned
 
02:28:02.110 --> 02:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
to the Joint facilities committee would
 
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
that be possible I I think you could
 
02:28:06.389 --> 02:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
amend the bill to say that the this this
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
is a directive to the Joint facilities
 
02:28:10.349 --> 02:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
committee to undertake this review um
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
and and what in instead of dismissing
 
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
all of the persons that are listed
 
02:28:16.429 --> 02:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
within uh the text of the bill uh you
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
could just say that they would consult
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
with them
 
02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
thank I don't see the sergeant-at-arms
 
02:28:26.670 --> 02:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned on this listed in I I I
 
02:28:28.630 --> 02:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
noticed that as well
 
02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:31.349 align:start position:0%
noticed that as well
okay

02:28:31.349 --> 02:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm not
 
02:28:37.309 --> 02:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
sure whether I want to
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
um on camera have uh director vet and
 
02:28:43.269 --> 02:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman that's that's why I I
 
02:28:44.830 --> 02:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
only stepped forward to speak to
 
02:28:46.269 --> 02:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
representative richards's question
 
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
because I there are some things that
 
02:28:49.630 --> 02:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
that I don't think we need to get into
 
02:28:54.030 --> 02:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
today um so understand
 
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
agreed um I'm not sure there was any
 
02:29:00.269 --> 02:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
questions I think I would suggest that
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
if you have further questions you take
 
02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
them offline um and and discuss them
 
02:29:09.070 --> 02:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
with director veter um individually and
 
02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:11.120 align:start position:0%

representative Kelly Penza straford
 
03:58:54.110 --> 03:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
District 19 um I um I'm just going to
 
03:58:55.429 --> 03:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
get right into it because I have to go
 
03:58:58.309 --> 03:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
testify at another bill so basically um
 
03:59:00.790 --> 03:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
as we know just the definition taxpayer
 
03:59:02.189 --> 03:59:02.199 align:start position:0%
funded lobbying is where public
 
03:59:04.189 --> 03:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
officials use public dollars to advocate
 
03:59:07.590 --> 03:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
for Public Policy uh the blatant misuse
 
03:59:10.189 --> 03:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
of taxpayer dollars is undemocratic goes
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
against the free speech of the taxpayer
 
03:59:14.149 --> 03:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
and is one of the reasons for contining
 
03:59:15.750 --> 03:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
infringement on the rights of New
 
03:59:19.110 --> 03:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens who we work for and
 
03:59:21.790 --> 03:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
if I were to guess 99% of the New
 
03:59:24.550 --> 03:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers have absolutely no
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
idea they are funding the expansion of
 
03:59:30.189 --> 03:59:30.199 align:start position:0%
government to their and their fam's own
 
03:59:32.710 --> 03:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
detriment how is this a violation of the
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers Free Speech well one it's
 
03:59:37.550 --> 03:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
compelled speech given that the interest
 
03:59:40.030 --> 03:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
of citizens May differ from those of
 
03:59:42.349 --> 03:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
their governments citizens legislative
 
03:59:44.309 --> 03:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
Lobby efforts towards state State
 
03:59:46.910 --> 03:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
elected officials might be adversely
 
03:59:49.790 --> 03:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
affected by the distinct disadvantage
 
03:59:51.309 --> 03:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
they face when contending with the
 
03:59:54.070 --> 03:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
agenda of taxpayer funded lobbyists
 
03:59:55.790 --> 03:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
hired by political
 
03:59:58.510 --> 03:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
subdivisions additionally these taxpayer
 
04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
funded lobbying efforts often take
 
04:00:02.830 --> 04:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
positions contrary to the taxpayers
 
04:00:05.149 --> 04:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
policy preferences as an example
 
04:00:07.469 --> 04:00:07.479 align:start position:0%
homeowners may prefer lower property
 
04:00:10.590 --> 04:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
taxes while a taxing jurisdiction may be
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
employing lobbyists through an
 
04:00:14.710 --> 04:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
association to protect or even raise
 
04:00:17.990 --> 04:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
property taxes is there anything more
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
absurd than the Department of
 
04:00:22.710 --> 04:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation using gas taxes to pay
 
04:00:25.750 --> 04:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
lobbyists to advocate for higher gas
 
04:00:28.990 --> 04:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
taxes or the concept of public school
 
04:00:31.550 --> 04:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
administrators shifting money from
 
04:00:33.550 --> 04:00:33.560 align:start position:0%
school budgets to pay lobbyists to
 
04:00:36.189 --> 04:00:36.199 align:start position:0%
advocate for more school funding with a
 
04:00:38.429 --> 04:00:38.439 align:start position:0%

04:01:47.429 --> 04:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
so historically and based upon the
 
04:01:50.349 --> 04:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
preview that I've had of just the
 
04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
legislation in that one area of their
 
04:01:56.590 --> 04:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
site um they are supporting and opposing
 
04:01:59.149 --> 04:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
is usually about four to one favoring
 
04:02:01.830 --> 04:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
one party the less conservative party
 
04:02:04.349 --> 04:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
over the other so on their website they
 
04:02:06.149 --> 04:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
say that they are a nonprofit
 
04:02:08.670 --> 04:02:08.680 align:start position:0%

04:02:20.560 --> 04:02:21.269 align:start position:0%
Association since 1941 that's all great
I

04:02:21.269 --> 04:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
think I don't know I don't even know
 
04:02:25.149 --> 04:02:25.159 align:start position:0%
what the percentage is let's say 80% of
 
04:02:27.149 --> 04:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
what they do is fantastic they provide
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
Legal Services they have trainings they
 
04:02:31.349 --> 04:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
have wonderful things but they should
 
04:02:35.149 --> 04:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
not be taking money from right now which
 
04:02:37.870 --> 04:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
234 uh pretty much every single every
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
single town and municipality as well as
 
04:02:46.990 --> 04:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
54 different districts Villages Village
 
04:02:48.710 --> 04:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know water districts all of these
 
04:02:51.830 --> 04:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
other things of course counties as well
 
04:02:56.469 --> 04:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
um to Lobby legislation when their
 
04:02:58.990 --> 04:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
people don't have any clue what's going
 
04:03:01.870 --> 04:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
on those are all public employees that
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
are paying to come go against the
 
04:03:10.189 --> 04:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
people so right now if you look at some
 
04:03:12.990 --> 04:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
of the pieces that they say that they
 
04:03:15.110 --> 04:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
support or post that's all right on
 
04:03:17.389 --> 04:03:17.399 align:start position:0%
their website happy to send you every
 
04:03:19.309 --> 04:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
bit of links that you
 
04:03:22.630 --> 04:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
need it says you know the um nhma
 
04:03:24.309 --> 04:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
supports funding of state aid to
 
04:03:26.550 --> 04:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities supports legislation
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
authorizing local control over
 
04:03:32.309 --> 04:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
non-property tax revenue streams and
 
04:03:34.710 --> 04:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
opposes legislation that reduces
 
04:03:37.149 --> 04:03:37.159 align:start position:0%
suspends or eliminates existing local
 
04:03:41.550 --> 04:03:41.560 align:start position:0%
taxes fees or state aid um they have
 
04:03:44.590 --> 04:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
they oppose an establishment um excuse
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
me they support an establishment of an
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
independent redistri redistricting
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
commission to draw election districts
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
fairly and without regard to partisan
 
04:03:57.510 --> 04:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
Advantage think about that that is the
 
04:04:00.070 --> 04:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
biggest that is that is we're going to
 
04:04:01.389 --> 04:04:01.399 align:start position:0%
talk out of both sides of our mouth
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to say that we want an
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
independent partisan redistricting but
 
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
then again we're going to take money
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
from public employees and use it to
 
04:04:14.349 --> 04:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
Lobby against whatever bill s that they
 
04:04:16.510 --> 04:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
find and usually are against
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
conservatives in the state there's a
 
04:04:21.790 --> 04:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
whole slew of other things they support
 
04:04:23.550 --> 04:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
legislation amending Motor Vehicle
 
04:04:25.309 --> 04:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
Registration enforcement laws to ensure
 
04:04:26.670 --> 04:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
collection of all state and local
 
04:04:28.510 --> 04:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
registration fees owned by New Hampshire
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
residents they support legislation that
 
04:04:33.910 --> 04:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
um protects and preserves local natural
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
resources which is great in public
 
04:04:38.070 --> 04:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure builds Community
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
resilience um but then they also adopt
 
04:04:43.229 --> 04:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
into a climate change and they mitigate
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
risks those are the risks that they set
 
04:04:48.030 --> 04:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
can can I stop you there for a second
 
04:04:50.950 --> 04:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
can we talk about um what how this bill
 
04:04:54.550 --> 04:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
works and how that would how it um
 
04:04:57.550 --> 04:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
accomplishes your the goals of the bill
 
04:05:01.550 --> 04:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
okay um so it's fairly simple it
 
04:05:04.710 --> 04:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
basically takes the the piece the carve
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
out which is the legislative piece um
 
04:05:09.309 --> 04:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
and there's many there's you know we're
 
04:05:11.149 --> 04:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
talking about other associations whether
 
04:05:13.830 --> 04:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
it be Schoolboard associations um all
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
that it carves out the piece which is
 
04:05:19.389 --> 04:05:19.399 align:start position:0%
the lobbying entity of the organizations
 
04:05:22.870 --> 04:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
so the bill basically stops that so
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of emails that I've
 
04:05:29.790 --> 04:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
received from um public employees uh you
 
04:05:32.750 --> 04:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
know other estate reps and you know oh
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
they're concerned that they won't be
 
04:05:36.790 --> 04:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
able to get this advice or any that's it
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything about that it
 
04:05:41.670 --> 04:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
basically stops the piece that really in
 
04:05:43.950 --> 04:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
a sense is unconstitutional
 
04:05:47.830 --> 04:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
and should be illegal so why would I
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
would never my taxes shouldn't be paying
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist to go against
 
04:05:55.950 --> 04:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that is from the government
 
04:05:57.309 --> 04:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
it it's the government against the
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
government it's just it doesn't make any
 
04:06:01.830 --> 04:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
sense and so this bill does that
 
04:06:03.950 --> 04:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
specifically it doesn't touch any
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
aspects of any of these associations and
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
literally probably a lot of wonderful
 
04:06:11.269 --> 04:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
things that they're doing um there was a
 
04:06:13.269 --> 04:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
member when I was a you know last year
 
04:06:15.269 --> 04:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
when was my or last term when I was a
 
04:06:18.229 --> 04:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
first year rep and I used um some of the
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful resources that they had and
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
asked um for their expertise in history
 
04:06:25.630 --> 04:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
and things like that with legislation so
 
04:06:28.070 --> 04:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
that type of stuff is is great and they
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
should be providing those trainings and
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
um they also do um events and a lot of
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
those types of things that's all great
 
04:06:38.710 --> 04:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to Orange badge
 
04:06:41.309 --> 04:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
lobbying for or against legislation on
 
04:06:44.110 --> 04:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers dime no
 
04:06:46.870 --> 04:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill does thank you
 
04:06:49.070 --> 04:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh you'll take questions I assume sure
 
04:06:52.630 --> 04:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
by uh representa W thank you very much
 
04:06:54.309 --> 04:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you very much for
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
coming in today represent fenza um I
 
04:07:00.229 --> 04:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
live in a very small town and it's my
 
04:07:03.389 --> 04:07:03.399 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh the municipal
 
04:07:05.550 --> 04:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
Association charges different towns
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
based on population to belong my town
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
does um we do pay of course towards
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
lobbying we couldn't afford to pay for a
 
04:07:18.189 --> 04:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
lobbyist to come in and Lobby on certain
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
issues and I do know at one time I'm a
 
04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
former selectman we would receive
 
04:07:24.510 --> 04:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
notices from the municipal Association
 
04:07:27.229 --> 04:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
as to what issues they were covering and
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
we could say whether or not we supported
 
04:07:31.870 --> 04:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
them um I can you tell me what the
 
04:07:33.710 --> 04:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
problem is with that maybe the general
 
04:07:36.550 --> 04:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
citizen doesn't know about us paying his
 
04:07:39.550 --> 04:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
in all these communities paying into the
 
04:07:41.630 --> 04:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
municipal Municipal
 
04:07:45.189 --> 04:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
Association but Our Town fathers and
 
04:07:48.550 --> 04:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
mothers are managing how the money is
 
04:07:50.910 --> 04:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
spent when we do become members and we
 
04:07:53.830 --> 04:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
do have a voice in that do you agree
 
04:07:55.189 --> 04:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
that that's a
 
04:07:58.590 --> 04:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
problem the problem is where you just
 
04:08:02.189 --> 04:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
said um that you have government
 
04:08:07.830 --> 04:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
employees that are paying to lobby for
 
04:08:07.840 --> 04:08:09.750 align:start position:0%
employees that are paying to lobby for
legislation

04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I get paid $100 a year for this job I
 
04:08:17.309 --> 04:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
do all of my own work I don't I'm not
 
04:08:20.830 --> 04:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
asking I I don't gosh I'd love somebody
 
04:08:22.910 --> 04:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
to lobby for me in all of the
 
04:08:25.590 --> 04:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that I want to pass but it's
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
wrong so if you're talking about advice
 
04:08:31.590 --> 04:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
or any of those types of things that's
 
04:08:33.990 --> 04:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
fine but if you're paying someone and
 
04:08:35.710 --> 04:08:35.720 align:start position:0%
you're a you're Public Employee you're a
 
04:08:37.550 --> 04:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
government employee or an elected
 
04:08:40.910 --> 04:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
official that's doing that to another
 
04:08:44.429 --> 04:08:44.439 align:start position:0%
entity that is then coming in here
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's you're using taxpayer funds to do
 
04:08:51.469 --> 04:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
that and you can't it's one uh it's
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional to do that nobody gave
 
04:08:55.910 --> 04:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
you consent to do
 
04:08:58.710 --> 04:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
that follow up follow up thank you very
 
04:09:03.790 --> 04:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your response um that
 
04:09:06.550 --> 04:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
our town pays about $200 a year to be a
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
member so the impact on taxpayers is
 
04:09:12.429 --> 04:09:12.439 align:start position:0%
minimal um should we withdraw from the
 
04:09:14.229 --> 04:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
municipal Association for all the good
 
04:09:16.950 --> 04:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
that they do based on the fact that it's
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
pennies per dollar that anyone pays and
 
04:09:21.109 --> 04:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
I think it's probably that way with most
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
communities what do you think no I don't
 
04:09:25.349 --> 04:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
think that you should withdraw at all I
 
04:09:27.830 --> 04:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
think that you should utilize all of
 
04:09:32.469 --> 04:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
their wonderful Services um and if they
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
want to have a separate funding arm that
 
04:09:39.469 --> 04:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
is nothing to do that that's what I mean
 
04:09:42.870 --> 04:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
it has to be separate I don't care if
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's $22,000 or a dollar and there are
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
fees that are a lot higher of course
 
04:09:52.830 --> 04:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
with you know larger locations um they
 
04:09:55.469 --> 04:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
do a lot of great things it's just it
 
04:09:58.389 --> 04:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
needs to be carved out
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
specifically prep payer thank you Mr
 
04:10:04.950 --> 04:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
chair so last year we've we've seen this
 
04:10:09.550 --> 04:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
bill before HB 1479 last year um a lot
 
04:10:11.349 --> 04:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
of the testimony we received you
 
04:10:13.030 --> 04:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned about a list of certain bills
 
04:10:14.469 --> 04:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
by certain members of the committee that
 
04:10:16.870 --> 04:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
were opposed by New Hampshire Municipal
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
Association as an example so we have a
 
04:10:21.630 --> 04:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
list of towns that are actually quite
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
conservative leaning that have submitted
 
04:10:26.109 --> 04:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
opposition to your bill in Auburn
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
Allenstown Bedford Dairy gtown Hillsboro
 
04:10:32.389 --> 04:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
londonairy plasto Salem so how do you
 
04:10:34.710 --> 04:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
reconcile that why do you spoke I mean
 
04:10:36.790 --> 04:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
the towns are pretty clear that they
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
rely on this resource um what is the
 
04:10:40.640 --> 04:10:43.510 align:start position:0%
rely on this resource um what is the
conflict

04:10:43.510 --> 04:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
04:10:45.670 --> 04:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
so you just you just basically said that
 
04:10:48.510 --> 04:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
you just heard from government employees
 
04:10:51.309 --> 04:10:51.319 align:start position:0%
that want to continue to have taxpayer
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
funded lobbying efforts that answers the
 
04:10:57.630 --> 04:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
question I don't care if they are have
 
04:11:00.109 --> 04:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
conservative reps that represent them it
 
04:11:03.030 --> 04:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't matter it's a conflict
 
04:11:05.670 --> 04:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's unconstitutional and it needs to
 
04:11:08.750 --> 04:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
stop it's basically I I gave a lot of
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
examples and I can give a lot more I
 
04:11:12.189 --> 04:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
have a lot more testimony but I won't go
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
there but
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying you're you're basically
 
04:11:20.149 --> 04:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
arguing for them to have access to
 
04:11:21.429 --> 04:11:21.439 align:start position:0%
something that they shouldn't have
 
04:11:24.030 --> 04:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
access to if any of these public
 
04:11:26.750 --> 04:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
employees want to do the work and all of
 
04:11:28.750 --> 04:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff on their own and on
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
their own dime that's fine just like
 
04:11:35.189 --> 04:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
every other taxpaying taxpaying citizen
 
04:11:35.199 --> 04:11:36.710 align:start position:0%
every other taxpaying taxpaying citizen
would

04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:11:39.750 --> 04:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
do can you be you you keep saying
 
04:11:41.910 --> 04:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional repeatedly what
 
04:11:44.349 --> 04:11:44.359 align:start position:0%
specific la part of the Constitution
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
that do you perceive that this prohibits
 
04:11:49.389 --> 04:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
Free Speech it's
 
04:11:51.550 --> 04:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
I article
 
04:11:55.070 --> 04:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
one the first amendment how does that
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
how does that prohibit Free Speech
 
04:11:59.550 --> 04:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
because it is consel it's compelled
 
04:11:59.560 --> 04:12:01.670 align:start position:0%
because it is consel it's compelled
speech

04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
speech
 
04:12:04.030 --> 04:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
so to be
 
04:12:06.550 --> 04:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
specific cons compelled speech is when
 
04:12:08.670 --> 04:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
the government forces someone to say or
 
04:12:10.710 --> 04:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
do something that they don't want to do
 
04:12:13.550 --> 04:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
so because it's government
 
04:12:16.590 --> 04:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
employees public employees that are
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
basically lobbying for whatever they
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
want they're basically deciding on their
 
04:12:25.750 --> 04:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
own versus their constituents it's not
 
04:12:28.229 --> 04:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
like they are representing a board of
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
Selectmen is you know for a town of
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
4,000 they're not going to those 4,000
 
04:12:35.070 --> 04:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
people to say hey we're you know we're
 
04:12:36.630 --> 04:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
contacting the New Hampshire Municipal
 
04:12:38.870 --> 04:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
Association because you know we really
 
04:12:40.830 --> 04:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
don't like that bill so we want all of
 
04:12:42.510 --> 04:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
you guys to be on board that's not how
 
04:12:43.710 --> 04:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
it's working
 
04:12:45.870 --> 04:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
you're having a group of people that are
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
decision okay so it when you're saying
 
04:12:55.269 --> 04:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
that it sounds like it's cutting off the
 
04:12:57.229 --> 04:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
knees of people who are elected to run
 
04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
towns and cities to make decisions
 
04:13:01.309 --> 04:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
they're these associations make
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations they're not saying you
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
have to do this they're providing
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
information so this in my opinion is
 
04:13:10.309 --> 04:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
trying to suppress information to cities
 
04:13:13.349 --> 04:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
and towns to get more information about
 
04:13:14.630 --> 04:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
these things because obviously cities
 
04:13:16.030 --> 04:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
and towns don't have the time and the
 
04:13:18.429 --> 04:13:18.439 align:start position:0%
resources and the attorneys to di Deep
 
04:13:21.910 --> 04:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
dive into all of these bills so I don't
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
think my Selectmen are you know if I had
 
04:13:27.269 --> 04:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
a real problem with it I would bring It
 
04:13:29.349 --> 04:13:29.359 align:start position:0%
Forward at my town meeting and say hey I
 
04:13:30.830 --> 04:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't want my town spending money on
 
04:13:32.229 --> 04:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
this and then we could do a warrant or
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
whatever I I yes because they were
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
talking about free speech and I don't
 
04:13:40.510 --> 04:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
feel like any of this I feel if anything
 
04:13:44.630 --> 04:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
no question it's not do you agree no I
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
don't agree because it's not suppressing
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
free speech for one you just said they
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
don't have the time so so a a a
 
04:14:00.910 --> 04:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
selectman doesn't have the time but you
 
04:14:03.790 --> 04:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
know the father of of six that is
 
04:14:05.870 --> 04:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
working two jobs or whatever to he I'm
 
04:14:08.349 --> 04:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
sure he doesn't have the time either so
 
04:14:11.189 --> 04:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't you're gaming the system
 
04:14:13.389 --> 04:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
if it comes to all of the stuff that I
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
talked about the using them as a
 
04:14:18.349 --> 04:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
resource information training Legal
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
Services all fine and dandy but when you
 
04:14:24.429 --> 04:14:24.439 align:start position:0%
are utilizing the
 
04:14:27.550 --> 04:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
government the government's utilizing um
 
04:14:30.229 --> 04:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
the government to lobby for itself it's
 
04:14:32.670 --> 04:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
illegal that it shouldn't be done you're
 
04:14:34.590 --> 04:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
using it on taxpayer you're funding it
 
04:14:36.269 --> 04:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
with taxpayer
 
04:14:40.389 --> 04:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.990 --> 04:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
God so I'm sorry last one so tied into
 
04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
that would this be perceived as illegal
 
04:14:48.389 --> 04:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
in your opinion in the house calendar on
 
04:14:52.109 --> 04:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
December 20th there was a notice by to
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
attend for representatives to attend an
 
04:14:56.670 --> 04:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
Alec New Hampshire meeting at the upm
 
04:14:59.590 --> 04:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
Walker house would that be an illegal a
 
04:15:02.630 --> 04:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
notice using a public building funded by
 
04:15:04.830 --> 04:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
tax dollar maintenance a calendar that
 
04:15:07.950 --> 04:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
is used public money to create is that
 
04:15:11.950 --> 04:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:14.469 --> 04:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
bill this doesn't have anything to do
 
04:15:17.309 --> 04:15:17.319 align:start position:0%
with um that and I don't even know what
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
Alec is so I can't really speak to that
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
a notice is not is not lobbying Alec is
 
04:15:25.870 --> 04:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
a lobbying organization okay well are
 
04:15:27.429 --> 04:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
they lobbying a bill were they lobbying
 
04:15:29.910 --> 04:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
a bill were they here testifying
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:47.429 --> 04:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so we've talked a
 
04:15:50.189 --> 04:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
lot about the municipal side of things
 
04:15:51.830 --> 04:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to understand in
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
section one paragraph two it says no
 
04:15:57.109 --> 04:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
public funds shall be used to Lobby
 
04:15:59.429 --> 04:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
attempt to influence legislation
 
04:16:01.910 --> 04:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
participate in political activity or
 
04:16:03.990 --> 04:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
contribute funds to any entity for the
 
04:16:05.790 --> 04:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
purpose of engaging in the same I'm just
 
04:16:07.349 --> 04:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the scope of that
 
04:16:09.030 --> 04:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot about lobbying
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
specifically but what would you consider
 
04:16:14.910 --> 04:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
to be prevented under attempt to
 
04:16:16.710 --> 04:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
influence legislation would that also
 
04:16:19.109 --> 04:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
include things like public testimony
 
04:16:21.109 --> 04:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
from a state
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
employee no it wouldn't include public
 
04:16:25.830 --> 04:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
testimony from a state employee it would
 
04:16:29.710 --> 04:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
it basically if you are a Lobby lobbyist
 
04:16:32.750 --> 04:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
you have your orange badge and you are
 
04:16:36.990 --> 04:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
recognized through that one and if so
 
04:16:38.950 --> 04:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
for example there's a lot of other ways
 
04:16:41.349 --> 04:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
where social media posts all that kind
 
04:16:44.189 --> 04:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
of stuff from let's say an association
 
04:16:47.030 --> 04:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
or whatever that is pushing for um
 
04:16:49.189 --> 04:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
certain legislation getting people out
 
04:16:51.750 --> 04:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
to go against all of that kind of stuff
 
04:16:54.510 --> 04:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:57.229 --> 04:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
that thank you very
 
04:17:00.149 --> 04:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your testimony uh
 
04:17:05.950 --> 04:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:09.070 --> 04:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
Banfield welcome to legislative
 
04:17:11.229 --> 04:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
Administration not sure you've ever been
 
04:17:16.349 --> 04:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:18.990 --> 04:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh my name is Amry Banfield for the
 
04:17:21.149 --> 04:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
record I'm a parental rights Advocate
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
focused on academic excellence and
 
04:17:26.269 --> 04:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
education so normally I'm in their
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee so uh I come here in support
 
04:17:32.590 --> 04:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
of this legislation uh mainly because
 
04:17:34.389 --> 04:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
everything well everything she said I
 
04:17:36.550 --> 04:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
would I would agree with parents have no
 
04:17:39.309 --> 04:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
idea that they're paying for lobbyists
 
04:17:42.109 --> 04:17:42.119 align:start position:0%
to Lobby on their behalf as the school
 
04:17:43.630 --> 04:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
board's administrator ation or the
 
04:17:45.229 --> 04:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
school administrators
 
04:17:47.229 --> 04:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
Association and then when they come to
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
find out uh most people are pretty angry
 
04:17:52.550 --> 04:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
most people don't like that uh why are
 
04:17:54.510 --> 04:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
they using my tax dollars out of my
 
04:17:57.070 --> 04:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
school budget where the school's telling
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
us we need more money and in my time
 
04:18:02.710 --> 04:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
we're paying $39,000 per student why are
 
04:18:06.389 --> 04:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
we paying for lobbyists on top of this
 
04:18:08.309 --> 04:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
um especially since the teachers are
 
04:18:09.910 --> 04:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
putting into a fund and the teachers are
 
04:18:12.149 --> 04:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
paying for their own lobbyists so I do
 
04:18:14.109 --> 04:18:14.119 align:start position:0%
Lobby on have of parents and I don't
 
04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
wear an orange tag because for 20 years
 
04:18:18.590 --> 04:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
I've done this and I've accepted a
 
04:18:18.600 --> 04:18:20.830 align:start position:0%
I've done this and I've accepted a
dime

04:18:20.830 --> 04:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
dime
 
04:18:24.429 --> 04:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
um they do not represent me and I I'm
 
04:18:26.790 --> 04:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
going to mainly speak to the lobbyists
 
04:18:28.070 --> 04:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
that Lobby on behalf of the school
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
boards of the school school
 
04:18:31.870 --> 04:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
administrators because that's that's who
 
04:18:34.710 --> 04:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
will be coming up here um they don't
 
04:18:36.750 --> 04:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
represent me but yet I have to pay their
 
04:18:39.149 --> 04:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
salaries and a lot of times their
 
04:18:41.429 --> 04:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
lobbying efforts go against everything
 
04:18:43.670 --> 04:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
that I believe in or think that is
 
04:18:45.950 --> 04:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
actually good for the school and I can
 
04:18:47.830 --> 04:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
give you a couple examples the school
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
administrators Association there was a
 
04:18:52.830 --> 04:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
bill in the house I think by uh
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and we had we
 
04:18:57.229 --> 04:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
looked at the bill and and
 
04:19:00.590 --> 04:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
um it was to address some of the
 
04:19:02.710 --> 04:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
pornographic and obscene books that were
 
04:19:05.550 --> 04:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
given to children on their Chromebooks
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
through the school library online school
 
04:19:09.990 --> 04:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
library and we had one person a parent
 
04:19:11.750 --> 04:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
come in and talk about she was a sex
 
04:19:14.510 --> 04:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
offender therapist talk about how the
 
04:19:18.149 --> 04:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
books hyperlink to dating sites where
 
04:19:20.910 --> 04:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
pedophiles can actually meet up with
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
children and so this is the kind of
 
04:19:26.590 --> 04:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
lobbying sometimes that goes on they
 
04:19:28.710 --> 04:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
didn't want to stop something like that
 
04:19:30.670 --> 04:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
the school administrators Association
 
04:19:32.309 --> 04:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
the parent did the parent came in there
 
04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
was not funded you know just came to
 
04:19:37.670 --> 04:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
represent herself but that's the kind of
 
04:19:39.910 --> 04:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
conflict that happens with these
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
organizations they're not representing
 
04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
parents lot of times but yet the parents
 
04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
are forced to pay
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
them um another thing I thought of
 
04:19:50.309 --> 04:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
because I know that this has come before
 
04:19:51.910 --> 04:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
your Committee in the
 
04:19:55.550 --> 04:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
past and representative Penza had talked
 
04:19:58.670 --> 04:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
about compelled speech if this is not
 
04:20:02.189 --> 04:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
acceptable if you are not willing to
 
04:20:05.309 --> 04:20:05.319 align:start position:0%
restrict this kind of activity then it
 
04:20:08.149 --> 04:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
should be all activity I haven't P been
 
04:20:09.630 --> 04:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
paid for 20 years and yet I've
 
04:20:13.790 --> 04:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
represented parents every year in
 
04:20:17.349 --> 04:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
conquered so why don't we just take the
 
04:20:18.870 --> 04:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
money that the school is spending
 
04:20:20.990 --> 04:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
because now it's budget neutral put it
 
04:20:25.389 --> 04:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
into a a a trust fund and then let other
 
04:20:27.550 --> 04:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
people with different viewpoints start
 
04:20:29.950 --> 04:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
taking money out and and start paying
 
04:20:32.070 --> 04:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
anybody who has a different Viewpoint
 
04:20:35.630 --> 04:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
why is it just limited viewpoints that
 
04:20:38.429 --> 04:20:38.439 align:start position:0%
get the taxpayer money that's that's the
 
04:20:40.710 --> 04:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
other thing so I'm looking at possibly
 
04:20:42.309 --> 04:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
maybe an amendment maybe you guys can
 
04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
come with an up with Amendment if this
 
04:20:45.710 --> 04:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
isn't acceptable to the committee
 
04:20:47.070 --> 04:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
because I think it's acceptable I think
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
it should just be done away with I think
 
04:20:52.030 --> 04:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
you know schools need money and yet
 
04:20:53.950 --> 04:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
they're throwing money out the out the
 
04:20:57.109 --> 04:20:57.119 align:start position:0%
door for this stuff um why not come up
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
with an amendment and I'm working on
 
04:21:01.870 --> 04:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
language with an attorney right now that
 
04:21:04.710 --> 04:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
you throw it all into a pot trust fund
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
and then let other people with different
 
04:21:08.870 --> 04:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
viewpoints take out and and they are
 
04:21:11.710 --> 04:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
able to Lobby on behalf of parents and
 
04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
students special needs we have special
 
04:21:16.030 --> 04:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
needs people who come here all the time
 
04:21:20.070 --> 04:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
they're not paid a dime and so you know
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
why why is it just restricted to some
 
04:21:24.309 --> 04:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
viewpoints I guess and and so that might
 
04:21:27.870 --> 04:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
be an alternative to the to this bill um
 
04:21:29.590 --> 04:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
I think that's basically what I wanted
 
04:21:32.349 --> 04:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
to say uh school board's administration
 
04:21:34.830 --> 04:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
had put out a model policy years ago
 
04:21:37.870 --> 04:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
they withdrew it but it it had a
 
04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
provision in it where information was to
 
04:21:43.070 --> 04:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
be hidden from parents
 
04:21:46.109 --> 04:21:46.119 align:start position:0%
parents don't want this a lot of parents
 
04:21:47.189 --> 04:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
don't want that I'm certainly not
 
04:21:48.790 --> 04:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
speaking for everybody but a lot of
 
04:21:50.189 --> 04:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
parents don't want that and yet they're
 
04:21:52.510 --> 04:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
paying for that so that's those are the
 
04:21:55.510 --> 04:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
situations that I've seen for 20 years
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
and something's got to be done I mean
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
because to me when parents find out that
 
04:22:01.710 --> 04:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
this is going on they're not very happy
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
about it so that's all I wanted to bring
 
04:22:07.109 --> 04:22:07.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for your testony
 
04:22:10.030 --> 04:22:10.040 align:start position:0%

04:22:20.550 --> 04:22:20.560 align:start position:0%

call E glasses um Margaret burns from
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%

04:22:33.389 --> 04:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you good afternoon members of
 
04:22:35.309 --> 04:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
the legislative Administration committee
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
my name is Margaret Burns I'm the
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
04:22:41.389 --> 04:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association I'm here in
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill
 
04:22:45.389 --> 04:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
I've been executive director for seven
 
04:22:47.590 --> 04:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
years now and each one of those seven
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
years we've seen a bill like this almost
 
04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
each one of those seven years we've seen
 
04:22:53.950 --> 04:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
a bill like this and as was referenced
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
earlier House Bill 1479 which was
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
substantially similar to this bill was
 
04:23:00.870 --> 04:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
inde definitely postponed there's often
 
04:23:03.990 --> 04:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of mixed information about what
 
04:23:05.950 --> 04:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
these bills do and there was certainly a
 
04:23:07.710 --> 04:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
lot of mixed information about what last
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
year's Bill did as well as what this
 
04:23:12.510 --> 04:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
year's House Bill 314 does so I'd like
 
04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
to break it down what the impacts are of
 
04:23:16.870 --> 04:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
the actual bill as
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
written the bill prohibits a wide range
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
of individuals from speech related
 
04:23:26.149 --> 04:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
activity in relation to the legislative
 
04:23:28.870 --> 04:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
process it's sort of broken down into
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
two different
 
04:23:32.950 --> 04:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
prohibitions the first two paragraphs
 
04:23:35.309 --> 04:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
paragraph one and paragraph two are
 
04:23:38.189 --> 04:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
extremely broad by adding the term
 
04:23:41.229 --> 04:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
public funds into RSA chapter 15 and
 
04:23:43.149 --> 04:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
defining it as any Grant or
 
04:23:46.109 --> 04:23:46.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation of the state or any local
 
04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
government and then Banning in the
 
04:23:51.630 --> 04:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
second paragraph that any public funds
 
04:23:54.030 --> 04:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
can be used to Lobby attempt to
 
04:23:57.030 --> 04:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
influence legislation or participate in
 
04:23:59.630 --> 04:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
political activity there's essentially a
 
04:24:02.990 --> 04:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
complete ban on any form of speech that
 
04:24:06.990 --> 04:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
is in any way funded by public funds
 
04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
this is because an appropriation of
 
04:24:11.309 --> 04:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
public funds is simply that it can be
 
04:24:13.870 --> 04:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
someone's salary it can be mileage to
 
04:24:16.429 --> 04:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
travel somewhere it can be the phone or
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
the computer that's used a public funds
 
04:24:20.790 --> 04:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation is simply money
 
04:24:22.590 --> 04:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the state or local
 
04:24:25.070 --> 04:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
government for a particular purpose so
 
04:24:26.990 --> 04:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
adding in this new definition of public
 
04:24:29.550 --> 04:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
funds and coupling that with the
 
04:24:32.070 --> 04:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
prohibition in paragraph two that no
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
public funds can be used for these
 
04:24:36.830 --> 04:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
purposes is going to impact not only
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
organizations that Lobby and and people
 
04:24:41.630 --> 04:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
who register as lobbyist but much
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
broader than that it's going to affect
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
all local officials as well as anyone
 
04:24:48.910 --> 04:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
Who's acting in any capacity that's
 
04:24:51.630 --> 04:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
funded by a grant or appropriation of
 
04:24:53.710 --> 04:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
the state or local government and so
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
that's why paragraph 1 and two are Broad
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
and they don't just relate to lobbyists
 
04:24:59.870 --> 04:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
and they don't even just relate to
 
04:25:02.750 --> 04:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
lobbying activity because while lobbying
 
04:25:05.870 --> 04:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
at least has some type of definition in
 
04:25:09.510 --> 04:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
RSA chapter 15 the additional terms
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
attempt to influence legislation or
 
04:25:14.269 --> 04:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
partic participate in political activity
 
04:25:16.910 --> 04:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
are incredibly broad so at worst these
 
04:25:19.229 --> 04:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
create complete banss on speech related
 
04:25:22.030 --> 04:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
to legislation and at best they create
 
04:25:24.189 --> 04:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
Mass confusion about what speech is
 
04:25:26.309 --> 04:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
allowed which will have the effect of
 
04:25:28.269 --> 04:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
chilling speech in this
 
04:25:31.070 --> 04:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
legislature and for that reason although
 
04:25:33.229 --> 04:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
most of the testimony introducing the
 
04:25:35.349 --> 04:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
bill was focused on the New Hampshire
 
04:25:37.990 --> 04:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and on local
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
governments there is a very wide range
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
of groups and individ ual who are
 
04:25:45.630 --> 04:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill 314 some of them
 
04:25:47.469 --> 04:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
who you might have heard from already
 
04:25:48.790 --> 04:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
this includes the New Hampshire for
 
04:25:50.590 --> 04:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
Center Center for nonprofits the New
 
04:25:52.469 --> 04:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charitable Foundation
 
04:25:54.189 --> 04:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
Association of Cy School boards
 
04:25:55.710 --> 04:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
Association of assessing officials
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
Health officers associations Public
 
04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
Works Public Works Mutual Aid police
 
04:26:03.950 --> 04:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
Chiefs Fire Chiefs and so on paragraph
 
04:26:07.070 --> 04:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
three is really a separate prohibition
 
04:26:09.550 --> 04:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
from paragraphs one and two paragraph
 
04:26:12.990 --> 04:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
three is focused specifically on believe
 
04:26:15.109 --> 04:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
organizations that are recipients of
 
04:26:17.109 --> 04:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
public funds and has a separate
 
04:26:19.389 --> 04:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
requirement that those organizations
 
04:26:22.149 --> 04:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
have to segregate funds so I believe I
 
04:26:24.269 --> 04:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
heard when the prime sponsor introduced
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
the bill that this bill is prohibiting
 
04:26:29.990 --> 04:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
lobbying activity because it is
 
04:26:32.429 --> 04:26:32.439 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional speech but in fact
 
04:26:34.710 --> 04:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph one and two are broadly
 
04:26:37.309 --> 04:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
prohibiting in general local officials
 
04:26:38.910 --> 04:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
and others who are funded by public
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
speech from speaking and being part of
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
the legislative process process and then
 
04:26:45.469 --> 04:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
paragraph three is creating some sort of
 
04:26:47.790 --> 04:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
separate requirement for segregation of
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
funds by certain organizations
 
04:26:52.189 --> 04:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
specifically those that are required to
 
04:26:55.830 --> 04:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
register under RSA chapter 151 so two
 
04:26:58.030 --> 04:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
separate prohibitions that are both very
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
Broad in their
 
04:27:03.030 --> 04:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
effect and of course the bill goes on to
 
04:27:04.790 --> 04:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
make these activities a Class A
 
04:27:06.990 --> 04:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor there's personal liability
 
04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
that is equal to three times the amount
 
04:27:12.429 --> 04:27:12.439 align:start position:0%
of money um improperly used um and any
 
04:27:14.309 --> 04:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
person in the state has the ability to
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
bring that lawsuit whether they can show
 
04:27:17.870 --> 04:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
direct harm or not or whether they're
 
04:27:19.870 --> 04:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
directly connected or not they would
 
04:27:22.269 --> 04:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
have the ability to bring the
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuit what this bill really is doing
 
04:27:29.229 --> 04:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
is it's creating a Broadband on speech
 
04:27:32.109 --> 04:27:32.119 align:start position:0%
and it is also at the same time going to
 
04:27:34.750 --> 04:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
create a serious chilling effect on what
 
04:27:38.950 --> 04:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.550 --> 04:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
speech nh's lobbying is very public and
 
04:27:47.309 --> 04:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
as you saw in or as you heard about in
 
04:27:49.349 --> 04:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
the introduction of the bill all the
 
04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
bills that we take positions on are
 
04:27:53.070 --> 04:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
posted on our website we are very
 
04:27:55.269 --> 04:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
transparent about what we do and how we
 
04:27:58.229 --> 04:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
do it and in the past we have heard with
 
04:28:00.510 --> 04:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
respect to this bill that much of the
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
support for bills like this is because
 
04:28:05.030 --> 04:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
people don't agree with the positions
 
04:28:07.349 --> 04:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
that we take here in the legislature and
 
04:28:09.149 --> 04:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
that we would they would prefer that we
 
04:28:12.149 --> 04:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
don't take them what disturbs me most
 
04:28:14.590 --> 04:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
post about the information around this
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill is that our positions that we take
 
04:28:20.349 --> 04:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
on legislation should somehow have an
 
04:28:23.070 --> 04:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
effect on whether or not municipalities
 
04:28:25.429 --> 04:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
local officials and other individuals
 
04:28:27.030 --> 04:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
who wish to speak and engage in the
 
04:28:29.149 --> 04:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
legislative process should be banned
 
04:28:32.109 --> 04:28:32.119 align:start position:0%
from doing so nhma is a nonprofit
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan organization our positions
 
04:28:37.229 --> 04:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
are solely based on what our members
 
04:28:39.229 --> 04:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
vote on through our legislative policy
 
04:28:41.670 --> 04:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
process every two years we do not take
 
04:28:44.309 --> 04:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
into account party we do not take into
 
04:28:46.630 --> 04:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
account anything except how the bills
 
04:28:49.469 --> 04:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
impact local government we have heard
 
04:28:52.189 --> 04:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
many times on this bill that part of the
 
04:28:54.790 --> 04:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
problem allegedly is that the advocacy
 
04:28:57.149 --> 04:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
we do is somehow not in the interest of
 
04:28:59.670 --> 04:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taxpayers and I wish to
 
04:29:03.389 --> 04:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
tell you that that is patently false
 
04:29:05.710 --> 04:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
most of the bills that nhma takes
 
04:29:08.590 --> 04:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
positions on do one of two things they
 
04:29:11.189 --> 04:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
cost taxpayers more money and they take
 
04:29:14.070 --> 04:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
away voter Authority at the local level
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
by taking away local control while it
 
04:29:18.630 --> 04:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
may or may not be true that individuals
 
04:29:20.429 --> 04:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
across the state understand that there's
 
04:29:22.510 --> 04:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
advocacy happening on the behalf of
 
04:29:24.590 --> 04:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
local governments the majority of the
 
04:29:26.510 --> 04:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
bills that we're involved with would
 
04:29:28.630 --> 04:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
cost taxpayers money or would affect
 
04:29:30.510 --> 04:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
their ability to vote and make decisions
 
04:29:33.309 --> 04:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
at the local level and while this bill
 
04:29:36.269 --> 04:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
on its face is not about that the speech
 
04:29:39.269 --> 04:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
that it would ban as a result is serious
 
04:29:40.950 --> 04:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
and would have seriously detrimental
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
effects on the train transparency and
 
04:29:45.109 --> 04:29:45.119 align:start position:0%
access to the legislative process that
 
04:29:47.349 --> 04:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
you all engage in so I urge you to vote
 
04:29:49.590 --> 04:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
this bill as in expedient to legislate I
 
04:29:51.309 --> 04:29:51.319 align:start position:0%
apologize if I was more than five
 
04:29:55.710 --> 04:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
minutes it's all right we'll bill you
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
um would you take questions of
 
04:30:01.710 --> 04:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
course short ones right look at the
 
04:30:05.309 --> 04:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
clock um representative payer thank
 
04:30:07.510 --> 04:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman can you tell me um
 
04:30:09.189 --> 04:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
just out of my own personal curiosity
 
04:30:11.269 --> 04:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
what is your background do you have a
 
04:30:13.750 --> 04:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
legal background yes I'm a yes I'm a
 
04:30:15.309 --> 04:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
lawyer and before I was executive
 
04:30:16.990 --> 04:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
director of the municipal Association I
 
04:30:19.109 --> 04:30:19.119 align:start position:0%
was staff attorney there for several
 
04:30:22.109 --> 04:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
years you have a you have a follow oh
 
04:30:24.149 --> 04:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
follow I'm sorry you have some
 
04:30:25.750 --> 04:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
familiarity with the
 
04:30:28.630 --> 04:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
law I ask one more follow question last
 
04:30:31.870 --> 04:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
one okay so from what you were talking
 
04:30:33.550 --> 04:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
about that this would be a ban on speech
 
04:30:35.950 --> 04:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
and whatnot in your legal opinion is
 
04:30:38.590 --> 04:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
this a violation of the First Amendment
 
04:30:40.670 --> 04:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
um lobbying is protected

314 was has been introduced in several
 
04:32:16.950 --> 04:32:16.960 align:start position:0%

of this um o over the past four or five
 
04:32:26.950 --> 04:32:26.960 align:start position:0%

uh the Committees have recommended itl
 
04:32:30.830 --> 04:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
and uh I believe that was for good
 
04:32:33.550 --> 04:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
reason the term lobbyist in
 
04:32:37.109 --> 04:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
rsa5 uh colum one has a very broad
 
04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
definition and combined with a past uh
 
04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
State's Attorney General's office
 
04:32:43.309 --> 04:32:43.319 align:start position:0%

04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
here by the the Committees to speak on
 
04:32:56.229 --> 04:32:56.239 align:start position:0%

04:33:14.230 --> 04:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
within the annual budgets of those of
 
04:33:17.709 --> 04:33:17.719 align:start position:0%
the communities that the voters review
 
04:33:19.990 --> 04:33:20.000 align:start position:0%

meeting deliberative session or through
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
town or city councils there is a
 
04:33:27.150 --> 04:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
transparent and public process already
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
to approve these funds in each Community
 
04:33:31.949 --> 04:33:31.959 align:start position:0%

04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
our members by providing input to
 
04:33:38.670 --> 04:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
legislators on bills that may have a
 
04:33:40.869 --> 04:33:40.879 align:start position:0%

legislators to provide input for from
 
04:33:54.269 --> 04:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
our members relative to legislation
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
specific to our areas of expertise many
 
04:33:59.390 --> 04:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
smaller communities do not have the
 
04:34:02.629 --> 04:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
staff or resources to have their voice
 
04:34:05.150 --> 04:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
heard and conquered those communities
 
04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
rely on the many professional
 
04:34:09.629 --> 04:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
associations to speak on their behalf on
 
04:34:11.910 --> 04:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
matters of great importance the many
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
professional associations do not receive
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
funding specifically for lobbying nor do
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
they intend to Lobby however again
 
04:34:21.189 --> 04:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
because of the broad definition we get
 
04:34:22.949 --> 04:34:22.959 align:start position:0%
rolled into that and especially with
 
04:34:22.959 --> 04:34:24.470 align:start position:0%
rolled into that and especially with
this

04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
bill how will House Bill 314 impact the
 
04:34:29.910 --> 04:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
minicipal employee who wishes to educate
 
04:34:32.869 --> 04:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
legislators on the merits of legislation
 
04:34:35.029 --> 04:34:35.039 align:start position:0%
will this legislation prohibit those
 
04:34:37.269 --> 04:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
conversations unless discussion time and
 
04:34:39.990 --> 04:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
funding is tracked this proposed
 
04:34:42.551 --> 04:34:42.561 align:start position:0%
legislation could limit or even prohibit
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
free discussion and free speech of
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal Employees with their
 
04:34:51.189 --> 04:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
legislators House Bill 314 while it is
 
04:34:52.990 --> 04:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
well intended to Target specific
 
04:34:55.789 --> 04:34:55.799 align:start position:0%
lobbying expenditures or groups and to
 
04:34:58.150 --> 04:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
provide additional transparency could
 
04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
also have far-reaching negative impacts
 
04:35:02.230 --> 04:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
and ramifications to many valuable
 
04:35:04.470 --> 04:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
professional associations and Municipal
 
04:35:06.390 --> 04:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
officials that helped to keep costs for
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lower and with that I'm
 
04:35:12.429 --> 04:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
willing to accept any questions he did
 
04:35:15.750 --> 04:35:15.760 align:start position:0%

04:37:52.510 --> 04:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
deeds offices how it may affect the
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
public that uses the registry of deeds
 
04:37:58.029 --> 04:37:58.039 align:start position:0%
offices and local County government
 
04:37:59.629 --> 04:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
ultimately after receiving this
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
information it is a responsibility of
 
04:38:03.189 --> 04:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
each legislature to consider this
 
04:38:05.029 --> 04:38:05.039 align:start position:0%
information and to vote his or her
 
04:38:07.470 --> 04:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
conscience this bill if passed will take
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
away the ability of those who may have
 
04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
the most information regarding a bill
 
04:38:11.840 --> 04:38:13.269 align:start position:0%
the most information regarding a bill
from

04:38:13.269 --> 04:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:38:15.310 --> 04:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
testifying especially with the way that
 
04:38:17.310 --> 04:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
the bill is drafted I mean obviously
 
04:38:19.070 --> 04:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
we're not specifically we're not
 
04:38:20.830 --> 04:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
lobbying group but we feel that we have
 
04:38:23.709 --> 04:38:23.719 align:start position:0%
information hopefully that's important
 
04:38:28.269 --> 04:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
um dealing with the records um land
 
04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
records and property records uh real
 
04:38:32.470 --> 04:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
property records and how the those
 
04:38:35.109 --> 04:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
offices are run so two examples that the
 
04:38:36.629 --> 04:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire registry of deeds
 
04:38:38.910 --> 04:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
Association um has taken a position on
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
in this term it for example is the
 
04:38:43.830 --> 04:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment on the transfer on death deed
 
04:38:46.029 --> 04:38:46.039 align:start position:0%
statute and on the proposal to create a
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
landlord registry within the New
 
04:38:50.949 --> 04:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire registry of deeds offices the
 
04:38:52.990 --> 04:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
testimony information provided to the
 
04:38:54.429 --> 04:38:54.439 align:start position:0%
legislative committees by the New
 
04:38:56.830 --> 04:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire registry of deeds Association
 
04:38:59.470 --> 04:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
provided substant information so that
 
04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
each committee member's vote could be
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
more well informed um if House Bill 314
 
04:39:06.869 --> 04:39:06.879 align:start position:0%
we believe is passed that it's going to
 
04:39:09.470 --> 04:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
muzzle those um they're best able to
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
provide information on the topic of bill
 
04:39:14.109 --> 04:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
that is before a committee therefore the
 
04:39:16.189 --> 04:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
registry ad Deeds Association is asking
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
that house bill 314 um be voted in
 
04:39:20.551 --> 04:39:20.561 align:start position:0%
expedient to
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you uh would you be
 
04:39:25.750 --> 04:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions of course are
 
04:39:26.910 --> 04:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
there any
 
04:39:29.949 --> 04:39:29.959 align:start position:0%
questions I have one yes um are you
 
04:39:32.949 --> 04:39:32.959 align:start position:0%
aware in 15 colon one of the definitions
 
04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
of lobbyists uh it exempts uh testimony
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
before committee the concern that that
 
04:39:40.708 --> 04:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
we had with the bill the way that it's
 
04:39:42.430 --> 04:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
written that I I think was addressed by
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
the former speaker um the attorney
 
04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
representing believe the municipal
 
04:39:48.830 --> 04:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
Association is how that it's written
 
04:39:50.910 --> 04:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
that that may be interpreted differently
 
04:39:54.030 --> 04:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
in the statute um that it appears to be
 
04:39:56.910 --> 04:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
that anyone who is coming to testify who
 
04:40:01.110 --> 04:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
is maybe on um you know the time that
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know being paid for mileage or being
 
04:40:05.948 --> 04:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
or coming to testify taking time from
 
04:40:10.030 --> 04:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
work to do that might be then um subject
 
04:40:14.350 --> 04:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
to the um the fines and the penalties I
 
04:40:16.190 --> 04:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
believe it's a misdemeanor so that's a
 
04:40:17.590 --> 04:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
concern that the registry of deeds
 
04:40:20.270 --> 04:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
Association has with this bill great
 
04:40:22.270 --> 04:40:22.280 align:start position:0%

04:40:36.390 --> 04:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
public funds shall be used to attempt to
 
04:40:38.750 --> 04:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
influence legislation or participate in
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
political activity that that would
 
04:40:41.868 --> 04:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
include public
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
testimony um for any employee that is
 
04:40:48.110 --> 04:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
paid by state funds yes that's our
 
04:40:53.070 --> 04:40:53.080 align:start position:0%

04:41:17.230 --> 04:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
Jason Henry I'm superintendent of
 
04:41:19.948 --> 04:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County Jail uh I'm also
 
04:41:21.070 --> 04:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
legislative chair for Hampshire
 
04:41:22.830 --> 04:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
Association of counties and representing
 
04:41:24.230 --> 04:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
them I'm also a school board member as
 
04:41:27.150 --> 04:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
well too so I will I concur with most
 
04:41:28.430 --> 04:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
the testimony already happened in front
 
04:41:31.070 --> 04:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
of us my concern on this bill also is
 
04:41:33.910 --> 04:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
attempt to influence legislation uh I'm
 
04:41:36.230 --> 04:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
appointed official I'm concerned that it
 
04:41:38.190 --> 04:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
would I would create a misdemeanor by
 
04:41:39.948 --> 04:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
influencing it's not just here
 
04:41:41.788 --> 04:41:41.798 align:start position:0%
testifying I get called
 
04:41:43.708 --> 04:41:43.718 align:start position:0%
the last minute from house members
 
04:41:46.150 --> 04:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
senators and everything else for my
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
expertise on certain things I think
 
04:41:52.430 --> 04:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
there's a missoma on how the um CM
 
04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
lobbyist or how these groups work so for
 
04:41:56.270 --> 04:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
us we have a superintendent affiliate
 
04:41:57.948 --> 04:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
registered Deeds we meet as 10
 
04:42:00.190 --> 04:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent we look at these bills
 
04:42:02.470 --> 04:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
which are help with our um call them
 
04:42:06.628 --> 04:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
lobbyists to compile them and we best we
 
04:42:08.350 --> 04:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh stewards of taxpayer dollars look at
 
04:42:09.550 --> 04:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
is it going to affect how much it's
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
going to cost so we can reasonbly make
 
04:42:13.948 --> 04:42:13.958 align:start position:0%
decisions and come down here and
 
04:42:16.350 --> 04:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
testify then if we want to take a full
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
stance on something it's not just
 
04:42:19.030 --> 04:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
individuals it's a group and then from
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
there we go to our executive committee
 
04:42:22.430 --> 04:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
executive committee is made for us five
 
04:42:23.868 --> 04:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
members from each one of the counties
 
04:42:26.190 --> 04:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
who have to take a full vote on how we
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
wish to present down to here whether we
 
04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
want something it or we support
 
04:42:31.788 --> 04:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
something we support plenty of bills
 
04:42:34.628 --> 04:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
back and forth too so I think people
 
04:42:36.310 --> 04:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
concerned that there's not voices aren't
 
04:42:38.948 --> 04:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
being heard they're being heard by the
 
04:42:40.470 --> 04:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
experts that are in the field and as
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
some you with other Wards and other
 
04:42:42.910 --> 04:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
things that's what you elected for
 
04:42:44.750 --> 04:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
appointed for be a expert in the field
 
04:42:47.110 --> 04:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned that would stifle the
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
information be given to you guys any uh
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
funds be used for any lobbyist I'm sure
 
04:42:53.628 --> 04:42:53.638 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire spent some money down
 
04:42:55.270 --> 04:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
in DC because you can't be there every
 
04:42:58.190 --> 04:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
day helping back and forth so would this
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
prohibit that kind of behavior or
 
04:43:01.868 --> 04:43:01.878 align:start position:0%
whatever people want to call it
 
04:43:03.150 --> 04:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you guys to receive
 
04:43:05.270 --> 04:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
information I don't know I but I'm very
 
04:43:06.628 --> 04:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
concerned about the bill Association of
 
04:43:09.070 --> 04:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
county in general is opposed to this
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill um we opposed it in the past
 
04:43:12.670 --> 04:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
I don't waste your time because
 
04:43:14.590 --> 04:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
everybody else spoke on the other stuff
 
04:43:16.590 --> 04:43:16.600 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions thank you are
 
04:43:20.430 --> 04:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
there any questions I have one um you
 
04:43:22.150 --> 04:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you your executive
 
04:43:24.628 --> 04:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
committee I think you said has a has a
 
04:43:27.910 --> 04:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
member group of five five Per County F
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
Per County yeah um I'm not going to do
 
04:43:34.230 --> 04:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
the math there so um what I'm assuming
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
there's there are often decisions that
 
04:43:40.590 --> 04:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
are not unanimous correct um how does
 
04:43:40.600 --> 04:43:41.628 align:start position:0%
are not unanimous correct um how does
that

04:43:41.628 --> 04:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:45.670 --> 04:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
how does the minority get their voice
 
04:43:48.270 --> 04:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
um expressed here it doesn't stop
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
anybody from coming down in testifying
 
04:43:52.350 --> 04:43:52.360 align:start position:0%
whatsoever it's as an association itself
 
04:43:54.948 --> 04:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
we may say this but there are times that
 
04:43:56.830 --> 04:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
you can go down and testify that may be
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
against because it is five and
 
04:44:00.070 --> 04:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative it could be Comm
 
04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners nursing home directors
 
04:44:04.030 --> 04:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent anybody we may have
 
04:44:06.190 --> 04:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
opposing that does happen once in in a
 
04:44:07.628 --> 04:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
blue moon we try to talk it out and get
 
04:44:09.270 --> 04:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
on the same page but doesn't stop them
 
04:44:11.150 --> 04:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
from coming down and testifying in
 
04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
position or for something PR each other
 
04:44:15.310 --> 04:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
counties or they they're representing
 
04:44:19.390 --> 04:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
granting myself a followup um does that
 
04:44:22.708 --> 04:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that the um that both
 
04:44:25.030 --> 04:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
sides would be coming and testifying
 
04:44:27.510 --> 04:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
from your organization or would they
 
04:44:30.788 --> 04:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
would one be testifying as an individual
 
04:44:34.830 --> 04:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
and and the majority would be testifying
 
04:44:37.868 --> 04:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
from your organization or how how does
 
04:44:39.910 --> 04:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
so when we do vote that's a majority of
 
04:44:41.390 --> 04:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
the organization and again so that
 
04:44:42.830 --> 04:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
individuals could come down and testify
 
04:44:44.628 --> 04:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
individually against it and sometimes
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
when we can't come to consensus we don't
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
vote to say your unanimous incen down
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
and how we feel we a lot of bills we say
 
04:44:54.030 --> 04:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
that is up to your county up to your how
 
04:44:55.470 --> 04:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
you feel and those kinds of things so if
 
04:44:58.190 --> 04:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
we can't come to you I never don't come
 
04:44:59.708 --> 04:44:59.718 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent on something we just
 
04:45:01.430 --> 04:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
say then go down on your own and what
 
04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
works for your individual County because
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
some of these bills impact different
 
04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
areas differently so there are some
 
04:45:09.550 --> 04:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
bills we just do not take a stance on
 
04:45:11.230 --> 04:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much for your
 
04:45:15.150 --> 04:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
help no further questions thank you well
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
um it it looks to me like uh people
 
04:45:19.708 --> 04:45:19.718 align:start position:0%
listen to my admonition that we are
 
04:45:23.110 --> 04:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
going to end at uh exactly 2 o'clock um
 
04:45:25.750 --> 04:45:25.760 align:start position:0%

04:46:01.708 --> 04:46:01.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:05.110 --> 04:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
the representative home you are before
 
04:46:07.590 --> 04:46:07.600 align:start position:0%

testimony okay so here's my um and I'm
 
04:46:22.230 --> 04:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
not sure if the Secretary of State plans

um do you think that's
 
04:46:38.270 --> 04:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable okay otherwise I would have
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%

04:47:04.708 --> 04:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:10.990 --> 04:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:13.230 --> 04:47:13.240 align:start position:0%

coming for they're right over there got
 
04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
him thank you okay thank you Mr chairman
 
04:47:21.430 --> 04:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
for the record representative Bill M
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 10 city of nashwa first I'd
 
04:47:26.470 --> 04:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
like to say that the original bill is
 
04:47:29.670 --> 04:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
drafted doesn't work and I have a
 
04:47:31.150 --> 04:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
committee amendment that greatly
 
04:47:34.270 --> 04:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
simplifies the bill and that may be
 
04:47:37.990 --> 04:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient uh under state law not to be
 
04:47:40.110 --> 04:47:40.120 align:start position:0%
required so the problem I'm trying to
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
solve is
 
04:47:44.670 --> 04:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh to have disclosure of of campaign
 
04:47:47.628 --> 04:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
contributions of $1,000 or more and as a
 
04:47:49.390 --> 04:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office has pointed
 
04:47:52.990 --> 04:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
out to me under new legislation that was
 
04:47:56.030 --> 04:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
effective January of this year after my
 
04:47:58.190 --> 04:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
bill was originally drafted seems to
 
04:47:59.708 --> 04:47:59.718 align:start position:0%
cover most of that
 
04:48:02.948 --> 04:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
requirement and specifically the
 
04:48:07.030 --> 04:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:11.230 --> 04:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
6646 uh talks about a 48 hours reporting
 
04:48:13.548 --> 04:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
period for contributions of $1,000 or
 
04:48:15.670 --> 04:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
more which solves most of the problem
 
04:48:17.708 --> 04:48:17.718 align:start position:0%
that I'm trying to address here the only
 
04:48:21.030 --> 04:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
open issue is whether it's whether some
 
04:48:23.430 --> 04:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable reporting by The Secret of
 
04:48:25.628 --> 04:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
State's office without doing a lot of
 
04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
administrative overhead to give a
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
summary of these reports uh to the
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
public and that's my
 
04:48:36.510 --> 04:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you uh
 
04:48:38.830 --> 04:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
questions I have a couple are are we
 
04:48:40.548 --> 04:48:40.558 align:start position:0%
getting an amendment is that what I
 
04:48:40.558 --> 04:48:41.230 align:start position:0%
getting an amendment is that what I
understand

04:48:41.230 --> 04:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:48:44.708 --> 04:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
up here we go yeah um and this does this
 
04:48:46.628 --> 04:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
amendment replace the entire Bill
 
04:48:49.030 --> 04:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
correct it replaces the entire bill it
 
04:48:52.030 --> 04:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
simplifies uh sections and it talks
 
04:48:54.910 --> 04:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
about just reporting of a campaign
 
04:48:57.670 --> 04:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
contribution of $1,000 or more which may
 
04:49:00.788 --> 04:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
be covered under uh the new statute that
 
04:49:05.628 --> 04:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
took Effect generary one is um is this
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
going to mean additional reporting or
 
04:49:12.830 --> 04:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
replace existing reporting it would be a
 
04:49:16.670 --> 04:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
distant reporting of the uh existing
 
04:49:19.548 --> 04:49:19.558 align:start position:0%
forms so now there's a requirement
 
04:49:22.990 --> 04:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
report every six months December 30th
 
04:49:28.190 --> 04:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
June uh 30th uh for campaign
 
04:49:30.350 --> 04:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
contributions um I'm hoping that we can
 
04:49:33.070 --> 04:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
get more prompt reporting on these major
 
04:49:34.830 --> 04:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
contributions if it's not going to be a
 
04:49:36.830 --> 04:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
lot of work for the Secretary of
 
04:49:41.910 --> 04:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
State um last question for me um is
 
04:49:46.350 --> 04:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
the existing reporting is done on paper
 
04:49:48.788 --> 04:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
um by representatives and online I
 
04:49:52.590 --> 04:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
Believe by Senators um that would remain
 
04:49:54.670 --> 04:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
in this bill as well right yeah I've not
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
changed the reporting uh procedure okay
 
04:50:00.788 --> 04:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
all right um no further questions thank
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
you very much uh does the yes I have a
 
04:50:09.948 --> 04:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
pink card um deputy secretary of state
 
04:50:11.948 --> 04:50:11.958 align:start position:0%
Aon Hennessy thank you Mr chair members
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Aaron
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hennessy I am the deputy secretary of
 
04:50:16.750 --> 04:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
state can I just confirm what amendment
 
04:50:20.708 --> 04:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
number you're looking at yes it looks
 
04:50:25.590 --> 04:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
like uh 2025 D2
 
04:50:29.948 --> 04:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
0253 okay thank you so last year the um
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
house election law committee had a
 
04:50:35.350 --> 04:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
summerlong session of rewriting some of
 
04:50:38.750 --> 04:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
the campaign Finance laws and what they
 
04:50:40.310 --> 04:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
did was try and make it easier for
 
04:50:42.390 --> 04:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
people B to report it's still very
 
04:50:45.990 --> 04:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
voluminous election law um chapter
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
664 but um I believe what representative
 
04:50:52.230 --> 04:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
om is trying to do is to add a an
 
04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
additional report if you if you receive
 
04:50:59.628 --> 04:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
,000 contribution any time during
 
04:51:01.590 --> 04:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
December between the time of December to
 
04:51:03.548 --> 04:51:03.558 align:start position:0%
January that you would have to report
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
that within 48 Hours the law which was
 
04:51:12.110 --> 04:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
HB 1091 of 2024 took away the 48h hour
 
04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
report the previous 48 hour report only
 
04:51:17.110 --> 04:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
related to I believe was a $500
 
04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
contribution within 48 Hours of an
 
04:51:23.270 --> 04:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
election it's no longer in law so I
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
can't remember now it's gone um but I
 
04:51:28.510 --> 04:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
think that was his intention um but I do
 
04:51:30.430 --> 04:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
want to say that the way this
 
04:51:33.270 --> 04:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
amendment's written um it doesn't quite
 
04:51:36.190 --> 04:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
do that um and would only apply to
 
04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
candidates and not to political
 
04:51:41.548 --> 04:51:41.558 align:start position:0%
committees some candidates Rec uh sign
 
04:51:43.708 --> 04:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
up register with our office as a
 
04:51:45.670 --> 04:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
candidate committee which is now
 
04:51:47.590 --> 04:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
considered one of the political
 
04:51:50.868 --> 04:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
committees so this should really be if
 
04:51:54.190 --> 04:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
if you agree should be in section
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
6646 and as the chair pointed out um
 
04:51:59.230 --> 04:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
state representatives are not required
 
04:52:01.350 --> 04:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
to file their campaign Finance reports
 
04:52:03.548 --> 04:52:03.558 align:start position:0%
with our office electronically through
 
04:52:06.788 --> 04:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
our campaign Finance system so the
 
04:52:09.230 --> 04:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
requirement of us doing a monthly report
 
04:52:12.030 --> 04:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
to the legislature on these donations
 
04:52:14.390 --> 04:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
would have to be a lot of man hours from
 
04:52:16.430 --> 04:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
our office which we do not have right
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
now um unless you want to give us some
 
04:52:21.310 --> 04:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
more people um because we would have to
 
04:52:23.590 --> 04:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
manually go through each of the paper
 
04:52:26.350 --> 04:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
filings and summarize them each
 
04:52:28.990 --> 04:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
month I'm happy to take questions thank
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
you are there questions I have one um is
 
04:52:36.150 --> 04:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
there a plan in the future
 
04:52:38.830 --> 04:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
for um electronic filing for
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
Representatives is that there in the in
 
04:52:44.190 --> 04:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
the law and I don't remember what the
 
04:52:46.270 --> 04:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
the law states I think it's next
 
04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
election cycle so the 20 so after this
 
04:52:52.910 --> 04:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
election cycle ends which just started
 
04:52:54.868 --> 04:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
so two years from now I believe that's
 
04:52:57.430 --> 04:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
when State reps may have to start using
 
04:52:59.948 --> 04:52:59.958 align:start position:0%
mandatory file online some State reps
 
04:53:01.830 --> 04:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
already do file online through the
 
04:53:03.750 --> 04:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance system
 
04:53:07.628 --> 04:53:07.638 align:start position:0%
but so it's coming it's coming would
 
04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
that would that change um is this
 
04:53:12.910 --> 04:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
premature I guess is that what I'm
 
04:53:14.990 --> 04:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
saying um that that would definitely be
 
04:53:17.708 --> 04:53:17.718 align:start position:0%
a lot easier for our office because um
 
04:53:19.510 --> 04:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
if everyone did their campaign Finance
 
04:53:21.910 --> 04:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
Reports online then just a summary
 
04:53:24.628 --> 04:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
report could be generated by anyone not
 
04:53:27.350 --> 04:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily from our office however we
 
04:53:29.788 --> 04:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
would need to work with our vendor to
 
04:53:32.230 --> 04:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
create systematically the requirement
 
04:53:35.548 --> 04:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
for that report um because that's not
 
04:53:37.510 --> 04:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
one of the reports that's done right now
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
so there would be an expense to that I
 
04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
can't guess what that would
 
04:53:45.750 --> 04:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
be um last followup
 
04:53:50.230 --> 04:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
is is your testimony um wrapped
 
04:53:54.548 --> 04:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
into um the Ethics Committee testimony
 
04:53:57.708 --> 04:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
or does that have nothing to do with
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
your concerns on this bill that has
 
04:54:02.230 --> 04:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
me I'm just about campaign Finance piece
 
04:54:09.190 --> 04:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
yep represented payer thank you Mr chair
 
04:54:10.750 --> 04:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
just to clarify what I thought heard you
 
04:54:14.910 --> 04:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:17.310 --> 04:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
0253 um under section two it says each
 
04:54:19.788 --> 04:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
candidate and I thought I heard you say
 
04:54:21.750 --> 04:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
you suggest that be also political
 
04:54:25.470 --> 04:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
committees too include or did I get it
 
04:54:28.910 --> 04:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
wrong thanks for the question so this um
 
04:54:32.030 --> 04:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
this section of law refers back to the C
 
04:54:34.948 --> 04:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
the calendar of campaign Finance reports
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
that political committees have to do so
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
if you're going to change when somebody
 
04:54:40.628 --> 04:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
has to file a report it should shouldn't
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
be in
 
04:54:44.310 --> 04:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
6647 it should be in
 
04:54:48.548 --> 04:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
6646 section one one of the little
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
letters so so I'm clear candidates are
 
04:54:52.320 --> 04:54:54.110 align:start position:0%
letters so so I'm clear candidates are
in

04:54:54.110 --> 04:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:54:56.190 --> 04:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
seven candidates are in seven but
 
04:54:57.910 --> 04:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
they're reporting
 
04:55:01.390 --> 04:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
requirements um the line 15 of this
 
04:55:05.350 --> 04:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
amendment refers to 6646 134 and those
 
04:55:07.470 --> 04:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirements which are the
 
04:55:08.910 --> 04:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
ones that the political committees have
 
04:55:12.270 --> 04:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
to do think I got it
 
04:55:14.910 --> 04:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh further questions followup
 
04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
no um I think I'm set thank you very
 
04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%

um and I am going
 
04:56:35.628 --> 04:56:35.638 align:start position:0%
to recognize a motion from uh
 
04:56:35.638 --> 04:56:36.788 align:start position:0%
to recognize a motion from uh
representative

04:56:36.788 --> 04:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:56:40.350 --> 04:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
turot thank you Mr chairman uh like like
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
to make the motion of retain on HB 314
 
04:56:46.350 --> 04:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
representative turkot moves retain on
 
04:56:50.350 --> 04:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 314 is there a second second
 
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
seconded by uh representative shien uh
 
04:56:56.430 --> 04:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:59.470 --> 04:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
discussion briefly okay uh yeah just
 
04:57:02.070 --> 04:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
briefly um I think
 
04:57:06.390 --> 04:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
U we'd be rushed since it is an FN Bill
 
04:57:09.430 --> 04:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
we prefer or I prefer to uh have a
 
04:57:10.990 --> 04:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
little more time
 
04:57:14.310 --> 04:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
to amend if that's if that's the way we
 
04:57:15.910 --> 04:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
decide to go I know we I've heard a lot
 
04:57:18.990 --> 04:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
of testimony today that would uh tell me
 
04:57:20.750 --> 04:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
we if we're going to attempt this that
 
04:57:23.070 --> 04:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
we need to uh do some amendments so I
 
04:57:24.470 --> 04:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
think retaining at this point is the
 
04:57:27.270 --> 04:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
best best option for us thank you
 
04:57:29.670 --> 04:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative turkot I will just say
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
that um just to reiterate some of the
 
04:57:37.868 --> 04:57:37.878 align:start position:0%
concern that we have um is not our fault
 
04:57:40.910 --> 04:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
um we have a calendar to deal with and
 
04:57:44.868 --> 04:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
um and House Bill 314 as
 
04:57:47.190 --> 04:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
constituted um would be considered an
 
04:57:48.990 --> 04:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
early Bill meaning that it is going to
 
04:57:52.670 --> 04:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
go to a second committee
 
04:57:58.670 --> 04:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
um by retaining it um we have solved
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
that issue um and it also gives time for
 
04:58:08.670 --> 04:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
us to um then look at this bill uh for
 
04:58:10.750 --> 04:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
next term
 
04:58:14.270 --> 04:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and see if there's things that we can
 
04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
take from it or or we may meet as a as a
 
04:58:19.628 --> 04:58:19.638 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole which is what we
 
04:58:23.628 --> 04:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
typically do um or um in subcommittee
 
04:58:26.910 --> 04:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
but it would be this bill in its present
 
04:58:30.990 --> 04:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
form would be not non-existent until um
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
we're in another building thank you Mr
 
04:58:36.990 --> 04:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you for this motion um
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
we have a question on timing when might
 
04:58:44.510 --> 04:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
we work on this what uh do we have
 
04:58:46.590 --> 04:58:46.600 align:start position:0%
some thank you for your question we
 
04:58:52.150 --> 04:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:56.190 --> 04:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
um as the as the clerk likes to say um
 
04:58:59.230 --> 04:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
not in this building so when we move um
 
04:59:01.150 --> 04:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
we would be taking this up probably
 
04:59:04.030 --> 04:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
September or
 
04:59:06.910 --> 04:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
so representative payer hello I'm just
 
04:59:08.510 --> 04:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
curious what's the second committee that
 
04:59:12.830 --> 04:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
we would send this to I I'm assuming um
 
04:59:16.070 --> 04:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
because there is a uh we're all set
 
04:59:18.628 --> 04:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
actually now we've got yeah we're good
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
to go is it thanks for your help is it
 
04:59:22.430 --> 04:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
Finance is that what you meant um I
 
04:59:24.190 --> 04:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
think no because it's not really a
 
04:59:25.830 --> 04:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
financial issue I think it would
 
04:59:28.270 --> 04:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
probably go to criminal justice would be
 
04:59:31.070 --> 04:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
my guess but okay I was just curious um
 
04:59:33.670 --> 04:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's probably my least favorite
 
04:59:35.788 --> 04:59:35.798 align:start position:0%
part of this whole bill so if that gives
 
04:59:39.310 --> 04:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
you any indication any so um the motion
 
04:59:43.750 --> 04:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
on the floor is um retain on House Bill
 
04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
314 and I will ask the clerk to call the
 
04:59:52.430 --> 04:59:52.440 align:start position:0%

05:01:07.628 --> 05:01:07.638 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration thank you Mr
 
05:01:10.670 --> 05:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
chair thank you honorable members of the
 
05:01:12.590 --> 05:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
05:01:14.390 --> 05:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I represent Rockingham 10 new
 
05:01:16.350 --> 05:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
market in new Fields thank
 
05:01:19.230 --> 05:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
you um this is similar to bills you have
 
05:01:21.270 --> 05:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
seen in the past including one bill that
 
05:01:22.590 --> 05:01:22.600 align:start position:0%
enjoyed quite a bit of support on the
 
05:01:24.150 --> 05:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
floor last
 
05:01:27.190 --> 05:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
year it has two parts I was trying to
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
work with my colleague um regarding both
 
05:01:32.350 --> 05:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
of our bills and we didn't manage to
 
05:01:33.948 --> 05:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
coordinate our language like we
 
05:01:36.990 --> 05:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
originally intended through OS but I'll
 
05:01:39.270 --> 05:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
go through the the first part first and
 
05:01:41.708 --> 05:01:41.718 align:start position:0%
if the committee to divide out and and
 
05:01:43.948 --> 05:01:43.958 align:start position:0%
take out the second part that's also
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
something I would
 
05:01:49.390 --> 05:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
support So as you may recall the Public
 
05:01:51.470 --> 05:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
service loan forgiveness program is a
 
05:01:54.430 --> 05:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
federal program that was created under
 
05:01:57.990 --> 05:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
the George W Bush Administration in 2007
 
05:01:59.868 --> 05:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
the intention of the Public service loan
 
05:02:02.070 --> 05:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
forgiveness program is to encourage
 
05:02:04.628 --> 05:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
young people to enter Public
 
05:02:07.150 --> 05:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
Service the program only applies for
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
federal student loans it does not apply
 
05:02:11.990 --> 05:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
for private student loans and to qualify
 
05:02:16.030 --> 05:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
a person must make 120 ontime payments
 
05:02:18.270 --> 05:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
while they are employed in public
 
05:02:20.830 --> 05:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
service and that definition is very very
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
exact um once those 10 years of payments
 
05:02:26.470 --> 05:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
are made while in public service um if
 
05:02:28.270 --> 05:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
they are approved any of the remaining
 
05:02:30.110 --> 05:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
federal student loans after those 10
 
05:02:33.150 --> 05:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
years of payments is Forgiven um public
 
05:02:36.110 --> 05:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
service is defined in the statute the
 
05:02:40.390 --> 05:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
federal statute as either nonprofit work
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
or any governmental work in the United
 
05:02:47.230 --> 05:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
States including federal state local and
 
05:02:51.070 --> 05:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
tribal so any government um position in
 
05:02:54.548 --> 05:02:54.558 align:start position:0%
this country um as well as nonprofit an
 
05:02:56.910 --> 05:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
applicant uh can qualify with various
 
05:02:58.990 --> 05:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
types of Public Service kind of cobbled
 
05:03:00.788 --> 05:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
together so you might have two years in
 
05:03:03.990 --> 05:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
public office four years teaching um a
 
05:03:05.948 --> 05:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
couple years with the dot you can put
 
05:03:07.628 --> 05:03:07.638 align:start position:0%
all that together to qualify for those
 
05:03:10.350 --> 05:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
120 ontime payments
 
05:03:12.270 --> 05:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
there are lots of rules around the
 
05:03:15.070 --> 05:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
Public service loan forgiveness program
 
05:03:17.788 --> 05:03:17.798 align:start position:0%
um for example certain governmental
 
05:03:19.948 --> 05:03:19.958 align:start position:0%
contractors count other contractors do
 
05:03:22.150 --> 05:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
not count when Congress passed this
 
05:03:24.110 --> 05:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
program they very explicitly Exempted
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
only themselves only Federal legislators
 
05:03:28.788 --> 05:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
so as to not have a conflict of interest
 
05:03:30.910 --> 05:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
they did not very intentionally did not
 
05:03:33.990 --> 05:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
exempt any uh state legislatures in fact
 
05:03:37.230 --> 05:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
most of the states to um certify their
 
05:03:40.190 --> 05:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
public servants their legislators as
 
05:03:40.200 --> 05:03:41.868 align:start position:0%
public servants their legislators as
public

05:03:41.868 --> 05:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:03:45.070 --> 05:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
service the form that an employe
 
05:03:47.910 --> 05:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
employer receives to qualify that
 
05:03:50.230 --> 05:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
person's time working there as public
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
service has essentially six lines uh
 
05:03:55.030 --> 05:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
that includes the name and address of
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
the uh employer the start and end dates
 
05:04:00.190 --> 05:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
of the service the EIN number the
 
05:04:03.510 --> 05:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
employer identification number um and
 
05:04:05.788 --> 05:04:05.798 align:start position:0%
the um yeah which the federal government
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
then goes by to determine whether the
 
05:04:10.670 --> 05:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
organization qualifies
 
05:04:12.590 --> 05:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire state legislators are
 
05:04:16.310 --> 05:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
paid a BAL salary of $200 per the state
 
05:04:20.270 --> 05:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
constitution part 2 Article 15 the EIN
 
05:04:23.190 --> 05:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
number and I actually this is from last
 
05:04:26.110 --> 05:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
year but this is my last
 
05:04:29.948 --> 05:04:29.958 align:start position:0%
terms W2 for my State
 
05:04:34.470 --> 05:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
Legislative uh work $200 the EIN number
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
02y 60000 618 is the same employer
 
05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
number that any state employee in this
 
05:04:45.510 --> 05:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
state has if you are working as a road
 
05:04:48.750 --> 05:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
crew member for the dot if you are
 
05:04:51.030 --> 05:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
working for the fish and game department
 
05:04:53.830 --> 05:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
um members behind me have the same exact
 
05:04:56.030 --> 05:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
EIN number because your employer
 
05:04:57.910 --> 05:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
identification number I understand that
 
05:04:59.910 --> 05:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
we have a narrative in the state and I
 
05:05:01.868 --> 05:05:01.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate it that we are a volunteer
 
05:05:04.390 --> 05:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
legislature that we are uh not
 
05:05:06.270 --> 05:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
technically employees and that's fine
 
05:05:08.030 --> 05:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
how we have things is fine but as far as
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government's concerned
 
05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
we are employees you don't give W2s to
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
people who are non employees W2s only
 
05:05:17.750 --> 05:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
exist for employees and that $200 we get
 
05:05:19.548 --> 05:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
gets taxes taken
 
05:05:21.868 --> 05:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
out you get your Medicaid and your
 
05:05:24.190 --> 05:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
Social Security taxes taken out of that
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
$200 by the way at the time it was
 
05:05:29.350 --> 05:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
established it was um enough it was
 
05:05:32.350 --> 05:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
based on the average salary of the not
 
05:05:34.310 --> 05:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
salary but income of a farmer at the
 
05:05:37.070 --> 05:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
time and it was enough at the time to
 
05:05:39.708 --> 05:05:39.718 align:start position:0%
buy four acres with a house so it was
 
05:05:41.830 --> 05:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
always intended to be compensation for
 
05:05:44.350 --> 05:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
employment having said that I want to
 
05:05:47.628 --> 05:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
bring it back around so in the past
 
05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
state legislators have applied for um
 
05:05:52.910 --> 05:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that they have served an office
 
05:05:55.868 --> 05:05:55.878 align:start position:0%
public office um to count towards their
 
05:05:57.390 --> 05:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
public service for Public service loan
 
05:05:59.430 --> 05:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
forgiveness that's been traditionally
 
05:06:02.990 --> 05:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
sent to um Das and hold
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
on just want to check and uh the well
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
sorry the accounting office has
 
05:06:10.548 --> 05:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
historically deced Ed not to certify
 
05:06:12.270 --> 05:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
legislators applications when they were
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
asked because they said and I went
 
05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
through a whole bunch of emails with
 
05:06:16.750 --> 05:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
them they said it was on the basis that
 
05:06:18.030 --> 05:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't consider us employees
 
05:06:19.430 --> 05:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
because we were elected and served a
 
05:06:21.270 --> 05:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
term rather than going through normal
 
05:06:23.830 --> 05:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
hiring or firing processes I will point
 
05:06:25.990 --> 05:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
out that we have a number of state
 
05:06:28.990 --> 05:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
employees that are elected and do not go
 
05:06:30.750 --> 05:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
through a normal hiring and firing
 
05:06:32.510 --> 05:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
process for example the Secretary of
 
05:06:34.990 --> 05:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
State the clerks of the various the two
 
05:06:37.230 --> 05:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
Chambers and the state treasurer are all
 
05:06:39.110 --> 05:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
elected positions yet they are
 
05:06:41.190 --> 05:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
considered employees they get the same
 
05:06:42.910 --> 05:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
Ein on their
 
05:06:47.110 --> 05:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
W2 um and they qualify for for Public
 
05:06:49.948 --> 05:06:49.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:51.868 --> 05:06:51.878 align:start position:0%
forgiveness further the commissioner of
 
05:06:52.750 --> 05:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
05:06:55.110 --> 05:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
Services last year when we had this uh
 
05:06:56.788 --> 05:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
Charles Arling house uh repeatedly
 
05:06:58.510 --> 05:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
stated that he was fine and had no
 
05:07:00.590 --> 05:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
reason to oppose the certification of
 
05:07:05.990 --> 05:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
legislators so a few years back we
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
passed RSA 14 a Col 6 this allowed state
 
05:07:15.708 --> 05:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
legislators access to employee benefits
 
05:07:17.230 --> 05:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
while saying that this does not mean
 
05:07:19.110 --> 05:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
that they're employees they're not
 
05:07:20.948 --> 05:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
employees in terms of how the state
 
05:07:22.390 --> 05:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
considers them they are employees for
 
05:07:25.470 --> 05:07:25.480 align:start position:0%
how the feds consider us but we're going
 
05:07:28.350 --> 05:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
to still give them access to employee
 
05:07:31.788 --> 05:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
benefits we did that and in the same way
 
05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
this would also give us that same access
 
05:07:37.310 --> 05:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
to employee benefits um but while we did
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
that that actually cost a little bit
 
05:07:40.590 --> 05:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
because they're covering us under the
 
05:07:42.350 --> 05:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
EAP program there's some administrative
 
05:07:44.430 --> 05:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
cost to uh even though we take on the
 
05:07:46.670 --> 05:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
full amount for health insurance there's
 
05:07:48.310 --> 05:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
some administrative cost there in
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
including us there's some cost there's
 
05:07:52.948 --> 05:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely zero cost to Simply
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
certifying that we are operating in
 
05:07:55.878 --> 05:07:57.830 align:start position:0%
certifying that we are operating in
public

05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:08:02.708 --> 05:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
service so the idea that we would want
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
to provide this for legislators is
 
05:08:08.750 --> 05:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
important because right now we have a
 
05:08:11.030 --> 05:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
body because of the volunteer position
 
05:08:13.430 --> 05:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
the $100 a year where it's exceedingly
 
05:08:15.670 --> 05:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
hard to get the average New Hampshire
 
05:08:17.910 --> 05:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
person to run for office because if you
 
05:08:20.708 --> 05:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
try to recruit the most people say oh
 
05:08:22.150 --> 05:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
the great I'm very interested in running
 
05:08:24.590 --> 05:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
for office how much does it
 
05:08:28.590 --> 05:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
pay I'm sorry I can't quit my job I have
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
to pay my mortgage I have to pay my rent
 
05:08:33.990 --> 05:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's very hard so what we have currently
 
05:08:36.270 --> 05:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
is a body that does not look like the
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
rest of the state it is older wider and
 
05:08:42.510 --> 05:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
most importantly richer than the rest of
 
05:08:45.190 --> 05:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
the state it's not representative the
 
05:08:46.990 --> 05:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
way the House of Representatives is
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be and I think in order to
 
05:08:52.030 --> 05:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
pass legislation that looks that that
 
05:08:53.590 --> 05:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
reflects the will of the people we need
 
05:08:55.150 --> 05:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
to have a body that reflects the will of
 
05:08:56.830 --> 05:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
the people and in order to do that we
 
05:08:59.670 --> 05:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
can encourage younger people working AE
 
05:09:01.470 --> 05:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
people to actually run for office by
 
05:09:04.868 --> 05:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
providing these very small free benefits
 
05:09:07.190 --> 05:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
again it doesn't cost us anything and
 
05:09:09.390 --> 05:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
it's the least of the ass just say hey
 
05:09:11.070 --> 05:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
the service that I've provided here
 
05:09:13.230 --> 05:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
counts for public service because we all
 
05:09:15.990 --> 05:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
to call ourselves public servants we say
 
05:09:18.350 --> 05:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
that proudly but we're not going to
 
05:09:22.990 --> 05:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:26.750 --> 05:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
sense so not only does it not cost New
 
05:09:28.590 --> 05:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire any money whatsoever but New
 
05:09:30.990 --> 05:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a federal income donor
 
05:09:33.948 --> 05:09:33.958 align:start position:0%
State meaning our tax dollars um don't
 
05:09:36.190 --> 05:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
come back to us in federal services in
 
05:09:38.070 --> 05:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
the same amount that we send them out
 
05:09:40.628 --> 05:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
other states are beneficiaries of our
 
05:09:43.390 --> 05:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
federal tax dollarss from our workers
 
05:09:46.990 --> 05:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
which means because of of the 19 States
 
05:09:50.030 --> 05:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
I am currently aware of 17 of them
 
05:09:52.628 --> 05:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
certify their state representative
 
05:09:54.670 --> 05:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
Service as public service including
 
05:09:56.510 --> 05:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
states that have what they consider to
 
05:09:57.708 --> 05:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
be part-time
 
05:10:00.150 --> 05:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
legislatures and even legislatures that
 
05:10:02.948 --> 05:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
only meet once every two years but they
 
05:10:04.670 --> 05:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
certify their
 
05:10:07.548 --> 05:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
service so that means our State dollars
 
05:10:10.150 --> 05:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
are going to forgive Mass Metts
 
05:10:12.750 --> 05:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
legislators California
 
05:10:15.190 --> 05:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
legislators but not our own legislators
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
who don't even get
 
05:10:20.190 --> 05:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
paid now I do want to bring up the
 
05:10:22.270 --> 05:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
question of okay you know is it really
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
full-time service because we are a
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
part-time legislature our session only
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
lasts half the year because when it was
 
05:10:30.230 --> 05:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
created in this way most people were
 
05:10:32.150 --> 05:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
farmers so they actually and they had to
 
05:10:34.470 --> 05:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
travel by horse they came all the way in
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
stayed for half the year and would go
 
05:10:37.430 --> 05:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
back to their
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
Farms so
 
05:10:42.948 --> 05:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
we are a part-time legis legislature but
 
05:10:45.310 --> 05:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
at no point are you an off-duty
 
05:10:48.150 --> 05:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
legislator you never get to take off
 
05:10:50.750 --> 05:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
your role as a state rep if you get
 
05:10:53.590 --> 05:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
arrested the newspapers don't say off
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
duty State Rep they say State Rep you
 
05:10:58.910 --> 05:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
are always 100% every second of the day
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
accountable to your voters for every
 
05:11:03.270 --> 05:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
action you take whether it's here or
 
05:11:03.280 --> 05:11:04.390 align:start position:0%
action you take whether it's here or
anywhere

05:11:04.390 --> 05:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
05:11:07.548 --> 05:11:07.558 align:start position:0%
else I answer constituent emails texts
 
05:11:10.190 --> 05:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
and phone calls at all hours of day all
 
05:11:12.750 --> 05:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
days of the year weekends I this past
 
05:11:14.788 --> 05:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
Christmas I at 11:00 at night on
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
Christmas Eve was helping a constituent
 
05:11:19.110 --> 05:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
and in contact with the
 
05:11:22.270 --> 05:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
constituent so we are full-time
 
05:11:25.030 --> 05:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
legislators even though session is
 
05:11:28.910 --> 05:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:31.030 --> 05:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
legislature so yes the majority of
 
05:11:33.948 --> 05:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
States already give this
 
05:11:37.070 --> 05:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
um validation validation is what it's
 
05:11:38.910 --> 05:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
not even a benefit it's just validating
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
our service almost all the states
 
05:11:43.788 --> 05:11:43.798 align:start position:0%
already do that certainly of the ones
 
05:11:46.030 --> 05:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority of the ones that
 
05:11:48.670 --> 05:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
um I've been able to get information
 
05:11:52.270 --> 05:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
on um including our neighboring states
 
05:11:54.548 --> 05:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
uh there's a whole I think the house
 
05:11:56.670 --> 05:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
clerk has a a more comprehensive list
 
05:11:58.510 --> 05:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
than I
 
05:12:01.390 --> 05:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
do and I just want to bring that this
 
05:12:03.788 --> 05:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
piece back around to the idea that the
 
05:12:05.868 --> 05:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
whole point of the pslf program under
 
05:12:07.868 --> 05:12:07.878 align:start position:0%
George W Bush was to incentivize young
 
05:12:09.628 --> 05:12:09.638 align:start position:0%
people into public service we not doing
 
05:12:11.548 --> 05:12:11.558 align:start position:0%
that with the income here right we don't
 
05:12:14.030 --> 05:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
do that we keep retired people here we
 
05:12:15.910 --> 05:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
don't help working people to get into
 
05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
this place to affect change in ways in
 
05:12:21.150 --> 05:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
ways that would resonate with that
 
05:12:23.548 --> 05:12:23.558 align:start position:0%
people like them the least we can do is
 
05:12:24.990 --> 05:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
say well if you're going to serve an
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
office then this is public service um
 
05:12:30.270 --> 05:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
and we desperately need that kind of
 
05:12:32.270 --> 05:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
representation here as for the second
 
05:12:35.350 --> 05:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
part of the bill um it is similar to
 
05:12:36.990 --> 05:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
something you've already heard I've
 
05:12:38.070 --> 05:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
personally gone through this I know
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
other legislators have gone through this
 
05:12:41.510 --> 05:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
so what this is is that if you are a
 
05:12:43.390 --> 05:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
working person and you're trying to
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
serve an office right now your employer
 
05:12:48.430 --> 05:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
can keep you from coming here and in my
 
05:12:50.948 --> 05:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
case my employer absolutely kept me from
 
05:12:53.070 --> 05:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
showing up to a session day where the
 
05:12:55.708 --> 05:12:55.718 align:start position:0%
headliner bill was something that he
 
05:12:57.548 --> 05:12:57.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely knew he disagreed with me on
 
05:13:00.670 --> 05:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
it was a gay uh rights issue he
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely disagreed with me and
 
05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
prohibited me from showing up so I don't
 
05:13:08.590 --> 05:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
know why we're allowing employers to
 
05:13:11.750 --> 05:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
affect legislative outcomes that way
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
when in fact a police officer cannot
 
05:13:17.628 --> 05:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
detain us on our way to session when in
 
05:13:21.150 --> 05:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
fact the speaker can force us our compel
 
05:13:22.788 --> 05:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
our attendance it hasn't happened in any
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
kind of recent time but can compel Us by
 
05:13:27.510 --> 05:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
force can send police officers to pick
 
05:13:29.628 --> 05:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
us up and bring us into session that is
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
how sacred our constitutional duty to
 
05:13:34.270 --> 05:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
this body is that we say we can actually
 
05:13:36.910 --> 05:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
take away your bodily autonomy and force
 
05:13:39.708 --> 05:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
you in here because you agreed to serve
 
05:13:44.390 --> 05:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
in public office and jury duty is
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
covered as a protected reason to miss
 
05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
work we get out of jury duty if we have
 
05:13:53.788 --> 05:13:53.798 align:start position:0%
session on the days we're supposed to
 
05:13:57.070 --> 05:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
serve yet our employer who has to give
 
05:13:58.868 --> 05:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
us time off for jury duty doesn't have
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
to give us time off for this place even
 
05:14:03.750 --> 05:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
though this place supersedes jury
 
05:14:06.470 --> 05:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
duty so I don't know why we're allowing
 
05:14:08.390 --> 05:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
employers to do that when this is an
 
05:14:11.150 --> 05:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
unpaid day off they can require that an
 
05:14:13.310 --> 05:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
employee in this bill can require an
 
05:14:14.830 --> 05:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
employee use their paid time off that
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
they've AC Creed if they've accured any
 
05:14:18.030 --> 05:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
um and they have to give a two-day
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
notice ahead of time to let because we
 
05:14:22.390 --> 05:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
only get a minimum of three-day notice
 
05:14:24.628 --> 05:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
for hearings and what have you um so
 
05:14:26.708 --> 05:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
this would be a two-day notice to the
 
05:14:28.190 --> 05:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
employer otherwise you would not be
 
05:14:30.430 --> 05:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
covered and that's the entirety of the
 
05:14:32.390 --> 05:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
bill like I said two different pieces
 
05:14:35.190 --> 05:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
both affect the idea that we want more
 
05:14:37.830 --> 05:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
working age Working Class People in this
 
05:14:39.548 --> 05:14:39.558 align:start position:0%
body to represent
 
05:14:41.548 --> 05:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
what actual people in New Hampshire look
 
05:14:43.390 --> 05:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
like that is how they're connected but
 
05:14:45.708 --> 05:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions thank you
 
05:14:47.230 --> 05:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
for your testimony are there any
 
05:14:50.390 --> 05:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
questions yeah represent thank you are
 
05:14:53.150 --> 05:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you re Reed are you you gonna
 
05:14:56.030 --> 05:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
submit anything written no I just have
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
my own personal notes but I'm happy if
 
05:15:00.548 --> 05:15:00.558 align:start position:0%
you would like me to I can kind of give
 
05:15:01.830 --> 05:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
you like the bullet points but it's not
 
05:15:04.230 --> 05:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
in a written testimony format that would
 
05:15:06.030 --> 05:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
be helpful sure because you said a lot
 
05:15:07.788 --> 05:15:07.798 align:start position:0%
which is good stuff but just keep it all
 
05:15:11.788 --> 05:15:11.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:14.430 --> 05:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
wall thank you very much Madam chairman
 
05:15:15.750 --> 05:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony
 
05:15:17.830 --> 05:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative Reed um did I hear you
 
05:15:21.548 --> 05:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
correctly it said 17 other states allow
 
05:15:25.110 --> 05:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
this of the 19 that I have researched
 
05:15:27.670 --> 05:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
because I personally am a member of two
 
05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
national organizations of state
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
legislators um ncel and the national
 
05:15:36.030 --> 05:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
women's legislator um yeah whatever so I
 
05:15:37.510 --> 05:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
go to these conventions so I've I've
 
05:15:39.708 --> 05:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
developed connections with other state
 
05:15:43.110 --> 05:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
legislators so I went through all of my
 
05:15:46.430 --> 05:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
connections um and of these 19 states
 
05:15:48.910 --> 05:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
that I was able to find out information
 
05:15:52.830 --> 05:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
on 17 of them definitely do certify
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
Public Service followup including
 
05:15:58.030 --> 05:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
part-time part-time and one out of every
 
05:16:01.628 --> 05:16:01.638 align:start position:0%
two-year uh legislators legislator okay
 
05:16:04.190 --> 05:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you clarify for me in case I
 
05:16:05.990 --> 05:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
didn't hear correctly you to talk very
 
05:16:07.910 --> 05:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
fast and you had a load of information I
 
05:16:11.830 --> 05:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you um so you said they
 
05:16:15.270 --> 05:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
certify these employees um does that
 
05:16:17.830 --> 05:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
mean these employees who have not earned
 
05:16:21.270 --> 05:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
time off do get time off to so those are
 
05:16:24.310 --> 05:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
two different pieces of the bill the
 
05:16:28.390 --> 05:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
first piece is saying that us as state
 
05:16:31.150 --> 05:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
Reps for the purposes of the Public
 
05:16:32.670 --> 05:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
service loan forgiveness program which
 
05:16:34.750 --> 05:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
is a federal program under George W bush
 
05:16:37.510 --> 05:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
that after 10 years of ontime payments
 
05:16:40.670 --> 05:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
while you are working in Public Service
 
05:16:42.390 --> 05:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
um you get the rest of your loans
 
05:16:45.430 --> 05:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
forgiven all as far as I can tell almost
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
all the other states do this for their
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
legislators but we don't and we're
 
05:16:52.310 --> 05:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
saying this is the least you can do is
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
just certify a piece of paper that's
 
05:16:55.910 --> 05:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
saying yes you you served in public
 
05:16:58.030 --> 05:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
service from whenever you swore in to
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
whenever you left office that's
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
literally all that piece is asking for
 
05:17:05.190 --> 05:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
the second piece the second piece which
 
05:17:05.200 --> 05:17:06.190 align:start position:0%
the second piece the second piece which
is

05:17:06.190 --> 05:17:06.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:17:08.150 --> 05:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
related the second piece which is
 
05:17:10.310 --> 05:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
related through the idea that all of
 
05:17:12.708 --> 05:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to make it easier
 
05:17:15.310 --> 05:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
for younger working people to serve the
 
05:17:17.708 --> 05:17:17.718 align:start position:0%
second piece is an employer employee
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
employee protection for a legislator
 
05:17:22.190 --> 05:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
saying that you get your employer cannot
 
05:17:24.390 --> 05:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
discipline you if you give them two days
 
05:17:26.270 --> 05:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
in in advanced notice that you have to
 
05:17:29.390 --> 05:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
attend session or a hearing or a
 
05:17:31.070 --> 05:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
committee that you are a member of or a
 
05:17:33.830 --> 05:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on a bill that you sponsor of
 
05:17:36.788 --> 05:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
got it thank you sorry for the
 
05:17:40.270 --> 05:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
confusion any other questions rep away
 
05:17:43.590 --> 05:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh so my question
 
05:17:46.110 --> 05:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
is in regards to those other states that
 
05:17:48.990 --> 05:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
have uh that allow their legislators to
 
05:17:51.390 --> 05:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
count this towards Public Service did
 
05:17:54.670 --> 05:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
they have to do that through legislation
 
05:17:59.548 --> 05:17:59.558 align:start position:0%
or um was it just evaluated differently
 
05:18:02.788 --> 05:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
from the federal level um that they
 
05:18:04.628 --> 05:18:04.638 align:start position:0%
consider that full-time service because
 
05:18:08.070 --> 05:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the reason they denied New
 
05:18:10.990 --> 05:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rep is that it's an elected
 
05:18:13.750 --> 05:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
position and not hired through TR
 
05:18:15.270 --> 05:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
traditional means I'm just wondering are
 
05:18:18.750 --> 05:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
those other states doing this through
 
05:18:20.948 --> 05:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
legislative means so as far as I'm aware
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
the vast majority did not have to pass a
 
05:18:24.868 --> 05:18:24.878 align:start position:0%
law because they were just getting their
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
service certified actually most other
 
05:18:30.150 --> 05:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
states do don't have this weird argument
 
05:18:32.310 --> 05:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
because most of them get paid at least a
 
05:18:34.030 --> 05:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
stien level so they don't have this
 
05:18:35.948 --> 05:18:35.958 align:start position:0%
weird like we're a volunteer legislature
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
argument that we're not actually
 
05:18:39.390 --> 05:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
employees so they are considered
 
05:18:41.390 --> 05:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
employees in most other states even if
 
05:18:43.510 --> 05:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
they're only getting like $115,000 as a
 
05:18:46.470 --> 05:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
stipend which sounds like a lot for us
 
05:18:49.230 --> 05:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
right but that's not a lot for other
 
05:18:52.390 --> 05:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
reps um I think California is in the six
 
05:18:54.270 --> 05:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
digits Massachusetts I think is up to
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
90,000 but Tennessee I know is like the
 
05:19:01.310 --> 05:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
$155,000 range um so and there are other
 
05:19:03.430 --> 05:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
states that do pay very little or per
 
05:19:05.910 --> 05:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
DMS but I think that we are officially
 
05:19:08.910 --> 05:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
the least paid um so having said that
 
05:19:10.910 --> 05:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
most of them do kind of don't have this
 
05:19:12.270 --> 05:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
argument that you're not really an
 
05:19:13.948 --> 05:19:13.958 align:start position:0%
employee of the state they kind of
 
05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
already are um in terms of the part-time
 
05:19:18.150 --> 05:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
full-time thing they haven't
 
05:19:20.230 --> 05:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
administratively just haven't made up an
 
05:19:22.670 --> 05:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
issue of that so they just certify the
 
05:19:24.270 --> 05:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
you're you're a full-time legislator
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of how often session actually
 
05:19:27.948 --> 05:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
happens you never stop being a
 
05:19:30.948 --> 05:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
legislator um I there may be states that
 
05:19:32.990 --> 05:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
did do it by law but as far as I know
 
05:19:33.990 --> 05:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
they just didn't have to because they
 
05:19:36.670 --> 05:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
weren't getting denied um what I said
 
05:19:40.030 --> 05:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
was not any kind of official um like
 
05:19:42.070 --> 05:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
thing but when I was going in emails why
 
05:19:45.150 --> 05:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
were people being denied this particular
 
05:19:47.708 --> 05:19:47.718 align:start position:0%
thing with the accounting office they
 
05:19:49.830 --> 05:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
said that that was their rationale but
 
05:19:52.628 --> 05:19:52.638 align:start position:0%
it wasn't like an official like it was
 
05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
just what they said their rationale for
 
05:19:56.910 --> 05:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
making that decision
 
05:20:01.708 --> 05:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
was follow sure yeah thank you um and
 
05:20:06.230 --> 05:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
have you reached out to um the uh Public
 
05:20:09.548 --> 05:20:09.558 align:start position:0%
service loan forgiveness program to
 
05:20:13.670 --> 05:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
confirm that this legislation would then
 
05:20:17.070 --> 05:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
qualify um no because it really just
 
05:20:19.750 --> 05:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
comes down to that form and for what
 
05:20:22.830 --> 05:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
it's worth I did get my loans forgiven
 
05:20:24.628 --> 05:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
which is why I feel no problems
 
05:20:26.230 --> 05:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this because I have no dog in
 
05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
the fight at this point um but they it's
 
05:20:32.350 --> 05:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
it's a form that you give to all of your
 
05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
Republic Service employers or anyone you
 
05:20:36.830 --> 05:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
thought was a public service employer
 
05:20:38.670 --> 05:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
they fill out their EIN number which is
 
05:20:41.670 --> 05:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
how the feds know the Ein that they
 
05:20:43.788 --> 05:20:43.798 align:start position:0%
would be filling out for us is the same
 
05:20:46.390 --> 05:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
Ein as every other state employee which
 
05:20:49.150 --> 05:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
qualifies the Ein qualifies it is on the
 
05:20:53.270 --> 05:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
list our Ein on our W2 for our $200 is
 
05:20:55.788 --> 05:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
on the list of qualifying Ein for the
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
federal government that says that this
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
is an EIN that if you have service under
 
05:21:01.750 --> 05:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
this Ein you have employment under this
 
05:21:03.548 --> 05:21:03.558 align:start position:0%
Ein you
 
05:21:06.510 --> 05:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
qualify so anyone who gets that W2 with
 
05:21:10.030 --> 05:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
that EIN number qual that time period
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
qualifies yeah thank you I'm sorry I
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't should not recognize the
 
05:21:17.788 --> 05:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:21:24.070 --> 05:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
Richards just to so was your the Ein
 
05:21:25.948 --> 05:21:25.958 align:start position:0%
that you just said
 
05:21:30.470 --> 05:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
qualified um from here part of your 120
 
05:21:32.110 --> 05:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
is was it part of what you Cobble
 
05:21:35.270 --> 05:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
together or did you no I have you had it
 
05:21:37.830 --> 05:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
qualified through other means not
 
05:21:40.470 --> 05:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
through thank you been a an adjunct
 
05:21:42.788 --> 05:21:42.798 align:start position:0%
teacher at Community College I've been a
 
05:21:45.948 --> 05:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
driver for public transit I have been a
 
05:21:48.150 --> 05:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
teacher at other places I have a lot of
 
05:21:50.708 --> 05:21:50.718 align:start position:0%
public service that qualified other than
 
05:21:51.990 --> 05:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
house but it before I got my loans
 
05:21:58.230 --> 05:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
forgiven this would have increased the
 
05:22:01.990 --> 05:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
time I had to qualify so it was a
 
05:22:04.830 --> 05:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest for me that I think
 
05:22:07.270 --> 05:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
maybe to put this in before that but now
 
05:22:09.310 --> 05:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
that it's it's been forgiven and I don't
 
05:22:10.830 --> 05:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
any longer have a dog in the
 
05:22:12.788 --> 05:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
fight any other
 
05:22:17.470 --> 05:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:20.190 --> 05:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
much and I will call the clerk of the
 
05:22:27.510 --> 05:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
Smith good afternoon long time to see um
 
05:22:34.190 --> 05:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
Paul Smith Clerk of the house just here
 
05:22:36.510 --> 05:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh to provide a couple of uh points of
 
05:22:36.520 --> 05:22:37.270 align:start position:0%
uh to provide a couple of uh points of
of

05:22:37.270 --> 05:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:22:40.030 --> 05:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
clarification um again uh as
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Reed said there's two
 
05:22:43.948 --> 05:22:43.958 align:start position:0%
components of the bill um I have nothing
 
05:22:45.868 --> 05:22:45.878 align:start position:0%
to say whatsoever about the second
 
05:22:48.788 --> 05:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
component um I'm I'm here just to talk
 
05:22:50.430 --> 05:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
specifically about the
 
05:22:55.150 --> 05:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
pslf um and and the reason for that is
 
05:22:58.670 --> 05:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
um as as you all know um I have
 
05:23:00.470 --> 05:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues across the country there's 99
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
of us um there's not a 100 because
 
05:23:06.670 --> 05:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
Nebraska is unicam legislature so um
 
05:23:08.510 --> 05:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
that being said uh you know we
 
05:23:11.070 --> 05:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
communicate on various issues um between
 
05:23:13.590 --> 05:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
the states uh when we're looking for
 
05:23:16.350 --> 05:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
information um they they just recently
 
05:23:17.948 --> 05:23:17.958 align:start position:0%
uh sent me a request asking about
 
05:23:20.030 --> 05:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
members desks and I I got a little
 
05:23:21.868 --> 05:23:21.878 align:start position:0%
chuckled because you know you don't get
 
05:23:25.910 --> 05:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
any of those um so I uh in turn asked
 
05:23:31.070 --> 05:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
the question about pslf um and uh I I I
 
05:23:33.270 --> 05:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
didn't receive responses from everybody
 
05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
because not everybody participates um
 
05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
however um I did receive uh a slew of
 
05:23:42.990 --> 05:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
responses um and just as a as a brief
 
05:23:47.788 --> 05:23:47.798 align:start position:0%
snapshot um although the term employment
 
05:23:51.150 --> 05:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
is is sort of a contention a contentious
 
05:23:54.948 --> 05:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
issue here um in terms of service
 
05:23:57.110 --> 05:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
because this is Public service loan
 
05:24:00.070 --> 05:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
forgiveness uh in terms of service that
 
05:24:02.708 --> 05:24:02.718 align:start position:0%
counts uh the following states reported
 
05:24:06.030 --> 05:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
to me that they do count the service
 
05:24:08.910 --> 05:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
towards uh the pslf uh
 
05:24:13.628 --> 05:24:13.638 align:start position:0%
program um so Florida Maine Hawaii
 
05:24:16.430 --> 05:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont Pennsylvania
 
05:24:20.548 --> 05:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
Virginia um Kansas Alabama Washington
 
05:24:24.708 --> 05:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
Minnesota Texas uh California Wyoming in
 
05:24:27.150 --> 05:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
Louisiana um all reported to me that
 
05:24:30.948 --> 05:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
they do participate in pslf um in terms
 
05:24:34.708 --> 05:24:34.718 align:start position:0%
of certifying their members Service as
 
05:24:38.190 --> 05:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh as it counts towards uh the program
 
05:24:42.150 --> 05:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh two states of that group of of that
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
responded responded no and that would be
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
Kentucky and New Mexico now
 
05:24:48.310 --> 05:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
interestingly New Mexico does not pay
 
05:24:50.990 --> 05:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
their members at all uh they have a
 
05:24:53.110 --> 05:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
perdum but they do not have a
 
05:24:56.948 --> 05:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
legislative salary whatsoever um so we
 
05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
often comment about being the lowest
 
05:25:01.708 --> 05:25:01.718 align:start position:0%
paid in the country uh but New Mexico
 
05:25:03.670 --> 05:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
they whenever I'm at an ncsl meeting
 
05:25:05.750 --> 05:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
they like to chime in and say oh no no
 
05:25:08.910 --> 05:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're the we're the least okay um
 
05:25:12.670 --> 05:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
but uh but anyway uh just so just for I
 
05:25:15.548 --> 05:25:15.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to present that because again um
 
05:25:18.470 --> 05:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
in a few of these cases as well um the
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
clerk uh certifies I know in this this
 
05:25:23.230 --> 05:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
legislation uh it's written that the
 
05:25:27.150 --> 05:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
clerk is to certify these these forms um
 
05:25:30.788 --> 05:25:30.798 align:start position:0%
I myself um after uh 20 years after I
 
05:25:33.030 --> 05:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
graduated college um I had the last
 
05:25:35.670 --> 05:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
$44,000 of my student loans forgiven via
 
05:25:39.190 --> 05:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
pslf I was grateful for that um but I
 
05:25:40.590 --> 05:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
did go through
 
05:25:44.190 --> 05:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
rgo um for that for that practice
 
05:25:45.868 --> 05:25:45.878 align:start position:0%
however in several of these states the
 
05:25:49.390 --> 05:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
clerk does certify um on behalf of of
 
05:25:49.400 --> 05:25:50.270 align:start position:0%
clerk does certify um on behalf of of
the

05:25:50.270 --> 05:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:25:52.628 --> 05:25:52.638 align:start position:0%
legislators um so that's I just wanted
 
05:25:54.788 --> 05:25:54.798 align:start position:0%
to give you sort of a snapshot as as to
 
05:25:57.750 --> 05:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
how the program um is run and again uh
 
05:25:58.948 --> 05:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
representative Wade asked the question
 
05:26:00.750 --> 05:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
earlier about legislation I I believe it
 
05:26:05.150 --> 05:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
has been sort of um uh a decision of the
 
05:26:06.910 --> 05:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
sort of chief administrative officers
 
05:26:09.750 --> 05:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
with their HR folks that uh they came to
 
05:26:12.510 --> 05:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
that decision on their own um about the
 
05:26:13.990 --> 05:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
service because again it's not about
 
05:26:16.670 --> 05:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
employment it's about the service um
 
05:26:20.948 --> 05:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
because uh you know you can you can
 
05:26:20.958 --> 05:26:22.708 align:start position:0%
because uh you know you can you can
you're

05:26:22.708 --> 05:26:22.718 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:26:27.270 --> 05:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh you could essentially um well I I'll
 
05:26:29.390 --> 05:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
just call it that it's it's the service
 
05:26:32.110 --> 05:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
that that counts in that um in that
 
05:26:32.120 --> 05:26:33.628 align:start position:0%
that that counts in that um in that
respect

05:26:33.628 --> 05:26:33.638 align:start position:0%
respect
 
05:26:35.708 --> 05:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your testimony are
 
05:26:37.230 --> 05:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
there any
 
05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
questions R um just quick question so um
 
05:26:45.510 --> 05:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
from what you just said uh it's the
 
05:26:48.190 --> 05:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
service that's at issue um for the
 
05:26:50.430 --> 05:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
reason for denying some of these claims
 
05:26:53.868 --> 05:26:53.878 align:start position:0%
so in your view does this
 
05:26:57.910 --> 05:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
legislation um would would that fix that
 
05:27:00.150 --> 05:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh because it's a federally administered
 
05:27:04.548 --> 05:27:04.558 align:start position:0%
program right um so would this state
 
05:27:08.190 --> 05:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
law actually work as intended um for
 
05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
from your understanding uh I think so um
 
05:27:14.548 --> 05:27:14.558 align:start position:0%
certainly um that you know by by stating
 
05:27:17.628 --> 05:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
the position of uh that that you all as
 
05:27:19.628 --> 05:27:19.638 align:start position:0%
the legislative body believe this is
 
05:27:21.150 --> 05:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
important enough to count for this
 
05:27:23.708 --> 05:27:23.718 align:start position:0%
program uh it it certainly gives
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
direction to the legislative staff but
 
05:27:28.868 --> 05:27:28.878 align:start position:0%
because this one actually um directs me
 
05:27:31.830 --> 05:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
to fill out the form you know I I would
 
05:27:34.830 --> 05:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
take the message loud and
 
05:27:38.310 --> 05:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
clear representative P thank you madam
 
05:27:42.270 --> 05:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
chair um so the list of states that you
 
05:27:45.670 --> 05:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned did they pass a law to have
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
their legislators qualify or did they
 
05:27:51.910 --> 05:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
just do it right so as I mentioned uh in
 
05:27:53.030 --> 05:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
response to representative Wade's
 
05:27:54.670 --> 05:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
question I believe that in many of these
 
05:27:56.390 --> 05:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
cases it was sort of a determination by
 
05:27:59.310 --> 05:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
their cheap administrative uh folks um
 
05:28:02.590 --> 05:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
to to process these on their own without
 
05:28:05.628 --> 05:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
legislation okay I I think the rationale
 
05:28:08.948 --> 05:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
here is because um because there's this
 
05:28:10.510 --> 05:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
question and and and it is a
 
05:28:12.948 --> 05:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
long-standing question um I I want to
 
05:28:14.750 --> 05:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
make it clear that before the pslf
 
05:28:19.030 --> 05:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
program began um there's always been um
 
05:28:21.350 --> 05:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
we've had we've had members uh that used
 
05:28:23.310 --> 05:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
to appear before this committee a lot
 
05:28:24.830 --> 05:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
when they were alive representative
 
05:28:26.910 --> 05:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
marpel for example that used to talk
 
05:28:28.190 --> 05:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
about the fact that he was not an
 
05:28:30.150 --> 05:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
employee and that's why he deserved to
 
05:28:32.230 --> 05:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
be paid his compensation in gold and
 
05:28:34.430 --> 05:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
silver and and that sort of thing uh
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
because he was an elected official um so
 
05:28:39.270 --> 05:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
so that argument has been around a very
 
05:28:42.590 --> 05:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
long time and I think that's why uh gcio
 
05:28:45.230 --> 05:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh has sort of uh Gone by that that
 
05:28:48.190 --> 05:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
long-standing provision but setting a uh
 
05:28:51.110 --> 05:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
setting the the position uh in law that
 
05:28:53.030 --> 05:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
this this does count I I think that
 
05:28:57.788 --> 05:28:57.798 align:start position:0%
addresses that just follow please so the
 
05:28:59.788 --> 05:28:59.798 align:start position:0%
administrators of the general
 
05:29:02.190 --> 05:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
court could they just reconvene and
 
05:29:04.350 --> 05:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
reassess without us pass having to pass
 
05:29:06.350 --> 05:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
a law I
 
05:29:10.470 --> 05:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
I I I'm my best advice to you is that if
 
05:29:12.070 --> 05:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh that that would be a very good
 
05:29:13.788 --> 05:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
conversation for you to have uh with
 
05:29:15.628 --> 05:29:15.638 align:start position:0%
those folks however based on the
 
05:29:19.390 --> 05:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
precedent of of of Prior decisions um I
 
05:29:25.030 --> 05:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:28.628 --> 05:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
likely okay any other questions seeing
 
05:29:32.310 --> 05:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
none thank you oh rep wall
 
05:29:34.948 --> 05:29:34.958 align:start position:0%
sorry much M Madam
 
05:29:37.548 --> 05:29:37.558 align:start position:0%
chairman so are there penalties in other
 
05:29:40.070 --> 05:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
states if employers don't allow this
 
05:29:40.080 --> 05:29:41.190 align:start position:0%
states if employers don't allow this
time

05:29:41.190 --> 05:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:29:45.150 --> 05:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
off uh so I'm I'm not talking about that
 
05:29:48.708 --> 05:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
part of the bill um I truly have nothing
 
05:29:52.030 --> 05:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
to say about that that's entirely uh I I
 
05:29:55.110 --> 05:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't asked to to look at that and I'm
 
05:29:55.120 --> 05:29:56.590 align:start position:0%
wasn't asked to to look at that and I'm
that's

05:29:56.590 --> 05:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:29:59.270 --> 05:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay

thank you madam chairman members of the

committee uh my name is John garan I am

general counsel at the Department of
 
05:30:23.190 --> 05:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
Labor um the department is neutral on
 
05:30:24.548 --> 05:30:24.558 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm just here to provide some
 
05:30:27.270 --> 05:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
information um really on the enforcement
 
05:30:30.510 --> 05:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
piece um for the employment um or the
 
05:30:32.470 --> 05:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
the non- discharge part I I we don't
 
05:30:34.910 --> 05:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
take any position on Public service loan
 
05:30:37.350 --> 05:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
forgiveness um just so you're aware um
 
05:30:39.990 --> 05:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
under our laws under RSA
 
05:30:45.548 --> 05:30:45.558 align:start position:0%
27311 a um a violation of of of this
 
05:30:47.670 --> 05:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
proposed language here that would result
 
05:30:49.868 --> 05:30:49.878 align:start position:0%
uh for a first time in a warning um with
 
05:30:51.430 --> 05:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
30 days to correct and then any
 
05:30:52.830 --> 05:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
subsequent violations could be
 
05:30:55.708 --> 05:30:55.718 align:start position:0%
punishable by up to a $2500 civil
 
05:30:58.430 --> 05:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
penalty um I had come before the
 
05:31:00.110 --> 05:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
committee a few weeks back and
 
05:31:02.670 --> 05:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
previously testified on HB 347 which is
 
05:31:06.548 --> 05:31:06.558 align:start position:0%
a very similar bill um the testimony we
 
05:31:08.590 --> 05:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
had on that bill was
 
05:31:12.470 --> 05:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh that bill was seeking to amend RSA 14
 
05:31:16.070 --> 05:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
UHA and our our our position was that we
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
needed um language amended into that
 
05:31:19.990 --> 05:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill in order to give us authority to
 
05:31:21.868 --> 05:31:21.878 align:start position:0%
not just penalize but to also
 
05:31:24.590 --> 05:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
investigate um and to look into these
 
05:31:29.110 --> 05:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
instances um this bill HB 605 um takes a
 
05:31:30.910 --> 05:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
different tack it actually includes the
 
05:31:34.830 --> 05:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
violation within RC 275 which is our
 
05:31:37.910 --> 05:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
kind of main protective legislation uh
 
05:31:40.230 --> 05:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
statute at the Department of Labor um as
 
05:31:43.190 --> 05:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
such this bill we feel actually properly
 
05:31:45.150 --> 05:31:45.160 align:start position:0%
has an investigative Authority and the
 
05:31:46.708 --> 05:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
penalty Authority in it so we don't have
 
05:31:48.910 --> 05:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
any technical corrections to suggest on
 
05:31:50.628 --> 05:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
that front I just want to clarify the
 
05:31:52.270 --> 05:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
difference in position between those two
 
05:31:54.430 --> 05:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
bills um so this language addresses all
 
05:31:56.788 --> 05:31:56.798 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we had raised with HB
 
05:32:02.150 --> 05:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:05.070 --> 05:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative P thank you
 
05:32:08.310 --> 05:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair did you just say 275 because
 
05:32:11.310 --> 05:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
I I'm reading 270 oh wait a minute now I
 
05:32:14.390 --> 05:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
thought I said 273 no yes can you
 
05:32:17.070 --> 05:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
clarify 275 versus 273 yeah absolutely
 
05:32:19.510 --> 05:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh RC 273 is the establishing
 
05:32:21.708 --> 05:32:21.718 align:start position:0%
statute for the Department of Labor um
 
05:32:23.110 --> 05:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
I'll back up one step the Department of
 
05:32:25.590 --> 05:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
Labor administers a lot of statutes um
 
05:32:27.830 --> 05:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
one of that happens to be RC 273 that's
 
05:32:29.510 --> 05:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
our kind of establishing statute that's
 
05:32:31.590 --> 05:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
the kind of core um it's a very old
 
05:32:34.670 --> 05:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
statute goes back to 1911 um and some
 
05:32:36.628 --> 05:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
instances goes back to 1894 when the
 
05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
department was founded um among the
 
05:32:42.990 --> 05:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
statutes we administer RSA 275 contains
 
05:32:44.230 --> 05:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
I think what most people would typically
 
05:32:46.470 --> 05:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
think of as like the wage and hour laws
 
05:32:48.750 --> 05:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
like you've got to get paid on time um
 
05:32:50.110 --> 05:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
employers are only allowed to deduct
 
05:32:52.990 --> 05:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
certain things that sort of stuff so
 
05:32:56.030 --> 05:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
this um this bill would propose adding
 
05:32:59.548 --> 05:32:59.558 align:start position:0%
this right to leave work within that um
 
05:33:02.628 --> 05:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
that statutory construction um that's a
 
05:33:04.548 --> 05:33:04.558 align:start position:0%
statutory area that we do a lot of work
 
05:33:07.510 --> 05:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
in we have a lot of jurisdiction over so
 
05:33:09.110 --> 05:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
um with that Clarity in that this would
 
05:33:11.310 --> 05:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
be an RSA 275 as opposed to trying to
 
05:33:13.628 --> 05:33:13.638 align:start position:0%
amend rsa1 14a which the department has
 
05:33:17.230 --> 05:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
no otherwise authority over rsa1 14a um
 
05:33:19.510 --> 05:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
we feel that this would be a um a proper
 
05:33:21.190 --> 05:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
kind of a good place for it if if the
 
05:33:22.470 --> 05:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
intent was to have the department
 
05:33:27.350 --> 05:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
provision any other questions from the
 
05:33:32.470 --> 05:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
05:33:34.990 --> 05:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony and we have no
 
05:33:37.070 --> 05:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
other pink cards so I will close the
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:36.628 --> 05:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:36.638 --> 05:35:06.628 align:start position:0%
 
there's

05:35:06.628 --> 05:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:40.868 --> 05:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:44.470 --> 05:35:44.480 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:37:10.590 --> 05:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:14.350 --> 05:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
it's a Well oil machine today we've got
 
05:37:14.360 --> 05:37:16.270 align:start position:0%
it's a Well oil machine today we've got
going

05:37:16.270 --> 05:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
going
 
05:37:19.948 --> 05:37:19.958 align:start position:0%
um I will U pass on some information for
 
05:37:19.958 --> 05:37:21.350 align:start position:0%
um I will U pass on some information for
you

05:37:21.350 --> 05:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:37:27.628 --> 05:37:27.638 align:start position:0%
um from what I know um this bill deals
 
05:37:27.638 --> 05:37:29.548 align:start position:0%
um from what I know um this bill deals
with

05:37:29.548 --> 05:37:29.558 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:37:33.788 --> 05:37:33.798 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire Supreme Court and
 
05:37:33.798 --> 05:37:35.628 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire Supreme Court and
their

05:37:35.628 --> 05:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:37:38.030 --> 05:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:37:41.590 --> 05:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
decision to put uh one of the justices
 
05:37:43.868 --> 05:37:43.878 align:start position:0%
on I'm not even sure if this is the
 
05:37:46.628 --> 05:37:46.638 align:start position:0%
right term pay leave or something like
 
05:37:51.750 --> 05:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
that um so the question is
 
05:37:56.390 --> 05:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
whether the court has that ability and
 
05:37:59.590 --> 05:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
to what extent does that
 
05:38:04.990 --> 05:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
ability as it goes longer does that
 
05:38:08.230 --> 05:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
um turn into a virtual I'm making this
 
05:38:12.030 --> 05:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
up a virtual impeachment of that of that
 
05:38:14.670 --> 05:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
Justice because by
 
05:38:18.788 --> 05:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional um analysis or reading
 
05:38:21.470 --> 05:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
only the legislature has that ability to
 
05:38:21.480 --> 05:38:22.910 align:start position:0%
only the legislature has that ability to
do

05:38:22.910 --> 05:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:38:22.920 --> 05:38:24.948 align:start position:0%
do
impeachments

05:38:24.948 --> 05:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
impeachments
 
05:38:30.750 --> 05:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
so that's the gist of what this is
 
05:38:33.590 --> 05:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
about layered on top of that is the
 
05:38:37.270 --> 05:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
concern of mine that house resolutions
 
05:38:40.708 --> 05:38:40.718 align:start position:0%
as as we've learned from last term um
 
05:38:44.590 --> 05:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
house resolutions only are dealt with in
 
05:38:49.230 --> 05:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
the house they don't go to the Senate
 
05:38:53.350 --> 05:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of um I'm not sure what
 
05:38:55.910 --> 05:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
this is going to accomplish the last
 
05:38:58.190 --> 05:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
piece that I'll give you and explain to
 
05:39:00.190 --> 05:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
you that you'll be receiving an email
 
05:39:03.468 --> 05:39:03.478 align:start position:0%
from me is some information that I
 
05:39:03.478 --> 05:39:04.750 align:start position:0%
from me is some information that I
received

05:39:04.750 --> 05:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
received
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
from um attorney Cy house councel that
 
05:39:15.190 --> 05:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
um refers to a case um in New Hampshire
 
05:39:17.910 --> 05:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
where the court in their decision
 
05:39:23.510 --> 05:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
discussed this this concern of um does
 
05:39:27.230 --> 05:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
the court have room to discipline and at
 
05:39:29.430 --> 05:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
what point does discipline turn into
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
something other than discipline and um
 
05:39:36.150 --> 05:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
so I will provide all of that
 
05:39:41.110 --> 05:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
information for you and we will use it
 
05:39:44.548 --> 05:39:44.558 align:start position:0%
at some point um for the exact session
 
05:39:47.390 --> 05:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm hopeful that the prime
 
05:39:50.990 --> 05:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor um recovers and is able to speak
 
05:39:53.190 --> 05:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
for himself I I will certainly provide
 
05:39:55.948 --> 05:39:55.958 align:start position:0%
him some time if we need it during the
 
05:39:59.708 --> 05:39:59.718 align:start position:0%
exec session but um but he is the only
 
05:40:01.868 --> 05:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
sponsor as you see on here and it makes
 
05:40:05.708 --> 05:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
it awfully difficult for us um so um as
 
05:40:07.868 --> 05:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
it stands that's where it stands right
 
05:40:10.750 --> 05:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
now and that's about all I can tell you
 
05:40:13.628 --> 05:40:13.638 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm going to close the
 
05:40:15.788 --> 05:40:15.798 align:start position:0%
house resolution
 
05:40:20.750 --> 05:40:20.760 align:start position:0%

05:41:32.468 --> 05:41:32.478 align:start position:0%
explanation here um this committee
 
05:41:33.868 --> 05:41:33.878 align:start position:0%
especially for those that are not
 
05:41:37.230 --> 05:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with this committee um I don't
 
05:41:38.788 --> 05:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
don't know how many years we've done
 
05:41:41.708 --> 05:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
this um started with the original four
 
05:41:44.430 --> 05:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
with the original comcom committees back
 
05:41:47.868 --> 05:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
um with a a prior researcher that we had
 
05:41:52.670 --> 05:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
U who was brilliant named Pam smling um
 
05:41:54.230 --> 05:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:41:57.670 --> 05:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
within our house RSA Our House and
 
05:41:57.680 --> 05:41:58.510 align:start position:0%
within our house RSA Our House and
Senate

05:41:58.510 --> 05:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
05:42:00.628 --> 05:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
rsas somewhere in the neighborhood of
 
05:42:03.868 --> 05:42:03.878 align:start position:0%
three to 400 committees and commissions
 
05:42:07.830 --> 05:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
um it's a daunting task to
 
05:42:13.110 --> 05:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
um to staff or to um what's the word I'm
 
05:42:17.468 --> 05:42:17.478 align:start position:0%
looking for um popul populate um those
 
05:42:20.548 --> 05:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
uh those committees and commissions and
 
05:42:25.390 --> 05:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
in the process um our Deputy um speaker
 
05:42:27.868 --> 05:42:27.878 align:start position:0%
uh assistant Deputy speaker comes across
 
05:42:31.708 --> 05:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
ones that need to be have either outlive
 
05:42:34.830 --> 05:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
their usefulness and never were drafted
 
05:42:37.270 --> 05:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh with an expiration date attached to
 
05:42:41.310 --> 05:42:41.320 align:start position:0%
them or um they have not met in years
 
05:42:44.350 --> 05:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
and and no one can decide whether they
 
05:42:47.468 --> 05:42:47.478 align:start position:0%
need to be uh in existence any longer
 
05:42:50.628 --> 05:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
and so we end up with this list in this
 
05:42:54.468 --> 05:42:54.478 align:start position:0%
case of 10 or 11 I think something like
 
05:42:57.990 --> 05:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
that of of
 
05:42:58.000 --> 05:43:00.030 align:start position:0%
that of of
um

05:43:00.030 --> 05:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:02.030 --> 05:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
suggested um
 
05:43:07.230 --> 05:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
repeals and so this is a hearing to um
 
05:43:11.070 --> 05:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
hear from anyone that would like to
 
05:43:13.830 --> 05:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
speak about um any of these committees
 
05:43:16.948 --> 05:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
or commissions and whether or not uh
 
05:43:20.910 --> 05:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
they should be removed um from
 
05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
consideration for uh for continued
 
05:43:30.350 --> 05:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
Staffing or um populating so uh with
 
05:43:32.110 --> 05:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
that that's about all I can tell you
 
05:43:35.468 --> 05:43:35.478 align:start position:0%
about it and uh with that I'm I
 
05:43:37.868 --> 05:43:37.878 align:start position:0%
have these are the two that were up
 
05:43:41.548 --> 05:43:41.558 align:start position:0%
there was that right so I have two U
 
05:43:50.070 --> 05:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:52.750 --> 05:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
Maryanne can I correct some of the this
 
05:43:55.510 --> 05:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
so that it um might it can get into the
 
05:43:59.150 --> 05:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
record barter it is b a r t r yes thank

you okay um if you'd like I can Shannon
 
05:44:03.230 --> 05:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
Trembley to join me and then you could
 
05:44:05.948 --> 05:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
get us both done at once uh no uh we're
 
05:44:10.510 --> 05:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
fine go as we go um you are with the New
 
05:44:12.868 --> 05:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Child Care advisory Council
 
05:44:17.868 --> 05:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
yes I'm currently the chair Okay C chair
 
05:44:21.190 --> 05:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
um welcome to legislative Administration
 
05:44:21.200 --> 05:44:22.230 align:start position:0%
um welcome to legislative Administration
and

05:44:22.230 --> 05:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:44:25.150 --> 05:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
uh tell us about your organization thank
 
05:44:27.270 --> 05:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
you so um we were surprised to see
 
05:44:29.150 --> 05:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
ourselves on this list because we have
 
05:44:31.628 --> 05:44:31.638 align:start position:0%
been very busy and very vibrin for
 
05:44:33.990 --> 05:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
several years well for decades now uh
 
05:44:36.350 --> 05:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
the childcare advisory Council meets um
 
05:44:38.510 --> 05:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
six times a year year we have a voting
 
05:44:41.150 --> 05:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
membership of voting and non non- voting
 
05:44:44.150 --> 05:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
members we have we get reports from DHHS
 
05:44:46.030 --> 05:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
and from the Department of Education and
 
05:44:48.150 --> 05:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
then we report back with suggestions
 
05:44:51.868 --> 05:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
that might um or we advise on anything
 
05:44:54.750 --> 05:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
that might impede access to child care
 
05:44:57.708 --> 05:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
Statewide so when I think of the child
 
05:45:00.430 --> 05:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
care advisory Council I really think of
 
05:45:03.030 --> 05:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
a group of people who are trying to do
 
05:45:04.868 --> 05:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
what's best for the children trying to
 
05:45:06.670 --> 05:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that parents have access to
 
05:45:08.468 --> 05:45:08.478 align:start position:0%
child care and try to make sure the
 
05:45:11.110 --> 05:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
childcare providers remain open vibrant
 
05:45:14.510 --> 05:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
and serving their communities so what we
 
05:45:16.350 --> 05:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
have really done over the last several
 
05:45:18.788 --> 05:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
years during the pandemic is make sure
 
05:45:20.788 --> 05:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
that the child care providers are aware
 
05:45:22.190 --> 05:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
of all the different options that are
 
05:45:23.948 --> 05:45:23.958 align:start position:0%
open to them the different funds that
 
05:45:25.868 --> 05:45:25.878 align:start position:0%
are available um different ways to
 
05:45:27.708 --> 05:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
access these funds and we've also
 
05:45:29.590 --> 05:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
reached out to DHHS and the Department
 
05:45:31.468 --> 05:45:31.478 align:start position:0%
of Education about any information or
 
05:45:34.670 --> 05:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
anything pending that might impede the
 
05:45:37.030 --> 05:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
ability to provide child care and I will
 
05:45:38.830 --> 05:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
use as an example of some of the work
 
05:45:41.030 --> 05:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
we've just finished is the childcare
 
05:45:43.868 --> 05:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
advisory Council convened a group of 11
 
05:45:46.350 --> 05:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
child care providers to work with um
 
05:45:50.150 --> 05:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
DHHS dhs's licensing childcare Licensing
 
05:45:52.430 --> 05:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau to get together and to go through
 
05:45:54.468 --> 05:45:54.478 align:start position:0%
the rules line by line it took us almost
 
05:45:56.628 --> 05:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
a year it was an incredible process but
 
05:45:58.548 --> 05:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
to streamline the rules to make it
 
05:46:00.990 --> 05:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
possible for child care providers to
 
05:46:02.750 --> 05:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
continue to provide care in the state
 
05:46:05.708 --> 05:46:05.718 align:start position:0%
and not be so overburdened by regulation
 
05:46:08.310 --> 05:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
um it is a heavily regulated industry
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about kids safety we want
 
05:46:11.910 --> 05:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure the childcare licensing
 
05:46:13.628 --> 05:46:13.638 align:start position:0%
rules are about children's safety and
 
05:46:16.390 --> 05:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
not hidden quality agendas or hidden
 
05:46:18.510 --> 05:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
other agendas uh that would impede
 
05:46:21.510 --> 05:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
access uh we do have to rep present a
 
05:46:23.190 --> 05:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
report to the house oversight committee
 
05:46:25.468 --> 05:46:25.478 align:start position:0%
once a year we did that in June and I do
 
05:46:32.070 --> 05:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:34.590 --> 05:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
it yes I really don't unless anyone has
 
05:46:38.310 --> 05:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:41.830 --> 05:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair do you have any idea
 
05:46:43.948 --> 05:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
or does anyone have any idea how you
 
05:46:46.788 --> 05:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
your group ended up on this list no I
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
wish I knew I mean we we don't we don't
 
05:46:51.150 --> 05:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
know I
 
05:46:53.270 --> 05:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
mean sometimes in doing our work we
 
05:46:53.280 --> 05:46:55.070 align:start position:0%
mean sometimes in doing our work we
irritate

05:46:55.070 --> 05:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
irritate
 
05:47:00.230 --> 05:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
people okay so I might be able to shed a
 
05:47:02.948 --> 05:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
little light
 
05:47:06.030 --> 05:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
um first off um can I ask how many
 
05:47:07.948 --> 05:47:07.958 align:start position:0%
voting members and how many non- voting
 
05:47:10.030 --> 05:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
members you have I would defer that to
 
05:47:11.390 --> 05:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
Shannon she's the director of the
 
05:47:13.788 --> 05:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
childcare advisory
 
05:47:17.910 --> 05:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
Council yeah off the top of her head
 
05:47:20.350 --> 05:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
18ish it's not a very tight committee
 
05:47:21.868 --> 05:47:21.878 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm going to be honest we have
 
05:47:24.948 --> 05:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
not looked at our bylaw since
 
05:47:28.750 --> 05:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
2002 2011 and the world of child care
 
05:47:30.708 --> 05:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
has changed dramatically in that period
 
05:47:32.830 --> 05:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
of time um we are currently going
 
05:47:34.750 --> 05:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
through the strategic planning process
 
05:47:37.750 --> 05:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
we hired a consultant from St an College
 
05:47:40.788 --> 05:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
to interview stakeholders interview
 
05:47:42.990 --> 05:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
members of um the childcare advisory
 
05:47:45.430 --> 05:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
Council different Community leaders to
 
05:47:49.030 --> 05:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
kind of understand how the childcare
 
05:47:51.110 --> 05:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
advisory Council can serve communities
 
05:47:54.548 --> 05:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
today and serve the the state today um a
 
05:47:57.190 --> 05:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
perfect example of the change in the
 
05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
childcare advisory council is for the
 
05:48:00.270 --> 05:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
very first time we have someone from the
 
05:48:02.590 --> 05:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
Bia who's attending our meetings because
 
05:48:04.510 --> 05:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
we know the future of child care is
 
05:48:06.910 --> 05:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
child care providers providing a service
 
05:48:09.548 --> 05:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
so employers can have employees and
 
05:48:11.590 --> 05:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
building that close relationship will
 
05:48:13.868 --> 05:48:13.878 align:start position:0%
really and formalizing that close
 
05:48:16.070 --> 05:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
relationship will benefit both the
 
05:48:18.990 --> 05:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
Employers in the state and child care
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
facilities thank you um I have read your
 
05:48:26.430 --> 05:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
bylaws um and and a couple of the things
 
05:48:29.910 --> 05:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
that I think may have triggered this and
 
05:48:32.150 --> 05:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
and I again I'm only making this up but
 
05:48:35.070 --> 05:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to answer your question
 
05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
um in in the voting members there is one
 
05:48:43.070 --> 05:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
um representative and one
 
05:48:43.080 --> 05:48:44.590 align:start position:0%
um representative and one
Senator

05:48:44.590 --> 05:48:44.600 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
05:48:48.030 --> 05:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
um but there's a number of voting
 
05:48:51.708 --> 05:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
members within this organization so from
 
05:48:54.628 --> 05:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
I think from this perspective there's
 
05:48:59.150 --> 05:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
not very much input from the legislative
 
05:49:01.310 --> 05:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
side of things so the question is why
 
05:49:05.230 --> 05:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
are we having a um a
 
05:49:10.030 --> 05:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
legislative enact did study committee um
 
05:49:14.310 --> 05:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
when it's not really legislatively
 
05:49:17.190 --> 05:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
driven this so I think part of the
 
05:49:21.190 --> 05:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
question and and again this is this is
 
05:49:23.390 --> 05:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
supposition on my part part of the
 
05:49:25.270 --> 05:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
question is does this
 
05:49:29.830 --> 05:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
operate um if there if those two line
 
05:49:32.548 --> 05:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
items one for house and one for Senate
 
05:49:35.270 --> 05:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't participate and could
 
05:49:38.750 --> 05:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
everything still operate the way it does
 
05:49:42.990 --> 05:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
outside with them um determining any
 
05:49:47.110 --> 05:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
changes and them reporting back to um
 
05:49:50.910 --> 05:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
either DHHS or HHS or or children and
 
05:49:54.350 --> 05:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
family law or whoever it is without the
 
05:49:58.110 --> 05:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
the input of the legislator of the
 
05:50:00.628 --> 05:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
yep uh thank you Mr chair for my
 
05:50:05.350 --> 05:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
question would that be why in this uh
 
05:50:06.708 --> 05:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
the language of all the different
 
05:50:10.750 --> 05:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
different lines that we have um there's
 
05:50:15.990 --> 05:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
relative to and in this instance um and
 
05:50:18.670 --> 05:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
then there's also relative to the
 
05:50:23.270 --> 05:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
repeal and so therefore underline eight
 
05:50:26.030 --> 05:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
on page two it says relative to The
 
05:50:28.670 --> 05:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
Advisory Council on child care but it
 
05:50:32.548 --> 05:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
does not say relative to the repeal so
 
05:50:34.310 --> 05:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
therefore it's seeking that further
 
05:50:34.320 --> 05:50:37.270 align:start position:0%
therefore it's seeking that further
clarification

05:50:37.270 --> 05:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
05:50:38.270 --> 05:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:50:41.750 --> 05:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
it yeah I I I think this is almost
 
05:50:43.468 --> 05:50:43.478 align:start position:0%
turning into a work session here and
 
05:50:45.430 --> 05:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
we're trying to piece it together and
 
05:50:47.628 --> 05:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure are repealed yeah it
 
05:50:50.628 --> 05:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
does have the repeal okay thank you but
 
05:50:52.590 --> 05:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not
 
05:50:55.868 --> 05:50:55.878 align:start position:0%
um um I'm not
 
05:51:00.510 --> 05:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
entirely certain of my Spiel a minute
 
05:51:06.110 --> 05:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
ago um but I also will say that um uh
 
05:51:08.708 --> 05:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
we've got two extraordinary things the
 
05:51:12.868 --> 05:51:12.878 align:start position:0%
two people that know most about this um
 
05:51:15.788 --> 05:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
and we don't plan on um voting on this
 
05:51:19.628 --> 05:51:19.638 align:start position:0%
or anything today thank you but um but
 
05:51:23.468 --> 05:51:23.478 align:start position:0%
the two people um coincidentally uh with
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
the the last qu are all part of either
 
05:51:29.788 --> 05:51:29.798 align:start position:0%
in the hospital are have been sick all
 
05:51:34.190 --> 05:51:34.200 align:start position:0%

having to um exec up in Edna her second
 
05:51:42.270 --> 05:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
committee so the the people um that know
 
05:51:45.030 --> 05:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
most about this aren't here so um we're
 
05:51:47.750 --> 05:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
kind of at a loss we're kind of working
 
05:51:49.670 --> 05:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
on on
 
05:51:52.070 --> 05:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
supposition representative wall thank
 
05:51:54.190 --> 05:51:54.200 align:start position:0%

05:53:17.510 --> 05:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:21.190 --> 05:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair um so you stated
 
05:53:23.190 --> 05:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
that there is one house rep and one
 
05:53:25.270 --> 05:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
Senator on your committees do they
 
05:53:28.230 --> 05:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
attend the six meetings a year I'd love
 
05:53:29.948 --> 05:53:29.958 align:start position:0%
to say they do but they do not um
 
05:53:32.190 --> 05:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley was very active on our
 
05:53:34.070 --> 05:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
committee and she did attend during her
 
05:53:36.190 --> 05:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
tenure um we haven't had luck getting a
 
05:53:38.830 --> 05:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
leg getting a house representative to
 
05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
attend in quite a long
 
05:53:42.430 --> 05:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
time part
 
05:53:45.910 --> 05:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
of part of that my understanding is I
 
05:53:49.270 --> 05:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
think your meetings are Thursdays yes um
 
05:53:52.430 --> 05:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
oh yes we have a which is a house
 
05:53:56.510 --> 05:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
session day um so um to be fair it
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't it you know just to explain a
 
05:54:00.910 --> 05:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
little bit why Thursdays may not or
 
05:54:03.750 --> 05:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
attendance may not be what you had
 
05:54:07.390 --> 05:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
hoped um
 
05:54:11.030 --> 05:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
but again I think part of it is not c
 
05:54:14.468 --> 05:54:14.478 align:start position:0%
not certain whether there's a
 
05:54:17.390 --> 05:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
need um representative shott you had a
 
05:54:19.750 --> 05:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
question I
 
05:54:22.868 --> 05:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
did thank you Mr chairman uh just one
 
05:54:24.590 --> 05:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
quick Point somebody was asking about on
 
05:54:26.910 --> 05:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
line 25 on the first page it talks about
 
05:54:29.788 --> 05:54:29.798 align:start position:0%
repeal the following are repealed and I
 
05:54:32.030 --> 05:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
would agree the way it's written when
 
05:54:33.910 --> 05:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
you get towards the back they're talking
 
05:54:33.920 --> 05:54:34.948 align:start position:0%
you get towards the back they're talking
about

05:54:34.948 --> 05:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:54:37.948 --> 05:54:37.958 align:start position:0%
repeals I don't know if we're repealing
 
05:54:40.628 --> 05:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
a repeal or what's going on so I think
 
05:54:43.590 --> 05:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
there's that needs to be looked at um to
 
05:54:45.708 --> 05:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
the speaker um did you say you were the
 
05:54:48.548 --> 05:54:48.558 align:start position:0%

05:56:04.190 --> 05:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
doing can I be very candid um it's just
 
05:56:07.030 --> 05:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
us here the YouTube
 
05:56:10.708 --> 05:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
so perhaps but I will say that child
 
05:56:12.788 --> 05:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
care providers individual child care
 
05:56:15.948 --> 05:56:15.958 align:start position:0%
providers do not have a very strong
 
05:56:20.390 --> 05:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
voice in New Hampshire so and a lot of
 
05:56:23.868 --> 05:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
things get done to us without our
 
05:56:27.270 --> 05:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
consult consultation right so um I would
 
05:56:29.270 --> 05:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
say our licensing regulations have
 
05:56:30.708 --> 05:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
always been incredibly cumbersome we
 
05:56:33.350 --> 05:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
were glad to tackle that some of the
 
05:56:36.868 --> 05:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
arpa funding that went through DHHS
 
05:56:39.590 --> 05:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
we frankly disagreed with um how those
 
05:56:43.910 --> 05:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
funds were being used um some of the
 
05:56:47.190 --> 05:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
ccdf plans the quality initiatives which
 
05:56:49.110 --> 05:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
is the QRS if anyone's everever heard of
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
that um we've frankly really disagree
 
05:56:56.230 --> 05:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
with that so um my concern would be if
 
05:56:59.150 --> 05:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
HHS developed their own Council it would
 
05:57:01.390 --> 05:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
be to promote
 
05:57:05.390 --> 05:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
HHS um agendas and I I know that sounds
 
05:57:07.590 --> 05:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
negative love them we work closely with
 
05:57:09.070 --> 05:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
them they're great Partners but truth of
 
05:57:11.548 --> 05:57:11.558 align:start position:0%
the matter is we argue with them a lot
 
05:57:13.430 --> 05:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
because we're about what it looks like
 
05:57:15.708 --> 05:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
not ideally not in a perfect world but
 
05:57:17.948 --> 05:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
what it looks like realistically to do
 
05:57:19.868 --> 05:57:19.878 align:start position:0%
this work in this per in this
 
05:57:23.590 --> 05:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
environment in our state and it's
 
05:57:26.468 --> 05:57:26.478 align:start position:0%
frustrating when State leadership does
 
05:57:29.110 --> 05:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
not hear the fact that sometimes a
 
05:57:30.948 --> 05:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
zoning law or sometimes something that's
 
05:57:33.350 --> 05:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
very well-intentioned can completely
 
05:57:35.548 --> 05:57:35.558 align:start position:0%
decimate a a business and that's why
 
05:57:37.468 --> 05:57:37.478 align:start position:0%
it's so important that they providers
 
05:57:41.150 --> 05:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
have a voice followup followup thank you
 
05:57:42.708 --> 05:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
very much and thank you for your
 
05:57:42.718 --> 05:57:45.110 align:start position:0%
very much and thank you for your
explanation

05:57:45.110 --> 05:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
05:57:47.948 --> 05:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
um I know you have one Senator and one
 
05:57:51.830 --> 05:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
State Rep on this council do you either
 
05:57:56.190 --> 05:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
call in other elected officials to meet
 
05:58:01.030 --> 05:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
with you and do you or if do you have
 
05:58:03.270 --> 05:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
individuals file legislation on the
 
05:58:05.628 --> 05:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
council's behalf we have not had them
 
05:58:07.350 --> 05:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
file leg legislation on the council's
 
05:58:10.110 --> 05:58:10.120 align:start position:0%
behalf we have recommended legislation
 
05:58:12.110 --> 05:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
that has had some
 
05:58:15.430 --> 05:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
legs I needed that clarification also so
 
05:58:17.670 --> 05:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
you do have legislators who are involved
 
05:58:19.430 --> 05:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
even though they're not members
 
05:58:22.590 --> 05:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
of and as far as um when we think of
 
05:58:25.070 --> 05:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
providers not being voting members our
 
05:58:27.868 --> 05:58:27.878 align:start position:0%
meetings um are in public but we also
 
05:58:29.510 --> 05:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
have a zoom option and we also have an
 
05:58:31.590 --> 05:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
evening option for people who can't be
 
05:58:33.830 --> 05:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
there but might still have questions um
 
05:58:36.788 --> 05:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
we have sometimes over 200 people child
 
05:58:39.670 --> 05:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
care providers going to our meetings and
 
05:58:40.910 --> 05:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
listening to the things that are
 
05:58:44.310 --> 05:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
happening there it is a very engaged
 
05:58:48.868 --> 05:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
Council so well so do I understand then
 
05:58:50.868 --> 05:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
that you do actively have involvement
 
05:58:53.230 --> 05:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
with legislators on a regular basis we
 
05:58:55.350 --> 05:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
do thank you we met with representative
 
05:58:59.788 --> 05:58:59.798 align:start position:0%

members non voting three non- voting and
 
05:59:51.708 --> 05:59:51.718 align:start position:0%

05:59:54.990 --> 05:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
um none none in the chair Child Care
 
05:59:57.390 --> 05:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
industry or something like maybe nope
 
05:59:59.708 --> 05:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:00:04.270 --> 06:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:06.548 --> 06:00:06.558 align:start position:0%
licensing okay so they
 
06:00:10.510 --> 06:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
they work for child care licensing I
 
06:00:10.520 --> 06:00:12.750 align:start position:0%
they work for child care licensing I
get

06:00:12.750 --> 06:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:00:14.510 --> 06:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
06:00:14.520 --> 06:00:17.110 align:start position:0%
right yeah
yes

06:00:17.110 --> 06:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:00:19.830 --> 06:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
um one of the other things that I saw in
 
06:00:22.548 --> 06:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
your in your bylaws that kind of struck
 
06:00:24.948 --> 06:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
me odd especially from the standpoint of
 
06:00:29.230 --> 06:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
a legislative um committee established
 
06:00:31.468 --> 06:00:31.478 align:start position:0%
was the fact that
 
06:00:34.948 --> 06:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
um uh you can basically add members on
 
06:00:40.310 --> 06:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
your own um you have the ability to um
 
06:00:44.910 --> 06:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
um add to your normally a legislative
 
06:00:47.468 --> 06:00:47.478 align:start position:0%
committee lays out who's going to be in
 
06:00:51.270 --> 06:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
it um this one says or anyone else that
 
06:00:55.230 --> 06:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
you choose um you can welcome them into
 
06:00:58.468 --> 06:00:58.478 align:start position:0%
the committee so I'm I'm certain you
 
06:01:01.110 --> 06:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
didn't always have 19 I think you've
 
06:01:04.910 --> 06:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
added people as you go um that's unusual
 
06:01:08.548 --> 06:01:08.558 align:start position:0%
for a for a legislative committee um so
 
06:01:11.190 --> 06:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
that that was just another audity and
 
06:01:13.590 --> 06:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
why I what triggered my question of how
 
06:01:17.190 --> 06:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
many members you have at this point um
 
06:01:18.910 --> 06:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
is do you have other testimony that you
 
06:01:22.990 --> 06:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
would like to add to no I don't think so
 
06:01:29.390 --> 06:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:32.750 --> 06:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions for now thank you um anything
 
06:01:36.030 --> 06:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
else I think we're all set thank you
 
06:01:37.990 --> 06:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
very much perfect thank
 
06:01:41.510 --> 06:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
you um with that I have no other pink
 
06:01:43.468 --> 06:01:43.478 align:start position:0%
cards I have does anyone else want to
 
06:01:46.430 --> 06:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
testify that's in the room no we're good
 
06:01:48.390 --> 06:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
um as far as I can see there's no one
 
06:01:50.990 --> 06:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
else and no one has contacted me from
 
06:01:53.708 --> 06:01:53.718 align:start position:0%
any of the other groups with the
 
06:01:57.708 --> 06:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
exception of the
 
06:02:00.548 --> 06:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
offshore now I can't find
 
06:02:04.510 --> 06:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
it yeah um offshore wind industry
 
06:02:06.628 --> 06:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
development re
 
06:02:09.270 --> 06:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
I believe that there's another piece of
 
06:02:11.510 --> 06:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that's either coming up this
 
06:02:14.708 --> 06:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
week or in the calendar that deals with
 
06:02:18.310 --> 06:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
that so that may that may be coming off
 
06:02:23.030 --> 06:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
um along the way but other than that um
 
06:02:25.990 --> 06:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
what what we will do as a committee is
 
06:02:31.230 --> 06:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
meet with um Deborah Charles and before
 
06:02:33.788 --> 06:02:33.798 align:start position:0%
we exec any of these things uh and we'll
 
06:02:37.868 --> 06:02:37.878 align:start position:0%
find out what the information is um as I
 
06:02:39.830 --> 06:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
get any more information I'll certainly
 
06:02:43.468 --> 06:02:43.478 align:start position:0%
provide it to the committee yep child I
 
06:02:45.628 --> 06:02:45.638 align:start position:0%

06:03:27.548 --> 06:03:27.558 align:start position:0%
lively um um executive session I have
 
06:03:29.750 --> 06:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
just one of the reason I jumped out of
 
06:03:31.948 --> 06:03:31.958 align:start position:0%
here was to create the exec session
 
06:03:35.310 --> 06:03:35.320 align:start position:0%
before the calendar deadline so um we've
 
06:03:38.310 --> 06:03:38.320 align:start position:0%

06:04:10.830 --> 06:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
period of time and take a take a u lunch
 
06:04:12.948 --> 06:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
break if we want to we can do but
 
06:04:15.350 --> 06:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
they're not set times all the way
 
06:04:17.070 --> 06:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
through what's our deadline for getting
 
06:04:19.910 --> 06:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
reports out um now that we've
 
06:04:23.310 --> 06:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
accomplished our our early bill um our
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
our next deadlines uh are all
 
06:04:30.948 --> 06:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
320 okay so we are we're close we're
 
06:04:34.510 --> 06:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
close and and we still have the concern
 
06:04:37.150 --> 06:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
that uh the 12 turns into
 
06:04:40.390 --> 06:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
a um a session day and if that's the
 
06:04:44.510 --> 06:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
case uh be be mindful of me going to the
 
06:04:47.868 --> 06:04:47.878 align:start position:0%
well um at one of
 
06:04:52.788 --> 06:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
the um house sessions so that we can um
 
06:04:54.788 --> 06:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
that will count as a
 
06:04:57.390 --> 06:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
calendar um notification of when we're
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
moving things to so um I don't think we
 
06:05:02.350 --> 06:05:02.360 align:start position:0%
would have time to get it in the
 
06:05:04.830 --> 06:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
calendar if they come back and say on
 
06:05:08.990 --> 06:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
the 12th we're having a session day um
 
06:05:25.230 --> 06:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:27.270 --> 06:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
quickly yeah
 
06:05:30.190 --> 06:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
so so instead of putting it in the
 
06:05:33.350 --> 06:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
calendar you can satisfy the public
 
06:05:36.270 --> 06:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
notice public notice by
 
06:05:40.390 --> 06:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
um by publicly stating it at the well
 
06:05:43.830 --> 06:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
when when we will meet so but I will
 
06:05:45.708 --> 06:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
with a small committee I will make sure
 
06:05:51.868 --> 06:05:51.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah it won't be that
 
06:05:55.120 --> 06:05:56.708 align:start position:0%
so yeah it won't be that
day

06:05:56.708 --> 06:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
day
 
06:06:00.390 --> 06:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
um what I'm hearing is if we're meeting
 
06:06:02.670 --> 06:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
if we have that many bills that stack up
 
06:06:04.670 --> 06:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
and have to be handled we will be
 
06:06:11.590 --> 06:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:14.510 --> 06:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
days if if we get to that point I mean
 
06:06:16.628 --> 06:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
it it may even be
 
06:06:20.110 --> 06:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
the H yeah it may even be the following
 
06:06:22.670 --> 06:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
week which is the deadline right because
 
06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
the 12th so it would be the 19th and
 
06:06:28.948 --> 06:06:28.958 align:start position:0%
20th it may be that week so I'm hope
 
06:06:31.070 --> 06:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
actually sounds terrible but I am
 
06:06:33.948 --> 06:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
hopeful it's that rather than screwing
 
06:06:36.990 --> 06:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
up our schedule for getting out on the
 
06:06:40.110 --> 06:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
but we will need um we will need reports
 
06:06:43.270 --> 06:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
quickly for that as well so the good
 
06:06:47.110 --> 06:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
part about a lot of our bills we have
 
06:06:51.948 --> 06:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
reports already written um so um from
 
06:06:54.030 --> 06:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
prior years that we've done this so you
 
06:06:56.190 --> 06:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
pretty much can just pull I think at
 
06:06:58.310 --> 06:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
least five of these I think we've
 
06:07:01.310 --> 06:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
already heard so so assuming the results
 
06:07:03.990 --> 06:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
are the same uh anything else anybody
 
06:07:09.910 --> 06:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:13.670 --> 06:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
104 adios thanks for everybody for today
