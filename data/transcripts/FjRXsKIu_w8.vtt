00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody it's Friday
 
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.589 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody it's Friday
[Music]

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's good news yeah that's the good
 
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
news that's the good news
 
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
the other news though is that you need
 
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
to look at the calendar for coming up
 
00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 align:start position:0%
next week and in that calendar there's a
 
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
number of our bills that are listed in
 
00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
that calendar for everybody sitting here
 
00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 align:start position:0%
at the tables
 
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
um there are at least I would say close
 
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
to 10 10 bills on consent
 
00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
and then we have a host of bills that
 
00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 align:start position:0%
are coming on on the regular calendar so
 
00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 align:start position:0%
if you haven't looked it over look it
 
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
over be be aware that that is coming up
 
00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's it's going to be a
 
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
lengthy it seems like a lengthy day but
 
00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 align:start position:0%
there's uh it's a day also when there's
 
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
a lot of other stuff going on with it
 
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 align:start position:0%
with it with the governor as well
 
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.610 align:start position:0%
with it with the governor as well
so

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
um I think in both of the caucuses which
 
00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 align:start position:0%
we'll have you will be discussing that
 
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh going on into the first item on our
 
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
docket for today
 
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
on Executive session we have an
 
00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
executive session for 577. this is
 
00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 align:start position:0%
relative to state aid for special
 
00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 align:start position:0%
education pupils uh representative call
 
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
upon you for a motion yeah I would do a
 
00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 align:start position:0%
move to retain this bill and I'll second
 
00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.510 align:start position:0%
move to retain this bill and I'll second
that

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
you have it you're you're are you ready
 
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 align:start position:0%
to go over there
 
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
if it's right out of the shoot I know
 
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
it's pardon me no one wants to okay
 
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
um so once again the motion is to retain
 
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
for 577 the Motions made by represent
 
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
Myler and second by representative Ladd
 
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh the the issue is relative to state
 
00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
aid for special education pupils
 
00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 align:start position:0%
represent Milo you're recognized uh
 
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I mean this this as
 
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
we in the testimony we we discover that
 
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 align:start position:0%
this is a very important bill
 
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
and but it has uh multiple kinds of
 
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
issues related to it
 
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh to Move It from three and a half
 
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
times one and a half times there
 
00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
obviously is a cost benefit on this and
 
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
also how it would be applied uh to
 
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
special uh special education services so
 
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
my sense is that we we just need to have
 
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
a little more time to look at this
 
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
because it has a major ramification for
 
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh special education students and
 
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
parents thank you Mr chair thank you and
 
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
I will offer a little bit of discussion
 
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
on it as well by reducing from three and
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
a half times to one and a half times or
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
two and a half wherever we may go we've
 
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
had this bill come before us before but
 
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
then when you have this type of Bill
 
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
come in you're also discussing the
 
00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 align:start position:0%
eighty percent twenty percent which is
 
00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
The Next Step Beyond and you have to
 
00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
take into account the students which are
 
00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 align:start position:0%
now going to be qualifying for that and
 
00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
a number of new students which are going
 
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
to be coming in and qualifying for the
 
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
the at the special education Aid and
 
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
there is a a Glide path there we just
 
00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
don't have the information on numbers of
 
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
students or even potential numbers of
 
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.210 align:start position:0%
students or even potential numbers of
students

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
um and how that would impact the
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
delivery of services the whole nine
 
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
yards so there's a lot to this
 
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
um we have it's also uh very much a part
 
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
of this discussion we're having on how
 
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
we're funding education
 
00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 align:start position:0%
and this is a huge portion of one aspect
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
of special education that needs to be
 
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
looked at seriously and I think we all
 
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
agree upon that I brought the bill
 
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 align:start position:0%
forward last time trying to reduce it
 
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
down too and we hit that same wall but
 
00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 align:start position:0%
however now we need to really dig in and
 
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
resolve how we're going to fund this
 
00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
aspect of special needs further
 
00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.149 align:start position:0%
aspect of special needs further
discussion

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just need a little
 
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
more understanding as a freshman rep
 
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 align:start position:0%
so when it's retained is a study
 
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
committee formed or how does the work
 
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
happen and what is the timeline likely
 
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
to be when we retain a bill we retain a
 
00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
bill and next time we take that bill up
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
we'll be in November and and so in
 
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
November the Motions can be ought to
 
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
pass I itl or interim study in the
 
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
interim what we do is we put a and and
 
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
this is one of those bills which we
 
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
won't have just a work session it will
 
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
be a subcommittee whether it's a
 
00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that's developed
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
with so many people on it or whether
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's a subcommittee of the whole if it's
 
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the whole it means we have a
 
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee here with all folks on this
 
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
particular body right here participating
 
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
in that study by doing so we also invite
 
00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 align:start position:0%
technical support in to offer us
 
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
assistance and that is exactly what we
 
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes
 
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you just to follow up so that
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
study committee whether it's partial or
 
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.189 align:start position:0%
study committee whether it's partial or
whole

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
would be meeting in the summer
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
we start meeting on that as soon as we
 
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
unload our bills and we have oftentimes
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
started in the late spring side uh when
 
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
we get rid of the Senate bills we are
 
00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
restricted at times as far as how when
 
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
we can start the subcommittee in the
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
past when we've had a bill like this
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
I've always been able to you know convey
 
00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 align:start position:0%
to leadership that this is a bill which
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
we're wasting time we need to get on to
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
right now and we have done that uh we
 
00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 align:start position:0%
don't do it with many but uh the area of
 
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
this where it's a policy implication and
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
a finance implication
 
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
it's oftentimes we will bring in people
 
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
from Finance as well into this
 
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
discussion as we did with the Medicaid
 
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.390 align:start position:0%
discussion as we did with the Medicaid
direct

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
direct
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
last year we had a subcommittee with uh
 
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
chaired by Karen umberger at the time so
 
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
yes we would get going probably
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the latter part or when we
 
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
get into the spring months and we have
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
less going on here and I say less but
 
00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean we don't have a lot
 
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
so that's what we try to do and we don't
 
00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
meet during the summer months
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
um unless you're on a statutory
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
commission and the statutory commission
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
will continue working right through as
 
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
you will know with you know the the CTE
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
stuff and all that we keep going public
 
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure we keep going on
 
00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 align:start position:0%
that however this type of study we pick
 
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
it up later on in the fall and that
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
gives us you know when you're talking
 
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 align:start position:0%
about September October then November it
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
gives a significant amount of time there
 
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
we'll pick that up at 9 45 with 6 6 51 I
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
would just remind everybody the bills
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
which are on consent
 
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:32.459 align:start position:0%
that the person who made the committee
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
report needs to be ready if somebody
 
00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
pulls a bill we've got to respond to
 
00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:39.419 align:start position:0%
that and we'll let you know as soon as
 
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
we know that anything's been pulled uh
 
00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
but be prepared for that let's break for
 
00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:45.050 align:start position:0%
but be prepared for that let's break for
caucus

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
um do you have a room you're going to go
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
to represent mileage you're going to
 
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
find one just wander the halls there
 
00:08:59.650 --> 00:08:59.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
we are a little smaller sub or
 
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:13.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:16.740 align:start position:0%
that's right we should that both of the
 
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
bills which the speaker will basically
 
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
just call for a Voice vote and move on
 
00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:25.019 align:start position:0%
uh that's where it's at 20 to 0 or 17 to
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
3 or something like that so we don't
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
have to sign up to speak again they'll
 
00:09:32.769 --> 00:09:32.779 align:start position:0%
just move right to the wakeboard yeah
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
that that's that's a good question
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
so you know when you have something like
 
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
it's a 17 or 3 or a 1901 or a 20-0 we
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully will move on on that without
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
having the great Kaka
 
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.550 align:start position:0%
having the great Kaka
yeah

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
that's right okay
 
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.190 align:start position:0%
that's right okay
and

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I heard that was um good like yeah
 
00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
so we'll yeah I'm going to talk about
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
this yeah good so we are moving into we
 
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
are are moving into caucus here in the
 
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:10.019 align:start position:0%
room right now so we'll have to have the
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%

representing Tuftonboro Wolfeboro and
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
Ossipee in the beautiful Lakes Region
 
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure we're all familiar with Uber
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
and Lyft and the other Rideshare
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
companies uh at this point uh but there
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
is a movement growing Across the Nation
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
to provide a similar uh facilities and
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
um it's they're not meant to be
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
replacements for those big big yellow
 
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
buses or even the medium-sized yellow
 
00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:35.750 align:start position:0%
buses or even the medium-sized yellow
buses

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
buses
 
00:51:38.569 --> 00:51:38.579 align:start position:0%
um these are knit Niche Transportation
 
00:51:41.329 --> 00:51:41.339 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and we'll get into some of
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
that some of those
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of companies that
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
are doing this nationally I've talked to
 
00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.430 align:start position:0%
are doing this nationally I've talked to
several

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
several
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
um the information that's going around
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
is in relation to one of those companies
 
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
called hop skip and drive they're in
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
over 12 States at this point and they
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
are interested in coming to New
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I talked to another company
 
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:12.059 align:start position:0%
that is not interested but um I think
 
00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:14.839 align:start position:0%
this is something more that we'll see
 
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
around the country
 
00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:18.950 align:start position:0%
around the country
and

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
in particular I think that
 
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
um this type of service fits in very
 
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
well with some of the problem areas for
 
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
transportation we have talked about in
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.329 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
um

00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
homeless children
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
trying to arrange bus transportation for
 
00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:45.260 align:start position:0%
them where they are
 
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
foster care children you could have a
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
foster care child placed in a home at
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
seven o'clock at night
 
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
for that school then to try and arrange
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
transportation for them it might take a
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
week or so with a service like this
 
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
they'll have transportation the next day
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
to get to school
 
00:53:04.859 --> 00:53:05.530 align:start position:0%
to get to school
um

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:05.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:10.460 align:start position:0%
the CTE Alternatives we've talked about
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
trying to get a small number of in many
 
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
cases of students from ascending
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
school to a CTE Center and the cost of
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
transportation for those CTE Services
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
these services are primarily for
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are eight passengers or
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
less so they can handle
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
provide a lower cost alternative to what
 
00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:41.180 align:start position:0%
many districts are having to do now
 
00:53:45.049 --> 00:53:45.059 align:start position:0%
the other one that came to my mind was a
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
special ed services
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
when this IEP related Transportation
 
00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
needed but in particular we've talked
 
00:53:52.859 --> 00:53:53.530 align:start position:0%
needed but in particular we've talked
about

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:53.540 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
charter schools and special needs and
 
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with issues for several
 
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:00.790 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with issues for several
terms

00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
terms
 
00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:05.099 align:start position:0%
related to where if the student is in a
 
00:54:08.809 --> 00:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
charter school has an IEP the resident
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
school district is responsible for their
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
services the service question is where
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
are those Services provided do they send
 
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
the child back back on a big yellow bus
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
back to the sending District the sending
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
District send someone to the Charter
 
00:54:24.119 --> 00:54:25.490 align:start position:0%
District send someone to the Charter
School

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
School
 
00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
um these Alternatives I think are a
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
perfect fit for those scenarios
 
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
and one of the nice things about these
 
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
services and this one in particular that
 
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
I know of
 
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
they have an app on your phone so you
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
can go in as a parent and schedule
 
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
recurring rides or a one-time ride if
 
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
you're transporting your child most days
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
but you need a ride tomorrow because
 
00:54:53.329 --> 00:54:53.339 align:start position:0%
you're not going to work or something
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
you can go into the app and schedule a
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
ride for your child the next day
 
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:02.150 align:start position:0%
ride for your child the next day
um

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
Hallmarks of this company I think is
 
00:55:07.859 --> 00:55:09.589 align:start position:0%
Hallmarks of this company I think is
um

00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
one their safety but also
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
um they call their drivers care drivers
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
they take very seriously
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
um the service that they're providing
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
fact that they are transporting school
 
00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:28.670 align:start position:0%
fact that they are transporting school
children

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:29.990 align:start position:0%
children
um

00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
I don't have copies for everybody but
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to provide a copy of their
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh 2021 or 22 safety reports they're
 
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
like this thick going over their safety
 
00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.510 align:start position:0%
like this thick going over their safety
record

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
they go through an extensive extensive
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
series of
 
00:55:55.569 --> 00:55:55.579 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
00:55:55.579 --> 00:55:57.370 align:start position:0%
background checks
investigations

00:55:57.370 --> 00:55:57.380 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
checking the vehicles and so forth
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
I have also talked to the uh Department
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles and I I think uh I
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
think someone is here in fact I know
 
00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
someone is here from them today and I
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
think uh he'll talk about uh how they
 
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
what is going on now is we know what DMV
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
requires of vehicles to transport school
 
00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:36.980 align:start position:0%
students and
 
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
DMV will be talking to people from hop
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
skip and drive to work out arrangements
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
and the processes for those requirements
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
for instance that's very possible that
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
some of the equipment
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
required for the transport Vehicles
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
could be waived and we've talked about
 
00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:01.220 align:start position:0%
that with a DMV
 
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
but we're uh we all want to make sure
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
that the background checks and
 
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
everything else are done and that's part
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
of what hop skip and drive does and
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
they're anxious to work out all the
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
arrangements with our DMV people
 
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
but I think that this has a great
 
00:57:26.329 --> 00:57:26.339 align:start position:0%
potential for solving some of our
 
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
transportation problems here in New
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
um uh it's it's seems to be coming from
 
00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
the west coast to the east coast as as
 
00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
many things do
 
00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
um but I think we can uh be a leader on
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
the east coast in terms of
 
00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
rectifying some of the transportation
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
problems and costs that we have for
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
these Niche areas here in New Hampshire
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh are there questions from the
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative Miler uh
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative cordello for bringing
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
this before us uh two related questions
 
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh we in this committee have always been
 
00:58:13.609 --> 00:58:13.619 align:start position:0%
concerned about uh safety of children
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
not just from a vehicle standpoint but
 
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:18.020 align:start position:0%
from a driver's standpoint
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
how does this uh how does this bill
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
guarantee that there are appropriate
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
background checks etc for those drivers
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
that's the first question the second
 
00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
question is how do we know which
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
vehicles are appropriately equipped to
 
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
deal potentially with disabled children
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
who would have unique kinds of needs
 
00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
both from a wheelchair and from a
 
00:58:46.849 --> 00:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
mobility of getting in and out of
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
vehicles thank you for answering my
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
question sure thank you
 
00:58:51.599 --> 00:58:52.250 align:start position:0%
question sure thank you
um

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
I I think some of those questions will
 
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
be answered by the uh by the trooper who
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
is here today
 
00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh this is just a checklist of some of
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
the things that
 
00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
um hop skip tribe does in other states
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
um and they've as I said they've worked
 
00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
with at least 12 different states and
 
00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
are very accustomed to working with
 
00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:16.140 align:start position:0%
local officials to make sure that they
 
00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:17.150 align:start position:0%
local officials to make sure that they
are

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
um in compliance with uh local
 
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
requirements and so I I do not see that
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
as a major issue going forward
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
but things that they require for
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
instance at least five years of
 
00:59:32.049 --> 00:59:32.059 align:start position:0%
caregiving experience being finger
 
00:59:32.059 --> 00:59:33.670 align:start position:0%
caregiving experience being finger
printed

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
printed
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
scanning for child abuse or neglect in
 
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
human services databases or local
 
00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:41.470 align:start position:0%
human services databases or local
databases

00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
databases
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
good driving records age requirements
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
proof of registration Insurance Etc as
 
00:59:49.609 --> 00:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
well as the fingerprinting and
 
00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
background checks so safety is um
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
Paramount in what they do and
 
00:59:59.569 --> 00:59:59.579 align:start position:0%
um it's something that I've talked
 
01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:03.299 align:start position:0%
extensively with them about unfound
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
follow up yes and the uh the vehicle
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
issue how how is that dealt with
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
um uh I uh
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
I I think that um that is arranged with
 
01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.170 align:start position:0%
I I think that um that is arranged with
the

01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
um uh the matching of the driver and the
 
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
vehicle with the person who is
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
requesting the uh Transportation so that
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
would be worked out
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
um uh between
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
um the company and the person as to what
 
01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
type of facilities for transportation
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
are required thank you further questions
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
the question is uh and thank you for
 
01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:44.339 align:start position:0%
taking it is how is this going to be
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
paid is it is it uh the person that
 
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
requests the the vehicle or is it the
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
school district or who actually ends up
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
paying the money for this
 
01:00:57.289 --> 01:00:57.299 align:start position:0%
um depending on um the type of service
 
01:00:57.299 --> 01:00:59.089 align:start position:0%
um depending on um the type of service
and

01:00:59.089 --> 01:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
um who's requesting that it could be um
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh all of the above uh so it could be a
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
parent requesting uh Transportation
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
under special circumstances
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
um it could be the district
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
um especially in some of the instances
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
we talked about in terms of having to
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
provide transportation to a CTE Center
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
or Transportation related to special ed
 
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
services for a student at a charter
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
school I would see those as being a
 
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
understanding because I worked in a
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
district that almost everybody got bust
 
01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:45.380 align:start position:0%
well everybody did get bust to school
 
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
that there is there is an issue with
 
01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:51.980 align:start position:0%
Contracting with the busing service
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
and then having smaller vendors do uh
 
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
you know at will uh runs for them that
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
that the school generally contracts in
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
bulk and then the Contracting Services
 
01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:08.809 align:start position:0%
bulk and then the Contracting Services
provides

01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
provides
 
01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
the appropriate boss whether it's a
 
01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
wheelchair you know
 
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
um accessible or whatever
 
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
um that's part of their contract
 
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
how do you think how do you see school
 
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
districts being able to
 
01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.270 align:start position:0%
districts being able to
um

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
deal with with those kinds of issues
 
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
I think would be on a um District by
 
01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
District basis based on the terms of any
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
contract they currently have for
 
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
transportation services the length of
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
the contract
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
um vehicle situations
 
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think there's uh one size
 
01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
fits all answers that question but I
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
think it's a district by District issue
 
01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:51.140 align:start position:0%
to be looked at
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
um representative Vlad and thank you for
 
01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:00.059 align:start position:0%
presenting the bill and uh for taking my
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
question representative has uh nhsta
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this bill or one of the
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
Troopers here representing that agency
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes uh I uh had a meeting with the
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner and troopers at DMV uh a
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago so they are here to
 
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
uh talk about it as well thank you
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
yes represent McDonald thank you
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for bringing this
 
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.450 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for bringing this
forward

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:03:29.089 --> 01:03:29.099 align:start position:0%
this bill is not specific to HUB skip
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
drive and that company is not mentioned
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
within the bill correct is there a
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
potential for another company to
 
01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:36.059 align:start position:0%
contract or are there to be a
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
competition between them without
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
question right that's why it was
 
01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't put a specific company in
 
01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
in to legislation
 
01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
um but there are several companies who
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
are doing this
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
um it's just that uh
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
um the one company I talked to was not
 
01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:54.299 align:start position:0%
interested in New Hampshire and and hop
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
skip and drive was very interested and
 
01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
they are doing it already in multiple
 
01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:00.059 align:start position:0%
States thank you
 
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good morning good
 
01:04:06.299 --> 01:04:07.849 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good morning good
morning

01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
um on the particular Bill uh do you
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
envision I'm thinking of my school
 
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
district when I see the lodge all of us
 
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
ago go out and come back with three kids
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
go out and come back with three kids
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
um but they have to make their run to
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
Jackson about all the places do you do
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
you envision saying this at some point
 
01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
in the future replacing the lodge school
 
01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
buses in rural areas
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
um I I I I doubt it
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
um but uh I'm not sure again I think
 
01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
would be a district by District base
 
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
basis as to what their runs look like
 
01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
and the number of uh children in those
 
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.490 align:start position:0%
and the number of uh children in those
runs

01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
runs
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
um but um in your area I know
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
um of uh for instance uh Hale's location
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
which is now faced with the question of
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh transporting uh to elementary
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
school students
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
um and um I think this would be a
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
perfect solution for them
 
01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
um so I I you know I don't know if
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
there's um one boilerplate answer to
 
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.430 align:start position:0%
there's um one boilerplate answer to
that

01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
um not a fall of a different one uh
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative do the vehicles that
 
01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
these uh smaller programs use are they
 
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
all the the uh standardized vehicle like
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
a bus or I guess I'm trying to decide if
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
I if I stop my own company can I just
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
use my car if it meets the DMV
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
regulations or are they all different
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
are they all different pieces of
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
different types of vehicles
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
um yes as long as it uh passes uh muster
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
with a DMV for transporting children
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
um it could be your van of some sort
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
anything okay yeah all right most likely
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
apparently written on my car thank you I
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
pass it every morning coming down the
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
interstate thank you represent Belcher
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for daily
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
um given them would this bill um help
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
not just public school students but
 
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
would also be available to things like
 
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:10.930 align:start position:0%
would also be available to things like
um

01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:10.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
homeschooling centers and private
 
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
schooling or is is not is none of that
 
01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:18.299 align:start position:0%
involved in this yet
 
01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:20.579 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
01:06:23.809 --> 01:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
um yes this company does provide those
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
types of services elsewhere
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
um as well for instance a uh homeschool
 
01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.010 align:start position:0%
um as well for instance a uh homeschool
student

01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
um wanting to go to a Cooperative
 
01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:36.980 align:start position:0%
program or something like that
 
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
I believe they're also involved in a
 
01:06:44.089 --> 01:06:44.099 align:start position:0%
Pre-K programs in transportation in some
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
states as well
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you just so given so
 
01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
given our move toward greater
 
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom allowing parents to
 
01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:54.059 align:start position:0%
send their students where they want them
 
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
to go would get the kind of education
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
they want them to receive does this you
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
do you see this as facilitating solving
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
logistical errors possibly before they
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
um I uh I would also always like to
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
solve problems before they occur
 
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
um but uh yeah I think that this has uh
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
great potential in a number of areas
 
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned and probably others
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
that we haven't even thought of yet
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Russell Woodcock you have
 
01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
another question thank you there's one
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
final one
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I know we how I am but in the bigger
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
District we'll further over this thing
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh in our uh contract with the the
 
01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:37.140 align:start position:0%
company that does our our transportation
 
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
there is an uh an allowance for small
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
vendors to do some specialized now to go
 
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
out and pick up those kids would that be
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
any different from this
 
01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
the school district now had the right to
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
do that through the contract
 
01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yeah I I think as long as
 
01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
um that company is is meeting
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
um state requirements
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
um uh I yeah I think that that is an
 
01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.510 align:start position:0%
um uh I yeah I think that that is an
option

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you we do have the uh officers
 
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
here uh any more questions for

oh okay thank you

01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:32.660 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
good morning okay my name is uh Trooper
 
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
first class Gregory Hildreth Alaska
 
01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:40.510 align:start position:0%
first class Gregory Hildreth Alaska
spelled

01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
spelled
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
h-i-l-d-r-e-t-h for the record I am
 
01:08:45.169 --> 01:08:45.179 align:start position:0%
currently the supervisor for Pupil
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation at the State Police uh
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
working in conjunction with the
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
right now as written the state is
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill uh the intent
 
01:08:56.759 --> 01:08:58.070 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill uh the intent
however

01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to go over it
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
can already be accomplished and
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
I'll go through it from the start so the
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
first question the state had when
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
reading this bill is you know is there a
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
need for this specific legislation is it
 
01:09:15.169 --> 01:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish something that
 
01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
can't already be done there are two rsas
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
primarily uh 259 96 and 259.96 a those
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
are what give the department of safety
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
the authority and the oversight of the
 
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
current School Bus industry under 259.96
 
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
the breakdown on the synopsis of what
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
that law states is a school bus is any
 
01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle that is being utilized
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
transporting students to and from home
 
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
and to school related activities or
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
School related activities in Louisville
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
contract the municipality or School
 
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
District so if a vehicle is transporting
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
a child from home to school and it's
 
01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
being compensated in any way by the
 
01:09:55.729 --> 01:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
school district or furthering the school
 
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
district's needs that isn't being
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
accomplished outside it's considered a
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
school bus in that time in operation
 
01:10:05.209 --> 01:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
if it falls under 259.96 it falls under
 
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules the safc 1300
 
01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
rules which regulate school buses that
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
regulates drivers background check
 
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
requirements it regulates their training
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
requirements it regulates the equipment
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
on board there's two different
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
breakdowns in sections uh just to take a
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
step back
 
01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
most people when you say School Bus the
 
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
first image that comes to your head is
 
01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:27.860 align:start position:0%
going to be a yellow bus out on the road
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
that is a fallacy because it's not
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
completely correct uh that is some of
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
them we classify them as Class A B C and
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
D buses those are how they're recognized
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
the yellow buses there typically from
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
the short bus all the way up to the
 
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
large flat nose bus however there's a
 
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
class 5 which is considered which is the
 
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
not the name of it but that's another
 
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
class of vehicle it's called an MPV a
 
01:10:51.169 --> 01:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
multi-passenger vehicle and to answer
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
your question that's those Dodge
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
Caravans Crown
 
01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
Victoria's whatever else is out there
 
01:10:59.209 --> 01:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fit that by legislative
 
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
under the legislation they are limited
 
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
to carrying a maximum passenger capacity
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
of 10 to include the driver beyond that
 
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
we want them a kids in safer Vehicles
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
the bigger buses that are designed like
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
tanks on Wheels they have steel
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
reinforcement those black bars you see
 
01:11:16.729 --> 01:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
running around the perimeter that hip
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
shoulder and foot level you know there's
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
all kinds of safety features that are
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
regulated under the administrative rules
 
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
in the 1308 section
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
1312 deals with all those other vehicles
 
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
the Crown Victoria's the Dodge Caravans
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
all that so there's equipment
 
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
requirements that are still required of
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
those via Vehicles so those are all
 
01:11:37.729 --> 01:11:37.739 align:start position:0%
school buses when they're operating as I
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
explained before and this goes back to
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
my initial statement of what's the
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
intent what are we trying to accomplish
 
01:11:46.729 --> 01:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
with this law because right now
 
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
if they're willing to follow those rules
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
that are currently in place and start up
 
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
their own company under the name of hop
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
skip and a drive they can absolutely do
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
that right now today and become a school
 
01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
bus company falling under our 259 96
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
rules transporting to and from school
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
and home related activities in
 
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
Louisville contract municipality if
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing all that that's great so
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
where was this law coming from uh
 
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
if the intent was to circumvent those
 
01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
rules and to essentially allow them to
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
operate just on this law alone and give
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
them the green light to now become a
 
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
school bus company go do transport
 
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
because it's written into the 376 laws
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
this is where the state objects because
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
at this point if the intent is to okay
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to follow the existing
 
01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
laws and those safety measures in place
 
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
we need to have a cross-reference in the
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
current writing of the law that
 
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
references 259.96. if they're trying to
 
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
and in the back of this law it makes
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
reference to putting it into the same
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
category as 259.96 a a mixed use bus
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
this in a way hints at maybe taking it
 
01:12:54.729 --> 01:12:54.739 align:start position:0%
outside of our oversight because under
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
259.96a I've already explained the
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
qualifiers of a school bus a mixed use
 
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
bus under 96a has three qualifiers on
 
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
its own if it is operated or owned or at
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
least by the school
 
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
it has to be driven for by any School
 
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
employee so someone has undergone the
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
fingerprint check at least once and if
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's in time it's being used utilized
 
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
for school activities that vehicle does
 
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
not follow the 1300 rules it does not
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
fall under oversight so it takes itself
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
outside of the rules and this is where
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
the concern is we're 259.96a is
 
01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the latter half of this
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
bill where it says it could be a mixed
 
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
use bus a transportation Network company
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
could never ever be a mixed-use bus It
 
01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
could only be because it misses the
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
first qualifier it wasn't owned released
 
01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
by the school once you cross that one
 
01:13:42.179 --> 01:13:42.910 align:start position:0%
by the school once you cross that one
off

01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
259.96a no longer applies it cannot be
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
put into place that was only allowed to
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
be in place for a school willing to go
 
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
out and buy their own vehicle to do
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
those local transports for school
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
related activities and field trips and
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
the caveat of not having the driver have
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
to have a school bus certificate which
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
is regulated by 259.96 was that at least
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
hey at least they need to have been
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
fingerprint checked by the Department of
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
Education once and that was where
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
259.968 came in from so
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
again if we go back to what's the intent
 
01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:16.140 align:start position:0%
of this if they're willing to follow the
 
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
process is there a need for this law uh
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
if they're not the concerns of the state
 
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
are if we're going to circumvent the
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
current oversight and regulation of
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
Pupil Transportation uh this would
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
basically allow all the safety checks
 
01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
and walls and the criteria that has been
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
approved as far as what's acceptable in
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
a driver to be thrown out the window and
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to assume that a third party
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
fingerprint check is going to meet all
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
the criteria uh if it's approved this
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
bill would allow drivers that are
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
operating these vehicles no longer the
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
need to be rostered uh tracked with a
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
state as far as their training goes to
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that these drivers are
 
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
qualified and don't have any
 
01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
disqualifying material in their
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
background and they don't have to
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
undergo annual training they don't have
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
anything that basically requires us or
 
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
gives us the authority to make sure that
 
01:15:04.490 --> 01:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
they're complying with the existing laws
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
like we currently have and the ability
 
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
to go audit existing school bus
 
01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:08.630 align:start position:0%
to go audit existing school bus
companies

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh equipment on these vehicles as I
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the 1312 section we dictate
 
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
that they have to have certain equipment
 
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
body fluid spill kits medical kits they
 
01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
got to have a seat belt cutter they got
 
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
to have certain stop a sign on top of
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
the roof that gives us a four-way
 
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
warning system they have to have
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
markings now there is the ability for
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
certain companies under circumstance
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances to request waivers
 
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
so they don't have to go through the
 
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
expense of adding some of this stuff a
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle that's going to pick up kids
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
exclusively in a driveway especially
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
under an IEP if the IEP allows it and
 
01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:42.980 align:start position:0%
then drive that kid to the
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
school but dropping them off outside of
 
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
what would be the normal loading and
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
unloading Zone where there's less
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
traffic if they're going to be doing
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
that there's no need for a roof sign
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
there's no need for markings on the side
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
this thing doesn't have to have that
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
equipment so the companies can actually
 
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
save money requesting a waiver from the
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner safety which we would issue
 
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
to the company but that vehicle would
 
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
still be required to go and do what's
 
01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
called a school bus inspection so
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
everybody's familiar in New Hampshire
 
01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
with the bottom left your windshield you
 
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
of your state safety inspection that's
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
compliant with the safc 3200 rules the
 
01:16:14.689 --> 01:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
center sticker needs to comply with the
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
safc 1308 or 13-12 section which
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
dictates all that equipment that needs
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
to be on board if that inspector is
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
making sure again annually we got to
 
01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:24.380 align:start position:0%
make sure this is being done
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
that this equipment is on board so we
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
have some oversight to make sure this
 
01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
stuff is being accomplished if this is
 
01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
passed as is with no reference to 259.96
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that they're put into that
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
same category we run the risk of having
 
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
that oversight gone
 
01:16:43.370 --> 01:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
the follow-up issue is again drivers who
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
might have failed a background check
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
with our department you know something
 
01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
that would have been hey this is a
 
01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
safety risk we can't have this driver
 
01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
this driver has too many driving
 
01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
violations that would have barred them
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that that would be
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
caught in a third party only background
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
check so a driver theoretically driving
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
and a company for First Student that
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
gets denied from our office could then
 
01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
just go and get a job at this
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
third-party company and potentially get
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
hired and do the exact same job in
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
transport with less oversight left
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
regulation which brings me to my final
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
point is if we're putting generally
 
01:17:16.729 --> 01:17:16.739 align:start position:0%
these vehicles are going to be smaller
 
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
they're going to be smaller in size
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's going to be less passengers
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
potentially it could be one person and
 
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
if we don't have thoroughly vetted
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
drivers and we put them alone with kids
 
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
you're just opening a potentially a
 
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
recipe for disaster
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
going back to the uh one of the members
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
questions I believe you mentioned uh if
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
a parent wanted to do this they can
 
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
already do that today if this is being
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
funded by a parent if a parent calls up
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
Uber tomorrow and says I want my child
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
brought there and they're the ones
 
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
funding it that's outside of the 1300
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
rules that's outside of 259.96 it they
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
can do that on their own accord a parent
 
01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
has a 100 absolute decision if they want
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
to pay for that themselves but if the
 
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
funding and decision is coming from the
 
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
school they must follow 259.96 and
 
01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
that's a state's position
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much officer Hilder are
 
01:18:09.169 --> 01:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
testimony I just it seems like most of
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
the the concern around it is based on
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
the the transferring of rule making
 
01:18:19.679 --> 01:18:20.930 align:start position:0%
the the transferring of rule making
Authority

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
um the possibility that there might be a
 
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
need to generate more rulemaking
 
01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.450 align:start position:0%
need to generate more rulemaking
Authority

01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
um but I guess I wanted to ask
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
that rule-making Authority was delegated
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
by this body in the first place correct
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not tracking what your uh the rule
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
making Authority for the executive
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
branch to create those rules based on
 
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
um the laws that you cited that
 
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
rule-making Authority originated in this
 
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
body and was delegated to the executive
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
branch so we could do that again if we
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
needed to with this correct that's why I
 
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
objective has written understood thank
 
01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:55.729 align:start position:0%
objective has written understood thank
you

01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you
 
01:18:59.209 --> 01:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
01:19:01.729 --> 01:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
we have a list of those objectives to
 
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
this objections to this that you have
 
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
that that we could have a copy of I
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
could absolutely do a cleaner version
 
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
I've been taking some pen notes on this
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to present this one but
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
I can certainly do that okay thank you
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
very much if I could just grab someone's
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
contact I will make sure I get it okay
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you just take one of those ticket
 
01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
forms you have and just scratch it on
 
01:19:20.699 --> 01:19:22.930 align:start position:0%
forms you have and just scratch it on
that

01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:22.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee I
 
01:19:27.649 --> 01:19:27.659 align:start position:0%
have one for you officer um yes sir uh
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
the inspection sticker which I have my
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
car on the front left windshield
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
um is issued by a local station that's
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
approved by the state uh the if I'm
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
working for Durham or Butler or first
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
student or some other Transportation
 
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
Company where do they get their buses or
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
Vehicles even the class five you speak
 
01:19:51.649 --> 01:19:51.659 align:start position:0%
of here which is much much smaller where
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
are those inspected through the same
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
person inspects my vehicle or do you
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
have a safety officer go out and inspect
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
these vehicles on a regular basis thank
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
you for your question uh that one is
 
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
easy they basically are not the same
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
person uh in order to give them a to
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
issue that left sticker on the bottom
 
01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
left for your safety inspection sticker
 
01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
they need to go and actually be examined
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
and prove that they can pass a test and
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
they know what the laws are looking for
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
they aren't trained at that level to
 
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
look for this the stuff that complies
 
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
with the 1300 section of the rules
 
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
they're only doing the 3200 third
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
section so in order to become and get
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
that middle window sticker which is your
 
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
school bus inspection sticker which is
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
the second sticker sticker required they
 
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
actually need to undergo a similar
 
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
training and evaluation so mechanics
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
willing to step up and do that are
 
01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
tested the same way where someone will
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
actually go out and test them make sure
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
they know what criteria they're looking
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
for once they do that they are then
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
certified as a school bus inspector and
 
01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:47.219 align:start position:0%
they can issue that sticker there are
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
Fleet stations that can do that so some
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
of those larger companies have their own
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
inspectors but smaller ones there are
 
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
plenty of school bus companies that are
 
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
more no more than one vehicle and
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
they'll have to go out and find a
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
mechanic and the Department of Motor
 
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
Vehicle can actually help those drivers
 
01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
locate them
 
01:21:05.209 --> 01:21:05.219 align:start position:0%
can I get one follow-up for you uh has
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
the department checked with other states
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
to see how this program may or may not
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
be functioning
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
we haven't the closest thing I can talk
 
01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
about is a transportation Network
 
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
company would be the equivalent of a
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
taxi cab company which we have several
 
01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
of in New Hampshire that do this
 
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
transport and the ones that we have are
 
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
com in compliance they're doing
 
01:21:24.169 --> 01:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
everything they're supposed to be doing
 
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of them have waivers so you might
 
01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
not even recognize it to be a school bus
 
01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
when you're passing it in which case
 
01:21:31.729 --> 01:21:31.739 align:start position:0%
they've been you know Exempted from
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
having the markings because the state
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
certainly recognizes the need for
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
transportation mckinney-vento was very
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
clear about that back in the 80s or 90s
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
that there must be a non-uh level there
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
can't be an undue level of hurdles
 
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
present preventing them but the need for
 
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
safety wasn't determined to be an unneed
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
hurdle it's kind of a mandatory
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
requirement so
 
01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to those taxi companies
 
01:21:56.689 --> 01:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
we certainly are willing to take them in
 
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
and open them up and help them get set
 
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
up and in fact I have a template for
 
01:22:01.729 --> 01:22:01.739 align:start position:0%
every company in fact representative
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
cordelli and I spoke and I forwarded him
 
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
that information this is what I provide
 
01:22:07.729 --> 01:22:07.739 align:start position:0%
to companies that want to start up a
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
school bus company from A to Z and this
 
01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
is how you do it legally and this is how
 
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
you you follow the existing laws to
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
establish your company and what you need
 
01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
to do as far as the department of safety
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
goes once they so but some of those
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
companies don't want to exclusively do
 
01:22:23.209 --> 01:22:23.219 align:start position:0%
school bus transportation you got those
 
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
taxi companies so they don't want to
 
01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
letter it up they don't want to put you
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
know the signs on top of the roofs or
 
01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
anything like that so that's where the
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner of safety's waiver comes in
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
they send us an email simply asking hey
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
we don't need this equipment we don't
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
need this because we have no need to
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
control traffic and we'd like a waiver
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
for that so we end up sending that over
 
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
if it's approved by the commissioner of
 
01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
safety it comes back they take that
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
waiver that's been approved go to that
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
safety or that school bus inspection
 
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
station and when the inspectors going
 
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
down that list looking for all this
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
equipment when they get to something
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
missing if it's on that waiver they just
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
bypass it the one thing we will never
 
01:22:59.330 --> 01:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
bypass especially with those smaller
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
Vehicles is when it comes to lettering
 
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
they all must still have at least a
 
01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
magnet or something visible to 50 feet
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
or greater saying that this vehicle
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
stops for all railroad crossings because
 
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
a school bus of any size needs to do
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
that and the last thing someone wants is
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
a Dodge Caravan that doesn't look like a
 
01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
school bus is to stop in the middle of
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
the road so that is a required uh
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
sticker but beyond that they might look
 
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
like Fast cab tax year they might just
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
you know you wouldn't know what the
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
school bus
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
I do have one other question we have a
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
number of Interstate school districts in
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
this in this in New Hampshire sir for
 
01:23:32.810 --> 01:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
example Rivendell
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and Butler bus does take kids onto
 
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
both sides of the river whether it's to
 
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
the five CTE centers all the way from
 
01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
Kanan up in Vermont down to Brattleboro
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
we have New Hampshire students attending
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
these centers
 
01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
is in approving something like this in
 
01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then that contracted
 
01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
service is transporting into Vermont
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
does Vermont have a separate set of
 
01:23:59.630 --> 01:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
statutes which we must comply with if
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
we're shipping students in that state
 
01:24:03.649 --> 01:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
which we do every day sure so any
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
company we're willing to work for a
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
school in New Hampshire is mandated to
 
01:24:09.649 --> 01:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
follow our rules under 259.96 so anybody
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
that's transporting for a New Hampshire
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
school regardless of what the end
 
01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
destination is most of all New Hampshire
 
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
schools if you have an out-of-state
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
school coming into New Hampshire to drop
 
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
off they and they're not doing anything
 
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
for a New Hampshire school they're
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
Exempted they can't we don't have any
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
oversight or ability to enforce our
 
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
rules upon them uh so I don't know if
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
that answers your question
 
01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
sort of we have a lot of our elementary
 
01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
kids are going to school in Fairly
 
01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:36.229 align:start position:0%
kids are going to school in Fairly
Vermont

01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
so that's a situation which I would you
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
know want to make sure that we're we're
 
01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
have them in safe Vehicles so if Vermont
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
is the school where the kids are going
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
and they just simply live in New
 
01:24:47.630 --> 01:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the bus from Vermont is
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
coming into New Hampshire or Butler bus
 
01:24:52.729 --> 01:24:52.739 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is being paid by that
 
01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
Vermont school to transport the New
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire student then no we have no New
 
01:24:58.729 --> 01:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oversight as far as that goes
 
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
because of that contracts with an
 
01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
out-of-state school they must have a
 
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
contract a municipality New Hampshire so
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
if it was vice versa with a Vermont
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
school is or school this company is
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
coming and picking up a student and then
 
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
bringing them to a New Hampshire school
 
01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
for a New Hampshire you know that's
 
01:25:16.729 --> 01:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
where the funding for that bus is coming
 
01:25:18.649 --> 01:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
from then yes even though they're out of
 
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
in the location of Vermont they are
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
required to comply with our rules in New
 
01:25:24.649 --> 01:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
01:25:29.570 --> 01:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
my question and thank you for your
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
thorough job trying to keep children
 
01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.550 align:start position:0%
thorough job trying to keep children
safe

01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
safe
 
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like if the bill
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
included a requirement for
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
compliance with the statutes you noted
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
the 259.96 and 259.96a
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
that it would meet the concerns that
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
you've cited but that it still would not
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
be a necessary Bill am I understanding
 
01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
that correctly I can't speak to a
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
fullness I don't deal with the 376 laws
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
frequently the transportation Network
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
company if it does something for some or
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
or agency or organization to have it
 
01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
listed as an option that they can do
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
this under 376. that's fine the concern
 
01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
came with because again 39 259 96a is it
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
can never apply to a taxi company you
 
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
can never comply to a uber company and
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's mentioned in that
 
01:26:25.129 --> 01:26:25.139 align:start position:0%
latter half of the bill almost makes
 
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
someone assume that they're putting it
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
into the same category and 259.96a is
 
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
completely outside the oversight of the
 
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
state even though that tiny little Dash
 
01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
a it makes all the difference because
 
01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:38.219 align:start position:0%
Dash a there they can do whatever they
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
want basically outside we can't do
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
anything about it 96 is what keeps them
 
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
in to our laws and oversight and rules
 
01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:46.139 align:start position:0%
and regulation to make sure that they're
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
complying with the safest possible
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
Transportation so it's more of if it
 
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
made a reference to you know it must
 
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
comply with 259.96 and then I'll throw
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
another one at you just because it's a
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
sub RSA but it's 263.29 which is the
 
01:27:01.729 --> 01:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
school bus certificate that's what the
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
drivers require to become a school bus
 
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
driver in New Hampshire so you have your
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
driver's license for the proper class
 
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
whatever size vehicle you're driving for
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
those smaller Vehicles just an operator
 
01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:13.739 align:start position:0%
license but you also have to have that
 
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
second document which is what's issued
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
from the DMV that's your school bus
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
certificate it doesn't matter if you
 
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
have a CDL license and it says School
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
Bus endorsement on it you can't drive a
 
01:27:24.290 --> 01:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school bus without that
 
01:27:26.209 --> 01:27:26.219 align:start position:0%
second document that we regulate and
 
01:27:29.050 --> 01:27:29.060 align:start position:0%
that's only regulated under 259.96 and
 
01:27:34.129 --> 01:27:34.139 align:start position:0%
263.29 the 1300 rules it's 96a forget it
 
01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
all they don't need that document it's
 
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
gone they only need is that license for
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
what they're driving and we can get all
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
the complaints in the world that these
 
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
kids are being driven unsafely and I
 
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
can't do a thing about it under in my
 
01:27:44.689 --> 01:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
office so
 
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
it's that's basically it so if there's a
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
cross reference making reference that if
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
this is all well and good and there's a
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
note in there saying yep they have but
 
01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
they still need to comply with 259.96
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
and 263.29 I that should alleviate the
 
01:27:58.669 --> 01:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
concern of the state with this bill
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
because like I said in the beginning
 
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
this is already something that can be
 
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
accomplished from my office's
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
perspective so thank you very much
 
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher quickly we have
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
somebody yes just one brief one
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
obviously I think in order to understand
 
01:28:13.729 --> 01:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
the relatively any safety concerns that
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
exists we also need to understand the
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
efficacy of the current process
 
01:28:20.209 --> 01:28:20.219 align:start position:0%
um so can you speak to do any knowledge
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
of Statistics or anything like that
 
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
involving incidents or injuries
 
01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
involving school buses on a yearly basis
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
perhaps or anything like that
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
I actually can I can't write now because
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
I don't have it uh in front of me but I
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
did do a project similar to this about
 
01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
the safety of school buses uh
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
specifically with uh seat belts and you
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
know the the desire to put seat belts on
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
buses and what the need for that is and
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
what the statistics showed and stuff
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
like that that's a close approx thing I
 
01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
can show you
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
um but I can't provide it right now okay
 
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:53.940 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that so thank you are there
 
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
not seeing anything thank you very much
 
01:28:58.729 --> 01:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the thorough
 
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
discussion very good Sergeant I'd make
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
on this one
 
01:29:12.110 --> 01:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
no so we're going to close the hearing
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
that we have on 651 and we will get
 
01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
ready for the next hearing which is 3
 
01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:41.770 align:start position:0%
ready for the next hearing which is 3

01:29:41.770 --> 01:29:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay we'll uh open up the hearing on

will introduce the bill
 
01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:31.510 align:start position:0%
will introduce the bill
foreign

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative cortelli and cordelli and

from Haverhill the Haverhill New
 
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not the Massachusetts
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
and representing a number of communities
 
01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
around Haverhill as well today I'm here
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
to introduce uh the bill which we have
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
before you 349 this bill deals with uh
 
01:30:58.970 --> 01:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater Hebron and Groton and talks
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
about discusses the possibility of a a
 
01:31:06.169 --> 01:31:06.179 align:start position:0%
school district that would be formed I'm
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
not going to take a whole lot of time in
 
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:09.780 align:start position:0%
this presentation seeing I know we have
 
01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
a crowd behind me that's probably most
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
likely wanting to talk on this
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
particular Bill however I did hand out
 
01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
to you one sheet that I want you to be
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
aware of that back in 1997 this
 
01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.050 align:start position:0%
aware of that back in 1997 this
legislature

01:31:26.050 --> 01:31:26.060 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
provided and I'll read that language
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's on that front page there I don't
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
have the whole statue copied for you but
 
01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
allows the establishment of a village
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
special Village District
 
01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
for the towns of Hebron and Bridgewater
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
to construct own and maintain a public
 
01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
school facility
 
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
so was this legislature that approved
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
this particular Community to have a
 
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
Village School
 
01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:55.910 align:start position:0%
Village School
however

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature never authorized that
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
particular Community to be a school
 
01:32:01.679 --> 01:32:04.490 align:start position:0%
particular Community to be a school
district

01:32:04.490 --> 01:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
the village now has constructed does
 
01:32:10.729 --> 01:32:10.739 align:start position:0%
maintain and has a facility for
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
elementary students
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
It's a Wonderful it's a beautiful
 
01:32:14.639 --> 01:32:15.830 align:start position:0%
It's a Wonderful it's a beautiful
facility

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:32:19.629 --> 01:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
good property around it safe secure
 
01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
modern the ability to add on to it if
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
necessary but at current time I don't
 
01:32:29.330 --> 01:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
think that's necessary but if you we
 
01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
extend it to a middle school it would
 
01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
probably need some additional classrooms
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
which the the uh it's already built into
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
that current facility how to add on and
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
tag off the the structure and
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure within the building so
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
looking at this school uh the district
 
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh possibly would happen here
 
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
there's a number of questions which we
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
want to look at what does this bill do
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
it provides Bridgewater Hebron and
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
Groton that already have in this school
 
01:33:02.830 --> 01:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
to own and owned by the Bridgewater
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
Village district and by the way that
 
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
whole building is leased to the Newfound
 
01:33:10.370 --> 01:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
school district for one dollar a year
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
and the responsibility for maintaining
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
that building is that a Bridgewater not
 
01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.610 align:start position:0%
that building is that a Bridgewater not
Newfound

01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
Newfound
 
01:33:19.850 --> 01:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
and so the citizens of Bridgewater and
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hebron are are really maintaining and
 
01:33:25.129 --> 01:33:25.139 align:start position:0%
operating that building
 
01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh at their own expense not that of the
 
01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
expense of the school district
 
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
how does the creation of the new school
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
district take place well this bill
 
01:33:37.729 --> 01:33:37.739 align:start position:0%
stipulates that the three towns up gives
 
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
the towns up to three uh four years on
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
which to study and plan for the
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
potential of creating a new school
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
district it's not something by passing
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
this bill something automatically
 
01:33:47.699 --> 01:33:48.950 align:start position:0%
this bill something automatically
happens

01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
how will children be educated well the
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
students are currently educated in the
 
01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
elementary school for the Elementary
 
01:33:57.169 --> 01:33:57.179 align:start position:0%
grades and then they go to the
 
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
Newfoundland school district for the
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
middle school and the high school years
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
the intent of the the where the end zone
 
01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
for this particular bill would be is
 
01:34:11.689 --> 01:34:11.699 align:start position:0%
that the high school students upon
 
01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
coming out of a middle school in
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater and a elementary school
 
01:34:18.649 --> 01:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
would then be tuitioned and tuitioned
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
either to Newfound and that would be
 
01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
negotiated or tuition to another school
 
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's nearby just a few short miles up
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
um going down what are the benefits of
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
creating this new school district well
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's basically going to give local
 
01:34:37.010 --> 01:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
control to that local facility the new
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
school district also presents Revenue
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities to Newfoundland area
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
if Newfound is willing to enter into a
 
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
fair tuition agreement it will have the
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
benefit of a revenue stream that will
 
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
allow it to move forward with its
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
desired capital projects and needs that
 
01:34:59.090 --> 01:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
they may foresee using that tuition rate
 
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
that comes out of the possibly of a new
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
form District by the way this is a
 
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
highly unusual situation in our state I
 
01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
believe the only one in the state where
 
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
the Village School is owned by The
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
Village not the that the Cooperative or
 
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
not the school administrative unit it's
 
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
owned by that Village
 
01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
what problems does this bill solve it
 
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
allows a greater local focus on
 
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
educational quality and I believe this
 
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
is the whole intent of the bill
 
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is to have
 
01:35:36.169 --> 01:35:36.179 align:start position:0%
achievement and growth of the students
 
01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
the way those people in that Community
 
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
are looking to see that occur
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
by right-sizing the two resulting school
 
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
districts if this occurs it allows for
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
an equitable apportionment of District
 
01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
operating costs in both districts it
 
01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
pertains potentially will strengthen the
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
Newfound Area School District by
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
allowing for tuition Revenue as a
 
01:35:59.689 --> 01:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
potential offset to taxes incurred by
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
the remaining towns
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
does this bill mean that we are
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
withdrawn from the Newfoundland area
 
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
school district we meaning the bridge
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
now uh Bridgewater in Hebron and Groton
 
01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:11.689 align:start position:0%
now uh Bridgewater in Hebron and Groton
no

01:36:11.689 --> 01:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
the bill authorizes a unique opportunity
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
for the three towns to vote to create a
 
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
school district there's a long process
 
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
spelled out in this in this legislation
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
which would for afford this process to
 
01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:25.850 align:start position:0%
which would for afford this process to
begin

01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
begin
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
won't this bill require that we hire new
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
Administration not necessarily
 
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
other school districts have successfully
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
no get negotiated contacts with a
 
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
neighboring SAU to provide
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
superintendent Services if you also look
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
in statute there's another area within
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
statute which allows them to have a
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
principal slash administrator take on
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities of the
 
01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
superintendent that's current statutory
 
01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:50.030 align:start position:0%
superintendent that's current statutory
law

01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.490 align:start position:0%
law
foreign

01:36:51.490 --> 01:36:51.500 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
detrimental to other Cooperative school
 
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
districts know this bill deals with a
 
01:36:57.770 --> 01:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
very unique set of facts where the
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
students who comprise the district will
 
01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
be educated in a school that is already
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
owned by the two or three towns through
 
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
the Bridgewater Hebron Village District
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
no other towns in New Hampshire have
 
01:37:12.050 --> 01:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
such a situation and this bill does not
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
apply to any other Cooperative school
 
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
districts this bill has nothing to do
 
01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:19.139 align:start position:0%
with Cooperative disillusionment has
 
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with apportionment as far
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
as you know how many votes once uh one's
 
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
district has first another District in
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
The Cooperative it has nothing to do
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
with all that statutory uh references
 
01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
and issues we've discussed in past this
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
is a unique Bill associated with that
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
particular Village district and has
 
01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
nothing to do it's tearing apart or
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
trying to shred our concept and
 
01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
structure of Cooperative school
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
districts I won't talk anymore because
 
01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
we have a boatload of people behind me
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
that want to talk about this and uh I
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
would be willing to take questions but I
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
prefer that you if you're looking for
 
01:37:59.209 --> 01:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
issues such as Financial costs bonding
 
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
all that uh Transportation etc etc uh
 
01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
you can ask those people that are
 
01:38:05.209 --> 01:38:05.219 align:start position:0%
following up behind me
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you
 
01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking this uh
 
01:38:14.890 --> 01:38:14.900 align:start position:0%
just two pots
 
01:38:17.570 --> 01:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
in the legislation you're talking about
 
01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
the three towns and the peace that you
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
gave us as the handle they talked about
 
01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
the two is there any how does Groton get
 
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
in here in this I think that's a good
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
question the Groton has it's very small
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
and yes you're right Hebron and
 
01:38:32.450 --> 01:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater are the folks that were
 
01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
spelled out in that legislation back in
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
97 uh Groton is a community which would
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
be there in the garage relationship with
 
01:38:43.850 --> 01:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater and and Hebron you should be
 
01:38:45.169 --> 01:38:45.179 align:start position:0%
asked to the folks which are coming up
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
there's knowledgeable people that are on
 
01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
the select boards School
 
01:38:52.129 --> 01:38:52.139 align:start position:0%
Etc is sitting behind me in the the
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you um how many students
 
01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
are we talking about that's another good
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
question from
 
01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I'm trying to get off the hook
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
here so they can get in because you're
 
01:39:02.570 --> 01:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
going to get specifics behind
 
01:39:04.010 --> 01:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
representative Damon rather than me
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
giving approximations I could give you
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
an approximation
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
I just want a clarification on the two
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
words special purpose
 
01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
what that means it seems like the bill
 
01:39:20.209 --> 01:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
reads so where it says relative to a
 
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
special purpose School District no it's
 
01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
not it's not a special purpose School
 
01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
District it's a municipal Village they
 
01:39:33.530 --> 01:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
have their Commissioners they were but
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
they also own their building and they
 
01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
raise the Monies to maintain and equip
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
that building
 
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
but they don't they're not school
 
01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
districts so they can't go any further
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
than that
 
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.790 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
so

01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
special purpose bill this District on
 
01:39:55.729 --> 01:39:55.739 align:start position:0%
line two of the first page but on the
 
01:39:57.169 --> 01:39:57.179 align:start position:0%
front page it says special purpose
 
01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
School District so that was my confusion
 
01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
are you looking at which Roman numeral
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
so on
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
the face page
 
01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:11.149 align:start position:0%
the face page
analysis

01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
where it says an act relative to a
 
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
special purpose School District see this
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
act right here that you see it's a
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
combination of Exeter and others as well
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
so it's it's
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
no nothing else Omnibus bills that we
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
had as a house
 
01:40:27.169 --> 01:40:27.179 align:start position:0%
or you're looking in the
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
the bill right there that would be a
 
01:40:31.729 --> 01:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
good question for them when they come up
 
01:40:33.370 --> 01:40:33.380 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you thank
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%

01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:59.290 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

01:40:59.290 --> 01:40:59.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.620 align:start position:0%

this is a multi-price steps process the

first step is to hold a vote in

Bridgewater Hebron and Groton to

um to a K-8 allows us to continue our

proven how to prevent The Proven High

accountability and sound discipline
 
01:44:14.209 --> 01:44:14.219 align:start position:0%
through the eighth grade it would allow
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
more effective local control better
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
managed educational costs and give
 
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
parents an Innovative alternative to
 
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
traditional Middle School today's
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
parents are becoming more engaged in the

educational outcomes for their children
 
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
there is a growing Trend towards
 
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
alternative education options and in our
 
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
local case a trend towards the public
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
a28 model given this bill given this
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
climate the bill gives us the authority
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
in this and the time to thoughtfully
 
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
think this through
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
we would seek to stay closely aligned
 
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
and work cooperatively with the Newfound
 
01:44:48.169 --> 01:44:48.179 align:start position:0%
Area School District to support quality
 
01:44:49.729 --> 01:44:49.739 align:start position:0%
education for the children
 
01:44:52.330 --> 01:44:52.340 align:start position:0%
we would support space-based
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreements for grades uh K-8
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
by inviting students from other towns to
 
01:44:59.209 --> 01:44:59.219 align:start position:0%
intend we would offer parents a choice
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
between traditional middle school and a
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
k-28 program we would seek a Cooperative
 
01:45:03.239 --> 01:45:04.550 align:start position:0%
k-28 program we would seek a Cooperative
relationship

01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
01:45:07.129 --> 01:45:07.139 align:start position:0%
this bill gives us an option to create
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
our own district and to reconfigure to a
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
k-28 we have four years to research and
 
01:45:13.370 --> 01:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
determine if this is the best choice for
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:16.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
in the end our voters will decide House
 
01:45:22.729 --> 01:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
Bill 349 provides a narrow singular fix
 
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
that would realign us with the state's
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
Publications a publication model this
 
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
bill is a turnkey solution that our
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
final education plan must be improved by
 
01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:33.659 align:start position:0%
the Board of Education finally we as
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
citizens have a responsibility to
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
provide our children's public education
 
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
this bill provides that opportunity
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you now questions from
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:47.580 align:start position:0%

thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
question I just want to make clear that
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
um does this create another SAU a
 
01:45:58.010 --> 01:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
um probably yes
 
01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's gonna it's gonna emerge
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
something really special purpose that
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
was a term that spun off from the
 
01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:09.659 align:start position:0%
original legislation ultimately what
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
we're doing is basically taking and
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
going to the next step to be able to be
 
01:46:17.209 --> 01:46:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%

01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
however there is another critical factor
 
01:48:47.689 --> 01:48:47.699 align:start position:0%
in our state's national achievements the

and fellowship so needed in our society
 
01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:02.699 align:start position:0%
perseverance is especially evident when
 
01:50:04.729 --> 01:50:04.739 align:start position:0%
in 1999 the communities of Bridgewater
 
01:50:06.410 --> 01:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
and Hebron joined to construct a modern
 
01:50:09.050 --> 01:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
School building open to all towns in the

existing Cooperative School District
 
01:50:17.330 --> 01:50:17.340 align:start position:0%

leased the facility the school district
 
01:50:20.930 --> 01:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
for one dollar per year
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
the maintenance and building upgrade
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
costs are the sole responsibility of the

enhanced program configuration
 
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
Recent research on Pre-K and K-8 school

configuration has continued to grow
 
01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
focusing on the importance of children's

Society intuitive leaders in our state
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
might consider looking at the multiple

01:51:37.609 --> 01:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
a school with community support and a
 
01:51:39.410 --> 01:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
belief that citizens owned the school
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
with an intense commitment to success
 
01:51:44.810 --> 01:51:44.820 align:start position:0%

01:51:55.129 --> 01:51:55.139 align:start position:0%
the three towns choices to support these
 
01:51:57.709 --> 01:51:57.719 align:start position:0%
critical years of development a K-8

01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
protect and educate their children only
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
strengthen our state thank you for this
 
01:52:30.770 --> 01:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share my thoughts on this
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
worthy proposal despite the challenges
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
facing our nation I believe that New
 
01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will continue to leave the
 
01:52:39.590 --> 01:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
country in educational success and
 
01:52:41.149 --> 01:52:41.159 align:start position:0%
promote and Safeguard our children and
 
01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
communities respectfully submitted

Virginia M Barry PhD
 
01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time
 
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
okay I'll take over but I don't ask any
 
01:52:54.590 --> 01:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
questions or anything like that seeing
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
that you know I presented the bill are
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative miler
 
01:53:02.689 --> 01:53:02.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
being here and sharing uh Dr Berry's uh
 
01:53:08.209 --> 01:53:08.219 align:start position:0%
comment she was an outstanding
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education
 
01:53:13.129 --> 01:53:13.139 align:start position:0%
the concern that I have is I'm a little
 
01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
confused I understand the movement of
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
five to eight uh or Pre-K to eight
 
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
rather than Pre-K to five could you
 
01:53:24.169 --> 01:53:24.179 align:start position:0%
outline for the committee what is the
 
01:53:25.609 --> 01:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
current status
 
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
what it looks like and as you deal with
 
01:53:31.729 --> 01:53:31.739 align:start position:0%
this proposal how would it change what
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
would it what would it look like
 
01:53:33.719 --> 01:53:35.410 align:start position:0%
would it what would it look like
differently

01:53:35.410 --> 01:53:35.420 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:53:38.810 --> 01:53:38.820 align:start position:0%
well right now it's pre-k through five
 
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
and it would be I'm not sure Pre-K or k
 
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
through eight of course this has yet to
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
be determined this there's going to be
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
if this is passed then it will be looked
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
at very carefully as to how it is
 
01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
exactly going to look going forward I
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
know that the facility though was built
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
to house a k through eight because I'm
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
on that committee
 
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
and we kept that in mind when we were
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
building that school thinking that a K-8
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
model would be great right now A K-8 is
 
01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
not something that the Newfound area
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
school district is looking at doing so
 
01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
that is one of the big reasons why we
 
01:54:17.209 --> 01:54:17.219 align:start position:0%
want to do that ourselves
 
01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
follow up please yes I guess my concern
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
is is that I don't know from an
 
01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
administrative standpoint
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
how would it change I understand that
 
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
the children the students who currently
 
01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
go six to eight obviously go to another
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
another area that I understand that but
 
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
I'm just how does what's the
 
01:54:40.129 --> 01:54:40.139 align:start position:0%
administrative piece look like with this
 
01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
proposal vis-a-vis what is the current
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
administrative structure
 
01:54:48.649 --> 01:54:48.659 align:start position:0%
I'm I don't know that I can necessarily
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
answer that the best um it is I can tell
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
you that it's yet to be determined
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
exactly how that will look the options
 
01:54:56.570 --> 01:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
need to be are the options are out there
 
01:54:58.970 --> 01:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be looked at right now
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
that school is under the sau4 so the
 
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the entire School
 
01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.510 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the entire School
District

01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
um looks after that school and we have
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
our own principal at Bridgewater Hebron
 
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
Village school but how that exactly will
 
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
end up being is as far as I know you
 
01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
have to be determined but others can
 
01:55:18.890 --> 01:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
answer that better than than I can very
 
01:55:20.689 --> 01:55:20.699 align:start position:0%
good so I hope somebody can answer my
 
01:55:23.770 --> 01:55:23.780 align:start position:0%
question on that thank you very much
 
01:55:25.870 --> 01:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock thank you
 
01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning good morning just
 
01:55:32.689 --> 01:55:32.699 align:start position:0%
a couple follow-ups I had to share all
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
that he said that someone would be
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
helping that would be you I guess
 
01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
um just how many youngsters in the K-5
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
system now in your building and how many
 
01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
edition of youngsters would be taking
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
from six to eight if you expand
 
01:55:46.370 --> 01:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
I don't have those numbers in front of
 
01:55:48.910 --> 01:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
me I wish I could tell you that but
 
01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:55.970 --> 01:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
and man
 
01:55:58.250 --> 01:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
and so what I'll read it that way what
 
01:56:00.649 --> 01:56:00.659 align:start position:0%
was six to eight look like
 
01:56:02.510 --> 01:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
well anymore
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you both
 
01:56:07.129 --> 01:56:07.139 align:start position:0%

01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
written testimony too yeah we'll get
 
01:56:10.010 --> 01:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
more questions but if you have written
 
01:56:12.649 --> 01:56:12.659 align:start position:0%
testimony if could you submit it to the
 
01:56:14.209 --> 01:56:14.219 align:start position:0%
clerk so we can make it part of the
 
01:56:18.370 --> 01:56:18.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%

01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
elementary schools are in the uh SAU for
 
01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
currently there are four is that correct
 
01:56:30.649 --> 01:56:30.659 align:start position:0%
yes including Bridgewater human Village
 
01:56:32.090 --> 01:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
School thank you we have the
 
01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:35.880 align:start position:0%

thank you very much I appreciate it
 
01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
welcome again good morning and uh thank
 
01:56:58.850 --> 01:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to speak I'm going
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
to speak against the bill today
 
01:57:05.209 --> 01:57:05.219 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to first uh
 
01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative lad you and it's been
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple times that the
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
village district is responsible for all
 
01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the maintenance of that building
 
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's not true it's shared uh the
 
01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
village District takes care of the
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
larger items like recently they put a
 
01:57:22.010 --> 01:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
new roof on the building things like
 
01:57:25.129 --> 01:57:25.139 align:start position:0%
that but we hire the custodial staff and
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
we maintain it that way we clean the
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
building it's a shared class it's not
 
01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:31.250 align:start position:0%
building it's a shared class it's not
fully

01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
fully
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
um funded by The Village District so
 
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
first uh to speak to what is obvious to
 
01:57:39.890 --> 01:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
me about one of the troubling spots of
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
this house bill is to me it looks like
 
01:57:43.609 --> 01:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
it's going to set a precedent and it's
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
going to circumvent
 
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
um RSA 195 which we already have in
 
01:57:53.570 --> 01:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
place uh to allow towns to explore the
 
01:57:55.490 --> 01:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
possibility of withdrawal from from
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
Cooperative districts
 
01:57:57.719 --> 01:57:58.790 align:start position:0%
Cooperative districts
um this

01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
um this
 
01:58:01.129 --> 01:58:01.139 align:start position:0%
um this was already done once in 2014
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
with Bridgewater and Hebron and they
 
01:58:07.490 --> 01:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
they followed the RSA 195 and it was
 
01:58:09.169 --> 01:58:09.179 align:start position:0%
determined at the end of the study to
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
remain in the district
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater Hebron and Groton have been
 
01:58:15.290 --> 01:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
part of the Newfound area school
 
01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
district for over 60 years
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
collectively they have about 15 percent
 
01:58:23.169 --> 01:58:23.179 align:start position:0%
of the students that attend our schools
 
01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
people should remember that the
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District was formed to
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
create efficiencies that all seven
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
pounds and those students would benefit
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
from and to provide greater educational
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities for their students so this
 
01:58:40.609 --> 01:58:40.619 align:start position:0%
is clear clearly the point of
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
Cooperative districts across the whole
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
states students from the small towns
 
01:58:47.209 --> 01:58:47.219 align:start position:0%
have much more to gain than students
 
01:58:48.649 --> 01:58:48.659 align:start position:0%
from the large towns because they're
 
01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:51.719 align:start position:0%
able to attend schools in in a larger
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
setting a larger high school because
 
01:58:56.450 --> 01:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
they they belong to the Cooperative
 
01:58:58.129 --> 01:58:58.139 align:start position:0%
District they that they would otherwise
 
01:59:00.169 --> 01:59:00.179 align:start position:0%
not benefit from and with those larger
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
schools comes greater programming the
 
01:59:06.410 --> 01:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
students benefited tremendously by being
 
01:59:08.209 --> 01:59:08.219 align:start position:0%
part of Newfoundland they've attended
 
01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
larger schools they've been able to
 
01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
access academic programs Athletics and
 
01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
co-curricular programs that they would
 
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
not have been able to access if they
 
01:59:18.649 --> 01:59:18.659 align:start position:0%
weren't proud of the Cooperative
 
01:59:21.290 --> 01:59:21.300 align:start position:0%
District these programs and efficiencies
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
have been guaranteed if if these three
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
towns leave the Newfound school district
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
those students may lose that guarantee
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
to have that access when your part when
 
01:59:34.129 --> 01:59:34.139 align:start position:0%
you're locked into a Cooperative
 
01:59:36.649 --> 01:59:36.659 align:start position:0%
District you have those those guarantees
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's a risk here as the Newfound area
 
01:59:43.209 --> 01:59:43.219 align:start position:0%
school district is planning their future
 
01:59:46.189 --> 01:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
we now have an architectural study and a
 
01:59:48.050 --> 01:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
building committee that are looking at
 
01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
three of our elementary schools that are
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
aging and need either to be replaced or
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
to be renovated so as this would leave
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
if this bill was passed it would leave
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
that Committee in a really difficult
 
02:00:05.890 --> 02:00:05.900 align:start position:0%
position how do we plan going forward
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
not knowing if there's a four-year
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
process as described today for the
 
02:00:14.050 --> 02:00:14.060 align:start position:0%
um for this group to study that
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
personally I'm frustrated that the house
 
02:00:19.250 --> 02:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
bill was written in isolation
 
02:00:22.850 --> 02:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
we just it just appeared to us it was
 
02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:23.830 align:start position:0%
we just it just appeared to us it was
never

02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
never
 
02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
discussed or presented at a school board
 
02:00:30.290 --> 02:00:30.300 align:start position:0%
meeting I attended several meetings
 
02:00:32.270 --> 02:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the summer on the funding
 
02:00:35.450 --> 02:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
formula with Mr Murphy and Mr Piper
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
who's here today and neither of them
 
02:00:39.530 --> 02:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned it to me and that that is
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
troubling that we could have been part
 
02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
of the process
 
02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
um some of the things that have been
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
shared as supporting documents for this
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
house bill include negative uh comments
 
02:00:54.109 --> 02:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
about Middle School our Middle School is
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
doing great I mean that was a a
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
narrative that was in place in 2014.
 
02:01:02.570 --> 02:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
that's really old news we our middle
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
school has new leadership and they're
 
02:01:08.209 --> 02:01:08.219 align:start position:0%
um performing at or above the state
 
02:01:11.410 --> 02:01:11.420 align:start position:0%
average the district has also made huge
 
02:01:14.530 --> 02:01:14.540 align:start position:0%
investments into that building
 
02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
putting in a new uh state-of-the-art
 
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
HVAC system and LED lighting recently
 
02:01:22.850 --> 02:01:22.860 align:start position:0%
and we have a facilities committee
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's continually looking at improving
 
02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
that facility there was in the
 
02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
supporting documents speaks about one
 
02:01:36.050 --> 02:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
the fear of losing or change of funding
 
02:01:38.689 --> 02:01:38.699 align:start position:0%
formula within the district that issue
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
was resolved last year with a petition
 
02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%
Warren article which was modified to
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
form a study committee and we spent the
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
summer and some of these people behind
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
me were on that committee and it was
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
found that we weren't going to change
 
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
the funding formula so I I don't see
 
02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
that as a fear
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
um if so currently there was a question
 
02:02:03.169 --> 02:02:03.179 align:start position:0%
about the enrollment uh currently at
 
02:02:05.570 --> 02:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater Hebron we have on our books
 
02:02:09.129 --> 02:02:09.139 align:start position:0%
as a 121 students
 
02:02:13.149 --> 02:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
Alexandria or Bristol so if this house
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
bill was the past and Newfound Area
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
School District could pull those
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
students back into our own buildings
 
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
that would be a 35 percent decrease in
 
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment and put you about 77 students
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
also as part of our planning for our
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
district moving forward we've haven't
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
had an enrollment study by the New
 
02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
England Council of school development
 
02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
and they're predicting a 12 decrease in
 
02:02:46.129 --> 02:02:46.139 align:start position:0%
enrollment in the next 10 years so based
 
02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
on those declining numbers it's really
 
02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
high to imagine that adding more grades
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
to one of our smaller schools really
 
02:02:56.810 --> 02:02:56.820 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
02:02:56.820 --> 02:02:57.890 align:start position:0%
makes sense
um

02:02:57.890 --> 02:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:01.370 --> 02:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
let me see that's all I have to say a
 
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
little bit of that thank you very much
 
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
superintendent are there any questions
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Tanner
 
02:03:08.570 --> 02:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
question so there's there's four
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
elementary schools in the district
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
including the Village School
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
um if they
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
they all follow
 
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the same guidelines as far
 
02:03:24.169 --> 02:03:24.179 align:start position:0%
as curriculum and uh we are all yes we
 
02:03:26.990 --> 02:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh before elementary schools use all the
 
02:03:29.689 --> 02:03:29.699 align:start position:0%
same curriculum and assessment tools I
 
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
mean essentially when it comes to
 
02:03:33.649 --> 02:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
instruction they're essentially like one
 
02:03:37.550 --> 02:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
school and and as a follow-up and you've
 
02:03:41.209 --> 02:03:41.219 align:start position:0%
uh hire all the employees for for all
 
02:03:43.129 --> 02:03:43.139 align:start position:0%
four elementary schools at this point
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's correct everybody that works in
 
02:03:48.109 --> 02:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
that building from custodial staff all
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
the way up through the teachers and
 
02:03:52.609 --> 02:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
administrator our Newfound
 
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
um employees thank you representative
 
02:03:55.020 --> 02:03:56.510 align:start position:0%
um employees thank you representative

uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
superintendent for being here
 
02:04:02.570 --> 02:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
um you talked about the projected
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment decline do you have any idea
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
um what this school the high school
 
02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
capacity is right now in terms of space
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
utilization at the high school yeah it
 
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
was built for about 500 students and
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
currently we have about 380 okay thank
 
02:04:22.129 --> 02:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
you follow up yes
 
02:04:22.139 --> 02:04:22.790 align:start position:0%
you follow up yes
um

02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh you talked about the four-year window
 
02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:27.109 align:start position:0%
uh you talked about the four-year window
also

02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:04:28.970 --> 02:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
um and I understand from previous
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
02:04:34.129 --> 02:04:34.139 align:start position:0%
um if this four-year uh
 
02:04:36.770 --> 02:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
planning period results in a new school
 
02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:37.790 align:start position:0%
planning period results in a new school
district

02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:04:39.410 --> 02:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
um they would be looking to tuition
 
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:41.149 align:start position:0%
um they would be looking to tuition
students

02:04:41.149 --> 02:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
um to back to Newfound or to Plymouth or
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
some other place would Newfound be open
 
02:04:50.030 --> 02:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
with especially with the declining
 
02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
enrollment and excess capacity uh be
 
02:04:56.290 --> 02:04:56.300 align:start position:0%
looking to accept
 
02:04:59.390 --> 02:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
students from the new District as
 
02:05:01.970 --> 02:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
tuition students well that would be a
 
02:05:04.910 --> 02:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
school board decision not my decision I
 
02:05:06.770 --> 02:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
mean I can tell you that there's a lot
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
of frustration with the other towns
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
about this house bill and you know the
 
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
feeling like you know they're not we're
 
02:05:17.450 --> 02:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
not good enough for them now why would
 
02:05:19.370 --> 02:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
we accept them back type of thing but
 
02:05:20.689 --> 02:05:20.699 align:start position:0%
that would be really up to the school
 
02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:23.219 align:start position:0%
board to decide and in the matter of if
 
02:05:26.089 --> 02:05:26.099 align:start position:0%
it came down to three or four years how
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
would um it could be an entirely
 
02:05:29.930 --> 02:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
different you know school board at that
 
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
point but so it's really hard to tell
 
02:05:34.129 --> 02:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
but it really puts us uh the building
 
02:05:36.770 --> 02:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
Committee in a difficult position as we
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
move forward and make plans trying to
 
02:05:41.330 --> 02:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
decide whether Bridgewater Hebron and
 
02:05:45.169 --> 02:05:45.179 align:start position:0%
glottner with Newfound or not
 
02:05:47.450 --> 02:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
committee representative woodcock
 
02:05:51.050 --> 02:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman come on
 
02:05:53.089 --> 02:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
superintendent welcome
 
02:05:55.250 --> 02:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
um I have two two questions that they're
 
02:05:57.290 --> 02:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
distinctly different uh just at the
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
onset of your discussion you indicated I
 
02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
think he said it was determinist that
 
02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
the conclusion one is determined to stay
 
02:06:05.450 --> 02:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's not of the district the study that
 
02:06:06.589 --> 02:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
we're done right
 
02:06:08.330 --> 02:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
it determined the state is part of the
 
02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
district right that was in 2014 okay my
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
question is by whom
 
02:06:14.209 --> 02:06:14.219 align:start position:0%
they formed the committee which is
 
02:06:17.930 --> 02:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
required by the irsa and I think some of
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
the people sitting behind me weren't
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
part of that committee I saw the
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
documents and markets this one and made
 
02:06:25.370 --> 02:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
the second part yes go ahead thank you
 
02:06:29.870 --> 02:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
um is the pay scale for the teachers and
 
02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
the Four elementary school districts all
 
02:06:34.970 --> 02:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
the same yes thank you thank you Mr
 
02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
further questions representative miler
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:06:40.729 --> 02:06:40.739 align:start position:0%
being here I'll ask you the
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
administrative question how do you see
 
02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
from your perspective the administration
 
02:06:48.830 --> 02:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
of this particular proposal vis-a-vis
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
what is currently there
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
well uh they would so if they succeeded
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
and and formed their own District they
 
02:07:00.050 --> 02:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
would need a principal which they are
 
02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:02.820 align:start position:0%
you know we already have that we pay we
 
02:07:06.350 --> 02:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
pay for 2.6 million dollars every year
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
for the budget for that school Newfound
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
does for Staffing it and maintaining it
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
so they would need a principal and
 
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
certainly one principle would be capable
 
02:07:17.450 --> 02:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
of a k to eight but as you know
 
02:07:18.890 --> 02:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
um the school the school would be
 
02:07:20.810 --> 02:07:20.820 align:start position:0%
required to have
 
02:07:23.930 --> 02:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
um to acquire superintendent services so
 
02:07:25.609 --> 02:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
they would either have to hire a
 
02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
full-time superintendent or find some
 
02:07:31.729 --> 02:07:31.739 align:start position:0%
other way to to fulfill those services
 
02:07:34.609 --> 02:07:34.619 align:start position:0%
follow up yes uh then other services
 
02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
that are currently provided by the SIU
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
would they continue to do that to this
 
02:07:42.050 --> 02:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
new this new entity well that would be
 
02:07:44.089 --> 02:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
up to the to the school board to decide
 
02:07:44.099 --> 02:07:45.109 align:start position:0%
up to the to the school board to decide
that

02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:48.589 --> 02:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
that's not a guarantee thank you
 
02:07:49.850 --> 02:07:49.860 align:start position:0%

The Village school education performance
 
02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:43.260 align:start position:0%

02:09:58.570 --> 02:09:58.580 align:start position:0%
our kids and students love that school
 
02:10:01.129 --> 02:10:01.139 align:start position:0%
I'm very excited about this bill and
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
feel it will set their children up for
 
02:10:05.930 --> 02:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
continued success as a father myself I
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of stability
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
in the educational system
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
establishing a three-school district and
 
02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:18.290 --> 02:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
will will create a more effective
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
control over the school system
 
02:10:21.890 --> 02:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
a stronger tight link between the
 
02:10:24.050 --> 02:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
parents and schools
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
less transition for the children
 
02:10:27.890 --> 02:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
and expand the Village Schools
 
02:10:29.810 --> 02:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
successful proven educational model for
 
02:10:31.850 --> 02:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
an additional three years up to grade
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
eight our parents are becoming more
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
involved in education of our children
 
02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
and as you know there's a growing Trend
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
towards public education Alternatives in
 
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
our case the trend is the public K-8
 
02:10:43.500 --> 02:10:45.470 align:start position:0%
our case the trend is the public K-8
school

02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
smaller is also better we're situated at
 
02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
the far end of the largest school
 
02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
district our kids spend several hours on
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
the school bus each day and as they
 
02:10:54.770 --> 02:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
drive past the Village School on their
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
way to the Middle School
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
establishing a three-town school
 
02:10:59.930 --> 02:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
district and reconfiguring it to three
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
through k-8 will help alleviate that
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
challenge for our children
 
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
I also support this bill because it
 
02:11:07.669 --> 02:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
gives us four years to thoroughly engage
 
02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
our citizens and thoughtfully think
 
02:11:12.169 --> 02:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
through the reconfiguration
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
I seriously take responsibility to
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
provide the best public education for
 
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
our children this bill is unique
 
02:11:20.209 --> 02:11:20.219 align:start position:0%
Innovative and an Innovative opportunity
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
to do just that thank you for listening
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
thank you questions represent paternal
 
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm not sure if
 
02:11:31.609 --> 02:11:31.619 align:start position:0%
you're the correct person to ask this
 
02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:33.599 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering what some of the
 
02:11:36.589 --> 02:11:36.599 align:start position:0%
benefits of K through 8 as opposed to K
 
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
through five might be because that seems
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be a significant change from what the
 
02:11:43.729 --> 02:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
school is currently there's two things
 
02:11:43.739 --> 02:11:44.930 align:start position:0%
school is currently there's two things
one

02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:11:47.330 --> 02:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
the school is doing exceptional as far
 
02:11:49.370 --> 02:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
as the testing so it enhances it gives
 
02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
them another three years for just that
 
02:11:53.450 --> 02:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
and also our children do spend several
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
hours on the bus because that only goes
 
02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
to grade five so it's three years that
 
02:11:58.970 --> 02:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
they're going to middle school
 
02:12:00.410 --> 02:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
um it'll help
 
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
them spend more time in the school less
 
02:12:04.330 --> 02:12:04.340 align:start position:0%
time in the bus
 
02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
and it also there's less transition for
 
02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
the students so they'll have more time
 
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
with stability being in that same school
 
02:12:12.169 --> 02:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
for an additional three years I think
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
they'll greatly benefit from from those
 
02:12:13.679 --> 02:12:15.890 align:start position:0%
they'll greatly benefit from from those
things

02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Tanner
 
02:12:20.689 --> 02:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:12:20.699 --> 02:12:21.890 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

02:12:21.890 --> 02:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:12:23.689 --> 02:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you've probably studied the
 
02:12:25.490 --> 02:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
financial part of this but I'm I'm
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
wondering what it actually does to the
 
02:12:29.810 --> 02:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
to the tax rate
 
02:12:32.629 --> 02:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
um in in particular your town will make
 
02:12:35.450 --> 02:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
a difference one way or the other and
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
also the increased costs for the
 
02:12:40.850 --> 02:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
uh and narrow's Nation Eric can speak
 
02:12:43.250 --> 02:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
better to that but um this is not about
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh lowering taxes or anything that's
 
02:12:47.570 --> 02:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
strictly about the education for those
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
students and making sure that they
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
succeed in in life
 
02:12:55.370 --> 02:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much thank you
 
02:13:10.209 --> 02:13:10.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:20.810 --> 02:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
well thank you for having me and uh I
 
02:13:22.669 --> 02:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
want to say I have great respect for the
 
02:13:25.609 --> 02:13:25.619 align:start position:0%
process here and I'm interested in in
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
participating I was on the 2014 study
 
02:13:30.410 --> 02:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
group if that helps
 
02:13:32.209 --> 02:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
I don't have that in my presentation but
 
02:13:35.089 --> 02:13:35.099 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer questions
 
02:13:36.770 --> 02:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to represent the town of
 
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
Hebron I've been a select board member
 
02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
for 10 years I have two other members
 
02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
with me in the back Rich James on this
 
02:13:45.669 --> 02:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
side and Paul Hazelton here
 
02:13:48.410 --> 02:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh the town of Hebron and the select
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
board we support this bill
 
02:13:53.569 --> 02:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
uh personally myself I want to State I
 
02:13:56.209 --> 02:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
grew up in a low-income household my dad
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
was a pow and a fully disabled veteran I
 
02:14:01.729 --> 02:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
lived in public housing and attended
 
02:14:03.890 --> 02:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
Public Schools so I'm a strong advocate
 
02:14:05.390 --> 02:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
for public schools and consider
 
02:14:07.450 --> 02:14:07.460 align:start position:0%
education provided critical to the sex
 
02:14:11.569 --> 02:14:11.579 align:start position:0%
success of the students our state in in
 
02:14:14.169 --> 02:14:14.179 align:start position:0%
the entire nation in fact
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
my public education public school
 
02:14:18.050 --> 02:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
education got me a scholarship to
 
02:14:19.609 --> 02:14:19.619 align:start position:0%
Northeastern University where I
 
02:14:21.890 --> 02:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
graduated with honors and after military
 
02:14:24.050 --> 02:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
service I completed a master's degree at
 
02:14:25.550 --> 02:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
Babson College
 
02:14:27.770 --> 02:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh for the past 20 years I've been a
 
02:14:29.450 --> 02:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
trustee for the Mayhew program I hope
 
02:14:31.069 --> 02:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
you've heard of Mayhew it's an important
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
non-profit we serve disadvantaged youth
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the state ours is actually a boys
 
02:14:37.490 --> 02:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
program I'm now the treasurer of the
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
Mayhew program so I work on a daily
 
02:14:41.870 --> 02:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
basis on Youth Development in the state
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
the people of Hebron are aware of this
 
02:14:47.089 --> 02:14:47.099 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation and are in favor
 
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
the people of Bridgewater and Hebron
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
paid for the school and maintain it on
 
02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
an annual basis and we have great pride
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
in the school it's important part of the
 
02:14:57.890 --> 02:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
community I'll stop for a second because
 
02:14:59.649 --> 02:14:59.659 align:start position:0%
you mentioned Groton and I want to say
 
02:15:02.689 --> 02:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
Groton children as you heard
 
02:15:06.050 --> 02:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
attend our school K-5 now they don't
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
participate in the funding and we don't
 
02:15:10.189 --> 02:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
ask them to for any funding and I'll
 
02:15:12.169 --> 02:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
just tell you we would never leave out
 
02:15:14.330 --> 02:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
the children abroad they will always be
 
02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
included we share ambulance and fire
 
02:15:19.729 --> 02:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
service with Groton on a Cooperative
 
02:15:21.410 --> 02:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
basis I mean there are neighbors are
 
02:15:23.209 --> 02:15:23.219 align:start position:0%
friends and they are part of the
 
02:15:25.069 --> 02:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
equation here
 
02:15:25.079 --> 02:15:26.510 align:start position:0%
equation here
um

02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:28.189 --> 02:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
the school is an important part of the
 
02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
community as I said it's also our
 
02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
emergency shelter I think which should
 
02:15:34.250 --> 02:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
be mentioned are police protected our
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
police do the safety checks they run the
 
02:15:39.050 --> 02:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
bike safety program we provide these
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
services along with the athletic appeals
 
02:15:44.330 --> 02:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
without any outside financial support
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
the townspeople understand this proposal
 
02:15:48.530 --> 02:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
to establish our own school district and
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
reconfigure the K-8 will require
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
additional costs this question has been
 
02:15:54.109 --> 02:15:54.119 align:start position:0%
asked a couple of times what we've told
 
02:15:56.089 --> 02:15:56.099 align:start position:0%
our citizens is it will probably cost
 
02:15:58.370 --> 02:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
more money but they still support it and
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
I think it will be important for
 
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.430 align:start position:0%
I think it will be important for
education

02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
we're fully intend to form a Cooperative
 
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
relationship with sau4 for high school
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
sports and activities
 
02:16:11.209 --> 02:16:11.219 align:start position:0%
our only goal is to improve public
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
education for the children in more local
 
02:16:13.199 --> 02:16:14.390 align:start position:0%
education for the children in more local
control

02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
control
 
02:16:16.370 --> 02:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
I want to comment and I heard what the
 
02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
superintendent said he came and spoke to
 
02:16:21.050 --> 02:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
our select wood and I have great respect
 
02:16:23.569 --> 02:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
for everything they do at the SAU but
 
02:16:25.550 --> 02:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
our SAU is
 
02:16:28.189 --> 02:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
almost 300 square miles I believe it's
 
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
the second largest in the state
 
02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:31.810 align:start position:0%
the second largest in the state
um

02:16:31.810 --> 02:16:31.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:34.969 --> 02:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
and seven towns it's very difficult to
 
02:16:36.349 --> 02:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
manage I think as you heard the
 
02:16:38.030 --> 02:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent say to move the children
 
02:16:41.870 --> 02:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
and balance classrooms and size and age
 
02:16:44.330 --> 02:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult for them I think
 
02:16:45.650 --> 02:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
this would
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
help him do that The Far Side of Groton
 
02:16:50.810 --> 02:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
measure her it is more than an hour's
 
02:16:52.490 --> 02:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
drive from the other schools in our
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
district our three towns are North
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
on the North End we border more Plymouth
 
02:17:00.650 --> 02:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
Dorchester Romney if you're familiar
 
02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
with central New Hampshire then Bristol
 
02:17:05.929 --> 02:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
and I bring up the example of Route 104
 
02:17:08.929 --> 02:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
which runs from Danbury
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
to Meredith actually and passes through
 
02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
virtually right through the other four
 
02:17:16.310 --> 02:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
towns in the district so it's a state
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
road maintained all the other schools
 
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
actually sit on 104. and so the ability
 
02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
to move students as the superintendent
 
02:17:27.049 --> 02:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
said and they have a study group and
 
02:17:28.910 --> 02:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
their approach which he told us is
 
02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
probably to consolidate an elementary
 
02:17:31.620 --> 02:17:32.750 align:start position:0%
probably to consolidate an elementary
school

02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere convenient in the district and
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
I just look at the geography for a
 
02:17:39.469 --> 02:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
minute and think that that 104 Corridor
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
is a perfect perfect place for that but
 
02:17:44.209 --> 02:17:44.219 align:start position:0%
we lay to the north of that and Groton
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
farther to the north so I think that
 
02:17:49.610 --> 02:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
this proposal will actually work well to
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
to make it stronger and better and less
 
02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:54.110 align:start position:0%
to make it stronger and better and less
expensive

02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
02:17:55.969 --> 02:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
um I just want to finally say our goal
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
is to improve educational outcomes for
 
02:17:59.690 --> 02:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
the children the bill allows for greater
 
02:18:02.330 --> 02:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
local forces and quality and establish
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
the three-town school district and
 
02:18:06.410 --> 02:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
reconfigure the K to Aid allows parents
 
02:18:08.030 --> 02:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
a choice between a traditional middle
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
school and a K-8 program I hope you're
 
02:18:12.650 --> 02:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
in favor I just want to say one thing
 
02:18:14.929 --> 02:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
when you heard about the distance the
 
02:18:17.089 --> 02:18:17.099 align:start position:0%
students have to travel I have to think
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
about the parents who have to care for
 
02:18:22.129 --> 02:18:22.139 align:start position:0%
the kids after 2 30 after three o'clock
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
and the school is an hour away that's
 
02:18:27.410 --> 02:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
one way so two hour ride to provide for
 
02:18:29.690 --> 02:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
students or daycare or take care of them
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
after school hours is is difficult in
 
02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
our area so thank you for listening
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions
 
02:18:40.310 --> 02:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner thank you I'm I'm thank
 
02:18:41.690 --> 02:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm still
 
02:18:44.330 --> 02:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
kind of confused about the funding do
 
02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:18:47.929 --> 02:18:47.939 align:start position:0%
a separate funding
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
within the Bridgewater
 
02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:51.650 align:start position:0%
within the Bridgewater
um

02:18:51.650 --> 02:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:54.889 --> 02:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
Hebron district is there a separate tax
 
02:18:57.530 --> 02:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
for that particular school and an
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
additional tax that you pay to the
 
02:19:01.610 --> 02:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
Newfound Cooperative district is that
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
what's happening yes correct and and
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
how's that going to change
 
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
well we'll be funding
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
one school rather than contributing to a
 
02:19:13.969 --> 02:19:13.979 align:start position:0%
district we'd continue to maintain the
 
02:19:13.979 --> 02:19:15.169 align:start position:0%
district we'd continue to maintain the
school

02:19:15.169 --> 02:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:19:17.929 --> 02:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
I think but with them we'd have to
 
02:19:21.169 --> 02:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
find access for high school and we
 
02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
assume we'd pay tuition to the high
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
school some may prefer Plymouth to the
 
02:19:27.290 --> 02:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
north all the Plymouth School District I
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
should add is K to eight and each town
 
02:19:33.349 --> 02:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
has their own school board so as you go
 
02:19:34.969 --> 02:19:34.979 align:start position:0%
further north I think and the area
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
becomes more Rural and travel is
 
02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
difficult I just want to point out the
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
district next to us in Plymouth already
 
02:19:43.250 --> 02:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
operates on a K-8 model so we would
 
02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
tuition students I mean our approach
 
02:19:47.209 --> 02:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
from the select board in the town is to
 
02:19:50.330 --> 02:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
work as cooperatively with sau4 as we
 
02:19:52.270 --> 02:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
possibly can
 
02:19:56.210 --> 02:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
go ahead so on Transportation do you pay
 
02:19:58.010 --> 02:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
for the transportation or does the
 
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District Newfound have the
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
contract with the buses currently they
 
02:20:04.250 --> 02:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
pay for it okay thank you but you think
 
02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
we're the furthest ones out so we're
 
02:20:08.450 --> 02:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
probably the highest cost the other
 
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
towns lay conveniently I think right
 
02:20:13.130 --> 02:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
along 104 and I think their ability to
 
02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
move children would would be a big
 
02:20:15.540 --> 02:20:17.630 align:start position:0%
move children would would be a big
advantage

02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Damon
 
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have two unrelated
 
02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:24.830 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have two unrelated
questions

02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
I believe you said you were on the 2014
 
02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
study committee for a similar endeavor
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
yeah if that's correct similar is okay
 
02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
word yeah could you reflect on what is
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
different now from then that brings
 
02:20:43.969 --> 02:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
something similar back before the
 
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
townspeople and before us
 
02:20:49.130 --> 02:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
um well that was unsuccessful we'd like
 
02:20:51.410 --> 02:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
to be successful we still would like to
 
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
have the
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
we'd like to have the K-8 model I mean I
 
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
was on the committee
 
02:20:59.450 --> 02:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
I learned a lot
 
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
I think it was flawed in some ways the
 
02:21:06.130 --> 02:21:06.140 align:start position:0%
the SAU wasn't cooperative
 
02:21:09.650 --> 02:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
we tried to for example negotiate on a
 
02:21:12.410 --> 02:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
price for tuition in and out and they
 
02:21:14.210 --> 02:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
told us they would not
 
02:21:16.490 --> 02:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
speaking honestly here and Pierre was
 
02:21:17.929 --> 02:21:17.939 align:start position:0%
not part of it
 
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
um they would not discuss tuition in
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
high school students
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
at that same time they were in
 
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
negotiation with Hill and completed a
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
negotiation to bring the who Hill
 
02:21:32.270 --> 02:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
students into their High School
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
so I I felt that was disingenuous to be
 
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
honest because they said no we don't
 
02:21:38.570 --> 02:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
we're not going to talk about tuition at
 
02:21:40.010 --> 02:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
the same time they were holding meetings
 
02:21:42.650 --> 02:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
with Hill and they have since moved the
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
hill students into the high school so we
 
02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
were unsuccessful
 
02:21:49.370 --> 02:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
as I said we tried the process
 
02:21:51.170 --> 02:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
that was a failure I think if we tried
 
02:21:54.050 --> 02:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
it again we'd probably be unsuccessful
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
the Voting is balanced against us
 
02:21:58.849 --> 02:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
there's four towns maybe on one side and
 
02:22:00.410 --> 02:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
three towns and the other Groton did not
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
participate in the prior a 2014 study so
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
we basically railroaded
 
02:22:10.969 --> 02:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions
 
02:22:14.090 --> 02:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
I had another one go ahead thank you
 
02:22:14.100 --> 02:22:14.990 align:start position:0%
I had another one go ahead thank you
um

02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:16.370 --> 02:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
break cramp now I can't remember what
 
02:22:18.290 --> 02:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
the other one was oh
 
02:22:21.170 --> 02:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
has this current effort
 
02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
talked with Plymouth about their
 
02:22:26.809 --> 02:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
receptiveness to tuition students I have
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
not participated in that I did in 2014
 
02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
and they were receptive
 
02:22:33.469 --> 02:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
they also as the kids get older whatever
 
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
they have excess capacity as you heard
 
02:22:37.610 --> 02:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
the superintendent says he has excess
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
capacity in his high school so and I
 
02:22:43.070 --> 02:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
know the hill students got a have a what
 
02:22:45.290 --> 02:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
I would consider a favorable
 
02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
favorable tuition rate into Newfound
 
02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
they pay less per student than we do as
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
a town for example so I think Plymouth
 
02:22:54.349 --> 02:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
would be receptive to it and for Groton
 
02:22:56.210 --> 02:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
students and maybe Hebron were on the
 
02:22:58.610 --> 02:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
North side that would be really
 
02:23:01.250 --> 02:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
important to students and parents
 
02:23:04.190 --> 02:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
thanks very much any further questions
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much all right thank you
 
02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
is represent Carol Brown here
 
02:23:13.130 --> 02:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:17.690 --> 02:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
let's see it is here thank you to ours
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
and two L's like Archie Bunker Carol
 
02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:27.130 align:start position:0%
and two L's like Archie Bunker Carol
O'Connor

02:23:27.130 --> 02:23:27.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative Carol Brown Graft in
 
02:23:31.730 --> 02:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
District 10 so I have Bristol and
 
02:23:33.490 --> 02:23:33.500 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater in my District
 
02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative sellers is also here in
 
02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
the back who also has a number of these
 
02:23:41.090 --> 02:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
talents and more of his towns uh in his
 
02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:43.490 align:start position:0%
talents and more of his towns uh in his
district

02:23:43.490 --> 02:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:46.610 --> 02:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh I hadn't prepared any statement and I
 
02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
thought it would be worth my bringing
 
02:23:51.050 --> 02:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
your attention to something I think is
 
02:23:53.690 --> 02:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
part of this conversation
 
02:23:55.969 --> 02:23:55.979 align:start position:0%
and for those constituents behind me who
 
02:23:59.090 --> 02:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
who wish I weren't saying this please
 
02:24:01.370 --> 02:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
talk to me later
 
02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:03.830 align:start position:0%
talk to me later
um

02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:07.250 --> 02:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
I am this is I'm not speaking for or
 
02:24:09.650 --> 02:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
against this I'm hoping to provide you
 
02:24:12.770 --> 02:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
just a little bit more information
 
02:24:14.210 --> 02:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm not disputing anything that's
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
been said there's been a lot of great
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
things said it's it's it's compelling
 
02:24:21.770 --> 02:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
testimony from the people behind me to
 
02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
move ahead with us
 
02:24:25.250 --> 02:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not disputing that in any
 
02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:26.030 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not disputing that in any
way

02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:24:27.410 --> 02:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
one of the things I think that is
 
02:24:28.370 --> 02:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
important for the committee to
 
02:24:30.770 --> 02:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
understand here from completeness
 
02:24:34.969 --> 02:24:34.979 align:start position:0%
is and this may go to your question I'm
 
02:24:37.010 --> 02:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
sure someone behind me could
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
correct it or dispute it there has been
 
02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
an ongoing conversation in the school
 
02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
district about changing the funding
 
02:24:47.690 --> 02:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
formula for the district
 
02:24:50.570 --> 02:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
it has been extremely contentious
 
02:24:54.050 --> 02:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
it's been going on for a number of years
 
02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:55.610 align:start position:0%
it's been going on for a number of years
in

02:24:55.610 --> 02:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:24:58.190 --> 02:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
the past year there was a committee
 
02:25:00.650 --> 02:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
formed with representatives from each of
 
02:25:02.990 --> 02:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
the towns to have a conversation about
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
this funding formula in the district
 
02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
um it was so it was contentious enough
 
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
to the point where there was yelling and
 
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
swearing at a number of these meetings
 
02:25:15.230 --> 02:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
or at least one
 
02:25:18.410 --> 02:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a big issue
 
02:25:20.690 --> 02:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
there are those that believe the funding
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
formulas will be changed and and I will
 
02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:25.730 align:start position:0%
formulas will be changed and and I will
I

02:25:25.730 --> 02:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:25:25.740 --> 02:25:27.590 align:start position:0%
I
I will

02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
I will
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
um ask if anyone else in behind me has
 
02:25:32.170 --> 02:25:32.180 align:start position:0%
they have much more specific information
 
02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
if the funding formula there are those
 
02:25:36.830 --> 02:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
who believe the funding formula should
 
02:25:38.450 --> 02:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
be changed
 
02:25:41.570 --> 02:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
to include more property valuation and
 
02:25:43.370 --> 02:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple explanation of
 
02:25:46.670 --> 02:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
this if that were to occur the towns are
 
02:25:49.309 --> 02:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater and Hebron and Groton who
 
02:25:51.770 --> 02:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
would pay a significantly larger amount
 
02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
into the school district than they are
 
02:25:53.399 --> 02:25:54.469 align:start position:0%
into the school district than they are
now

02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:25:56.410 --> 02:25:56.420 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a little
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
disappointed that no one has said that I
 
02:26:00.530 --> 02:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
don't again I do not dispute anything
 
02:26:02.809 --> 02:26:02.819 align:start position:0%
that's been said to this point I think
 
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
for completeness for you all to know
 
02:26:07.309 --> 02:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
that that is a piece of this if you go
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
downtown uh if you go downtown in
 
02:26:10.370 --> 02:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
Bristol have a cup of coffee and we talk
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
about this topic there's no question
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
that that piece of the funding is going
 
02:26:15.950 --> 02:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
to come up that this is part of the
 
02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:17.090 align:start position:0%
to come up that this is part of the
conversation

02:26:17.090 --> 02:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
so I that's
 
02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
um and for those behind me again I have
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
a number of people I know back here and
 
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
a number of constituents that I don't
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
know back here and I'm sure I will have
 
02:26:28.429 --> 02:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
to the end of this meeting and that
 
02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
would be great
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I thought it was important to bring
 
02:26:33.950 --> 02:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
that little piece to your attention that
 
02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
you did hear the superintendent if you
 
02:26:37.550 --> 02:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
caught it he did say that there was some
 
02:26:40.010 --> 02:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
funding discussions and at this point
 
02:26:42.530 --> 02:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
there was no plan to change that funding
 
02:26:42.540 --> 02:26:44.270 align:start position:0%
there was no plan to change that funding
mechanism

02:26:44.270 --> 02:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
02:26:47.090 --> 02:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
um uh and that was due to this
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
commission this committee that was
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
formed over the past year they sent out
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
a report that said this is what we
 
02:26:55.010 --> 02:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
discovered and there was no decision to
 
02:26:58.490 --> 02:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
make a change to that so I it's um I
 
02:27:00.170 --> 02:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
probably can't answer specific questions
 
02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
about the funding but I thought it was
 
02:27:03.410 --> 02:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
an important piece of this puzzle for
 
02:27:05.389 --> 02:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
you all to know so thank you thank you
 
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
very much representative Brown
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
um represent cardelli uh thank you Mr
 
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you representative for
 
02:27:13.610 --> 02:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
being here
 
02:27:16.730 --> 02:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
um uh in terms of the funding formula
 
02:27:19.250 --> 02:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
and the area agreement
 
02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:20.330 align:start position:0%
and the area agreement
um

02:27:20.330 --> 02:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:22.610 --> 02:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
um the articles of green I mean
 
02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that some
 
02:27:27.969 --> 02:27:27.979 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement for some co-ops
 
02:27:30.349 --> 02:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
include a provision so that if the
 
02:27:32.750 --> 02:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
funding is formula and funding formula
 
02:27:37.969 --> 02:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
has changed it allows towns to withdraw
 
02:27:38.990 --> 02:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
um do you know if there's anything
 
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
provision like that in
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
um this SAU or articles of agreement no
 
02:27:47.690 --> 02:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I'm sure that uh the
 
02:27:49.250 --> 02:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
select board member Murphy and or the
 
02:27:50.510 --> 02:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent have that answer about
 
02:27:52.010 --> 02:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
the tip of their tongue but I don't know
 
02:27:53.809 --> 02:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
that personally thank you
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.230 align:start position:0%

02:28:40.429 --> 02:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
for 25 years in the new found Area

02:28:43.969 --> 02:28:43.979 align:start position:0%
I'm a Hebron resident and my son
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
attended the Bridgewater Hebron Village
 
02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:47.270 align:start position:0%
attended the Bridgewater Hebron Village
School

02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
School
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to talk
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
about children and families
 
02:28:56.090 --> 02:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
in my years in the classroom I've seen
 
02:28:59.150 --> 02:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
tremendous changes in children families
 
02:29:00.770 --> 02:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
and Society
 
02:29:02.809 --> 02:29:02.819 align:start position:0%
the impact that comes from those changes
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
has affected our children in ways that
 
02:29:06.889 --> 02:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
are sometimes visible
 
02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
and sometimes not
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
even prior to the pandemic our children
 
02:29:13.250 --> 02:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
were struggling
 
02:29:18.670 --> 02:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
the CDC reports from 2016 to 2020
 
02:29:21.469 --> 02:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
5.8 million students were diagnosed with
 
02:29:25.010 --> 02:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
anxiety and 2.7 million were diagnosed
 
02:29:26.570 --> 02:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
with depression
 
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
research suggests that the K-8 model
 
02:29:32.270 --> 02:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
helps to combat those struggles our
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
children face
 
02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
message of this bill is critical to our
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
vision for our students
 
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
think back
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
acne awkwardness hormones
 
02:29:50.090 --> 02:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
sixth graders are vulnerable
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
switching schools at sixth grade
 
02:29:56.210 --> 02:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
increases Stress and Anxiety
 
02:29:59.210 --> 02:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
having served on transition teams from
 
02:30:01.130 --> 02:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
fifth to sixth grade I can assure you
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
there are students who believe older
 
02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
students will stuff them in lockers
 
02:30:10.610 --> 02:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
it's a reality our children face
 
02:30:14.770 --> 02:30:14.780 align:start position:0%
the K-8 model offers no such transition
 
02:30:18.110 --> 02:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
instead children remain in a nurturing
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
familiar environment where they can
 
02:30:23.809 --> 02:30:23.819 align:start position:0%
continue to grow both academically and
 
02:30:23.819 --> 02:30:26.170 align:start position:0%
continue to grow both academically and
socially

02:30:26.170 --> 02:30:26.180 align:start position:0%
socially
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
warranted or not
 
02:30:30.410 --> 02:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
Middle School does not have a great
 
02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:31.730 align:start position:0%
Middle School does not have a great
reputation

02:30:31.730 --> 02:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
reputation
 
02:30:34.370 --> 02:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
and it's often a reputation that keeps
 
02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
parents away
 
02:30:38.570 --> 02:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
parents are important to their
 
02:30:40.429 --> 02:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
children's education
 
02:30:43.370 --> 02:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
Purdue University rights when parents
 
02:30:45.469 --> 02:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
are involved students get better grades
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
and score higher on standardized tests
 
02:30:51.050 --> 02:30:51.060 align:start position:0%
what's more children of involved parents
 
02:30:53.630 --> 02:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
have better attendance records drop out
 
02:30:57.050 --> 02:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
less often have higher aspirations and
 
02:30:59.929 --> 02:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
more positive attitudes toward school
 
02:31:02.630 --> 02:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
and homework
 
02:31:05.570 --> 02:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
fewer transitions for students and
 
02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
continued parental involvement indicate
 
02:31:10.730 --> 02:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
to me that the K-8 model is good for our
 
02:31:14.210 --> 02:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
children and our families
 
02:31:16.670 --> 02:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
that same familiar nurturing environment
 
02:31:19.550 --> 02:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
that supports our students supports our
 
02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:20.750 align:start position:0%
that supports our students supports our
families

02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
the Bridgewater Hebron school has a
 
02:31:25.370 --> 02:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
20-year history of providing strong
 
02:31:28.190 --> 02:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities for students
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
and strong parental Community
 
02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:31.849 align:start position:0%
and strong parental Community
involvement

involvement
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill 349 grants us the opportunity
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
to continue that tradition for our
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
community and our families through
 
02:31:40.190 --> 02:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
eighth grade
 
02:31:41.929 --> 02:31:41.939 align:start position:0%
I ask that you help us guide our
 
02:31:44.330 --> 02:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
students by supporting this Bill thank
 
02:31:47.809 --> 02:31:47.819 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much other questions
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
accordion I thank you for taking my
 
02:31:51.359 --> 02:31:52.610 align:start position:0%
accordion I thank you for taking my
question

02:31:52.610 --> 02:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:31:54.290 --> 02:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
um everyone keeps referring to this K to
 
02:31:56.809 --> 02:31:56.819 align:start position:0%
eight model and it sounds like you've
 
02:31:59.170 --> 02:31:59.180 align:start position:0%
done a bit of research
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh I uh I know that Catholic schools
 
02:32:04.610 --> 02:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
have predominantly followed that model
 
02:32:06.770 --> 02:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
so I wonder if in your research you have
 
02:32:09.050 --> 02:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
read anything about that and the
 
02:32:12.650 --> 02:32:12.660 align:start position:0%
benefits uh you know the benefits from
 
02:32:15.050 --> 02:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
that because if you know that is their
 
02:32:17.389 --> 02:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
structure but I did not come across any
 
02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
of that in my research
 
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:32:24.770 --> 02:32:24.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:32:46.730 --> 02:32:46.740 align:start position:0%

for or an opinion on whether HB 349
 
02:33:52.670 --> 02:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
constitutes a lawful Act of the
 
02:33:55.309 --> 02:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
legislature and I've been asked by the
 
02:33:57.250 --> 02:33:57.260 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who have spoken here today
 
02:34:00.770 --> 02:34:00.780 align:start position:0%

02:34:03.170 --> 02:34:03.180 align:start position:0%

okay and I have 20 copies of the legal

to the members after this hearing I'm
 
02:34:16.730 --> 02:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
not an attorney so if you have questions
 
02:34:20.210 --> 02:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to collect them and ask the
 
02:34:22.849 --> 02:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
legal advisor to provide written answers
 
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
and this is from the Wadley star and
 
02:34:28.190 --> 02:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
Peter's Law Firm in
 
02:34:32.330 --> 02:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester Dear Mr Murphy you asked us
 
02:34:35.450 --> 02:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
to review House Bill 349 and act
 
02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:37.140 align:start position:0%
relative to special purpose school
 
02:34:38.929 --> 02:34:38.939 align:start position:0%
district for Bridgewater Hebron in
 
02:34:41.570 --> 02:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
Groton and in particular you have asked
 
02:34:44.809 --> 02:34:44.819 align:start position:0%
us to opine whether the bill constitutes
 
02:34:47.929 --> 02:34:47.939 align:start position:0%
a lawful Act of the legislature
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
in our opinion the answer is yes and we
 
02:34:52.910 --> 02:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
reach that opinion for the following
 
02:34:55.309 --> 02:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
reasons number one
 
02:34:57.889 --> 02:34:57.899 align:start position:0%
the legislature retains the authority
 
02:35:00.650 --> 02:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
over the formulation of public school
 
02:35:00.660 --> 02:35:02.150 align:start position:0%
over the formulation of public school
districts

02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a not a home rule state
 
02:35:09.469 --> 02:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
moreover while school districts are a
 
02:35:12.230 --> 02:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
separate corporate entity they serve as
 
02:35:14.270 --> 02:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
a subdivision of the state
 
02:35:16.670 --> 02:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
as a result the legislature has
 
02:35:18.830 --> 02:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
exercised its authority over the span of
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
its history to create school districts
 
02:35:24.889 --> 02:35:24.899 align:start position:0%
through enabling legislation
 
02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the past 30 years the legislature has
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
self-regulated that authority to create
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
and establish school districts by
 
02:35:36.170 --> 02:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
voluntarily subordinating its authority
 
02:35:38.450 --> 02:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
to local control
 
02:35:41.210 --> 02:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
in other words the legislature has
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
passed enabling legislation
 
02:35:46.570 --> 02:35:46.580 align:start position:0%
but has made the adoption of such such
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
subject to the will of the citizens in
 
02:35:50.929 --> 02:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
the local towns
 
02:35:53.809 --> 02:35:53.819 align:start position:0%
cities or school districts
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
for example recently the legislature
 
02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
adopted a bill with regard to the
 
02:36:02.650 --> 02:36:02.660 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
authorizing certain Charter amendments
 
02:36:07.490 --> 02:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
and the establishment of further
 
02:36:09.170 --> 02:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
Independence on the part of the school
 
02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
district however that legislation was
 
02:36:16.849 --> 02:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
contingent upon adoption by the local
 
02:36:19.010 --> 02:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
02:36:22.730 --> 02:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
this bill follows that model and if
 
02:36:25.130 --> 02:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
passed is a lawful exercise of the
 
02:36:26.990 --> 02:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
general Court's legislative Authority
 
02:36:30.110 --> 02:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
but with due deference to the local
 
02:36:32.210 --> 02:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
decision of the voters
 
02:36:33.770 --> 02:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
number two
 
02:36:37.070 --> 02:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
the bill repairs a unique flaw in The
 
02:36:39.650 --> 02:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
Cooperative withdrawal statutes
 
02:36:42.410 --> 02:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
in this case the Bridgewater Hebron
 
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
Village District owns the school
 
02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
attended by the students in the
 
02:36:49.849 --> 02:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater Hebron Groton area
 
02:36:53.090 --> 02:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
this is a truly unique fact which
 
02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
deviates substantially from the norm
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
the adoption of this bill provides a
 
02:37:01.309 --> 02:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
pathway for the Bridgewater Hebron
 
02:37:04.429 --> 02:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
Groton towns to normalize the
 
02:37:06.429 --> 02:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
relationship with the village district
 
02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
and create their own District which more
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
aligns with the fact that the ownership
 
02:37:14.929 --> 02:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
of the building in which the children
 
02:37:18.590 --> 02:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
are educated reposes within the local
 
02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:20.270 align:start position:0%
are educated reposes within the local
community

02:37:20.270 --> 02:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:37:22.429 --> 02:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
the general court is well aware of the
 
02:37:24.290 --> 02:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
challenges presented by the withdrawal
 
02:37:25.790 --> 02:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
provisions of a Cooperative school
 
02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:26.870 align:start position:0%
provisions of a Cooperative school
districts

02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:37:29.330 --> 02:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
while one can argue on either side of
 
02:37:31.730 --> 02:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
the issue in regard to the correct
 
02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
manner in which to approach withdrawal
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
on these facts there is little or no
 
02:37:40.130 --> 02:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
doubt that the local Act of the
 
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
legislature will provide an opportunity
 
02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
to cure a model which deviates from the
 
02:37:47.700 --> 02:37:48.710 align:start position:0%
to cure a model which deviates from the
norm

02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
norm
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
number three as a local act this bill
 
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
does not modify the general Provisions
 
02:37:57.469 --> 02:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
pertaining to other Cooperative school
 
02:37:57.479 --> 02:37:58.610 align:start position:0%
pertaining to other Cooperative school
districts

02:37:58.610 --> 02:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:38:01.130 --> 02:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
at first blush there may be reluctance
 
02:38:03.050 --> 02:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
on the part of some to adopt this bill
 
02:38:05.270 --> 02:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that it creates a more
 
02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
nuanced withdrawal process however this
 
02:38:11.690 --> 02:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
bill applies to a local situation where
 
02:38:14.270 --> 02:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
a separate municipality owns the
 
02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
building in which the children are
 
02:38:19.510 --> 02:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
educated it is not capable of repetition
 
02:38:23.330 --> 02:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
and represents a truly unique set of
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
facts for the reason set forth above it
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
is our opinion that this local
 
02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
legislation is consistent with the
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
legislators Authority very truly yours
 
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:37.200 align:start position:0%

good not a lawyer well just pass it
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:57.290 --> 02:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

02:40:33.050 --> 02:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
1975 and my daughter graduated from the
 
02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
Regional District High School
 
02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
in the late 1990s I was elected to serve
 
02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
as a member of the Bridgewater Board of
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
Selectmen that worked to create gain
 
02:40:46.010 --> 02:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
approval and fund the Hebron Bridgewater
 
02:40:49.010 --> 02:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
Village School District so I was in at
 
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
the at the ground floor of the uh of
 
02:40:53.270 --> 02:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
this effort
 
02:40:56.570 --> 02:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
my support of HB 349 stems from my
 
02:40:59.389 --> 02:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
experience as a parent and educator a
 
02:41:01.610 --> 02:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
selectman and most recently as a town
 
02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:03.410 align:start position:0%
selectman and most recently as a town
moderator

02:41:03.410 --> 02:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
02:41:05.809 --> 02:41:05.819 align:start position:0%
as an education professional I became
 
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
aware of a number of difficulties
 
02:41:10.010 --> 02:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
confronting children throughout the
 
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
state the first of the challenges
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
involved in unreasonably lengthy
 
02:41:16.010 --> 02:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
commutes that came to be measured in
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
hours spent by children in school buses
 
02:41:22.370 --> 02:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
many of the behavioral problems we
 
02:41:26.270 --> 02:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
frankly learned we had their initiative
 
02:41:30.349 --> 02:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
or started on buses that's a part of the
 
02:41:30.359 --> 02:41:30.889 align:start position:0%
or started on buses that's a part of the
um

02:41:30.889 --> 02:41:30.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:33.650 --> 02:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
children's lives it's unmonitored and
 
02:41:36.110 --> 02:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes open season for the younger
 
02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:37.370 align:start position:0%
sometimes open season for the younger
kids

02:41:37.370 --> 02:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
kids
 
02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
additionally as a parent from a
 
02:41:41.210 --> 02:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
developmental standpoint I was concerned
 
02:41:43.250 --> 02:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
about exposing Elementary age children
 
02:41:45.830 --> 02:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
to troubling teenage social and
 
02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
behavioral patterns the sort of burdens
 
02:41:50.690 --> 02:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
and dynamics that the youngsters are
 
02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
ill-prepared to handle the mix there the
 
02:41:55.610 --> 02:41:55.620 align:start position:0%
difference between a sixth grader and a
 
02:41:58.969 --> 02:41:58.979 align:start position:0%
ninth grader is enormous developmentally
 
02:42:01.969 --> 02:42:01.979 align:start position:0%
the younger kids don't have the impulse
 
02:42:05.950 --> 02:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
control don't have the capacity to
 
02:42:09.110 --> 02:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
resist temptation think out the
 
02:42:11.870 --> 02:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
consequences of behaviors and a lot of
 
02:42:14.210 --> 02:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
those kids at that age end up heading
 
02:42:17.510 --> 02:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the rocks and never getting off them
 
02:42:20.510 --> 02:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
when I wrote the town history oh finally
 
02:42:22.190 --> 02:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
as an elected official I've heard
 
02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
repeated expressions of frustration on
 
02:42:27.410 --> 02:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
the part of citizens who felt a lack of
 
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
connection with far-flung school
 
02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:30.950 align:start position:0%
connection with far-flung school
districts

02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
when I wrote the town history of
 
02:42:35.809 --> 02:42:35.819 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater in 1987 Old-Timers spoke
 
02:42:37.610 --> 02:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
with a deep sense of loss that occurred
 
02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
when local children were removed from
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
the town
 
02:42:44.090 --> 02:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
a general sense of loss of control of
 
02:42:46.309 --> 02:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
the schools on the part of the small
 
02:42:49.490 --> 02:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
towns that are de facto outvoted by the
 
02:42:51.710 --> 02:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
large towns is
 
02:42:53.690 --> 02:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
um is a source of a lot of frustration
 
02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:55.490 align:start position:0%
um is a source of a lot of frustration
was

02:42:55.490 --> 02:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:42:58.190 --> 02:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
in my estimation of basic duty of rural
 
02:43:00.170 --> 02:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
education is to assure that the
 
02:43:02.690 --> 02:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
legitimate organizational needs of Lodge
 
02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
districts do not override the core
 
02:43:07.849 --> 02:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
mission of providing a nurturing love of
 
02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
learning in children at the local human
 
02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:11.530 align:start position:0%
learning in children at the local human
level

02:43:11.530 --> 02:43:11.540 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:43:14.330 --> 02:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
it was for that reason including the
 
02:43:16.130 --> 02:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
prospect of increased volunteer
 
02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
involvement in the local school district
 
02:43:20.450 --> 02:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
that we put forth the effort to create
 
02:43:22.969 --> 02:43:22.979 align:start position:0%
the Hebron Bridgewater Village District
 
02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
more than two decades ago
 
02:43:29.150 --> 02:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
the results in the ensuing years I
 
02:43:30.770 --> 02:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
believe have proven out the hope for
 
02:43:32.990 --> 02:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
strengths of this logical and local
 
02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:34.730 align:start position:0%
strengths of this logical and local
approach

02:43:34.730 --> 02:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
approach
 
02:43:37.010 --> 02:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
children parents and Educators have
 
02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
consistently expressed their
 
02:43:40.849 --> 02:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
satisfaction and their pride in this
 
02:43:43.250 --> 02:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
model and test scores have worn this out
 
02:43:44.929 --> 02:43:44.939 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
02:43:47.570 --> 02:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
focusing developmentally on the needs of
 
02:43:49.730 --> 02:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
younger children is a major strength of
 
02:43:52.730 --> 02:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
the K through a calimentary model
 
02:43:55.450 --> 02:43:55.460 align:start position:0%
The Village district is a sensible
 
02:43:57.830 --> 02:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
tradition-based innovation
 
02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
that we feel has amplearned the support
 
02:44:02.690 --> 02:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
of this enabling legislation
 
02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration thank
 
02:44:07.130 --> 02:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
you very much other questions
 
02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
represent Damon yeah
 
02:44:11.450 --> 02:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:44:13.370 --> 02:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:44:16.370 --> 02:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
I think you've answered a question that
 
02:44:18.889 --> 02:44:18.899 align:start position:0%
I've been thinking through here it's not
 
02:44:21.410 --> 02:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
that there would be fewer transitions
 
02:44:23.570 --> 02:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
for the students but that the timing of
 
02:44:24.889 --> 02:44:24.899 align:start position:0%
the transition would be more
 
02:44:26.690 --> 02:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
developmentally appropriate that's right
 
02:44:28.370 --> 02:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
correct that's right and the
 
02:44:30.770 --> 02:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
surroundings would be familiar
 
02:44:33.050 --> 02:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
they're going through so many hormonal
 
02:44:35.870 --> 02:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
changes anyway having the same physical
 
02:44:39.170 --> 02:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
space and the same human connections of
 
02:44:42.050 --> 02:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
the counseling role of a teacher is
 
02:44:44.050 --> 02:44:44.060 align:start position:0%
really important
 
02:44:44.060 --> 02:44:46.010 align:start position:0%
really important

thank you very much thank you all
 
02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
for the committee we have about 14 more
 
02:44:56.750 --> 02:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
minutes of testimony and then we've done
 
02:44:58.730 --> 02:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
these cards so we can wrap that up right
 
02:45:02.090 --> 02:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
now uh Eric Piper

02:45:14.210 --> 02:45:14.220 align:start position:0%
my name is Eric Piper and I'm the
 
02:45:15.950 --> 02:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
elected budget committee representative
 
02:45:18.830 --> 02:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
from Bridgewater for the sau4 I've
 
02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
completed four budget Cycles uh on the
 
02:45:24.290 --> 02:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
committee I have two years remaining on
 
02:45:26.750 --> 02:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
my current term in my professional life
 
02:45:29.570 --> 02:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
I have a master's in finance and I've
 
02:45:31.730 --> 02:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
spent the last 30 years in budgeting and
 
02:45:34.010 --> 02:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
profit Center management for Fortune 500
 
02:45:34.020 --> 02:45:35.450 align:start position:0%
profit Center management for Fortune 500
companies

02:45:35.450 --> 02:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
companies
 
02:45:37.730 --> 02:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
I support this bill because I believe it
 
02:45:39.290 --> 02:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
brings some Innovative educational
 
02:45:42.410 --> 02:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
options to the entire Newfound area and
 
02:45:44.690 --> 02:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
it can do so in a real cost effective
 
02:45:44.700 --> 02:45:46.550 align:start position:0%
it can do so in a real cost effective
manner

02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
manner
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
considering the creation of a new school
 
02:45:50.990 --> 02:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
district presents overall Revenue
 
02:45:52.969 --> 02:45:52.979 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the Newfound District
 
02:45:56.510 --> 02:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
the sau4 and as outlined in the bill if
 
02:45:58.730 --> 02:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
the district is willing to enter into a
 
02:46:00.770 --> 02:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
fair tuition and administrative service
 
02:46:03.290 --> 02:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
agreement it will have the benefit of a
 
02:46:05.030 --> 02:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
revenue stream for ongoing capital
 
02:46:07.550 --> 02:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
projects and something that we haven't
 
02:46:10.670 --> 02:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
discussed today is we believe that we
 
02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
will have the capacity particularly if
 
02:46:16.250 --> 02:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
we add an additional four classrooms
 
02:46:20.469 --> 02:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
um for K-8 reciprocity so we would bring
 
02:46:23.330 --> 02:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
Innovative schooling options to the
 
02:46:25.790 --> 02:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
entire region as opposed to just the
 
02:46:27.050 --> 02:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
three towns
 
02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
the current student count of Bridgewater
 
02:46:32.090 --> 02:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
Hebron Groton is roughly 15 percent of
 
02:46:34.309 --> 02:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
the overall SAU as was previously
 
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned our corresponding budget
 
02:46:40.130 --> 02:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
contribution is about 16 percent of the
 
02:46:42.050 --> 02:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
total budget
 
02:46:44.270 --> 02:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
when I run the numbers and I estimate
 
02:46:46.130 --> 02:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
the reduction in the elementary and
 
02:46:48.110 --> 02:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
middle school expenses coupled with
 
02:46:51.469 --> 02:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
potential SAU 4 gains in tuition and
 
02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
administrative service Revenue
 
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
there'd be little to no fiscal impact to
 
02:46:58.790 --> 02:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
the current District
 
02:47:01.010 --> 02:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
the bill should also not adversely
 
02:47:03.230 --> 02:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
affect District jobs or teachers if
 
02:47:04.969 --> 02:47:04.979 align:start position:0%
anything this bill should create jobs
 
02:47:07.790 --> 02:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
not reduce them an expanded Bridgewater
 
02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
heben Groton School will need to hire
 
02:47:12.290 --> 02:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
several additional teachers for the
 
02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
sixth through eighth grades the
 
02:47:16.330 --> 02:47:16.340 align:start position:0%
legislation also contains a provision
 
02:47:19.010 --> 02:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
offering current teachers and staff a
 
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
transfer of pay benefits and pension
 
02:47:24.170 --> 02:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
again tuition and service contracts
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
should support the current Staffing
 
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
levels at sau4
 
02:47:30.710 --> 02:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
I envisioned that one of those tuition
 
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
agreements would also provide for sports
 
02:47:34.490 --> 02:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
and extracurricular activities
 
02:47:37.130 --> 02:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
specifically for the grade six through
 
02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
eight which is a critical component of
 
02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
modern education
 
02:47:43.490 --> 02:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
establishing our own school district and
 
02:47:46.849 --> 02:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
reconfiguring the K-8 will come at a
 
02:47:49.370 --> 02:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
cost to Startup costs for us
 
02:47:52.130 --> 02:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
we anticipate the construction of
 
02:47:55.070 --> 02:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
additional classrooms for K-8 hiring
 
02:47:57.950 --> 02:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
teachers support staff and of course the
 
02:47:59.929 --> 02:47:59.939 align:start position:0%
cost of the tuition agreements and the
 
02:48:01.790 --> 02:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
administration and extracurricular
 
02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:02.990 align:start position:0%
administration and extracurricular
agreements

02:48:02.990 --> 02:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
02:48:04.790 --> 02:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
these all come with the attendant
 
02:48:07.490 --> 02:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
startup costs which we're well aware of
 
02:48:09.530 --> 02:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure for providing the
 
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
local elementary education is already in
 
02:48:14.090 --> 02:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
place we own the building the athletic
 
02:48:18.650 --> 02:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
Foods fields and fortuitously we plan
 
02:48:21.050 --> 02:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
for additional
 
02:48:21.060 --> 02:48:21.889 align:start position:0%
for additional
um

02:48:21.889 --> 02:48:21.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:25.250 --> 02:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
future expansion so we'll simply shift
 
02:48:27.469 --> 02:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
those operational costs
 
02:48:29.330 --> 02:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
there are many components to running a
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
school districts we've operated and
 
02:48:34.250 --> 02:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
maintained our school probably about 90
 
02:48:38.510 --> 02:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
percent of the uh the ongoing costs for
 
02:48:39.950 --> 02:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
22 years
 
02:48:42.170 --> 02:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
many of our citizens have been involved
 
02:48:43.610 --> 02:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
at multiple levels in the school
 
02:48:45.530 --> 02:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
district from school board and budget
 
02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
committee members to teachers and staff
 
02:48:48.969 --> 02:48:48.979 align:start position:0%
you've heard some of them today
 
02:48:50.809 --> 02:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
including a former New Hampshire
 
02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education we have a very
 
02:48:56.809 --> 02:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
deep pool of resources and experience to
 
02:48:59.210 --> 02:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
draw from
 
02:49:01.370 --> 02:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
outsourced functions that would require
 
02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
special expertise or need economies of
 
02:49:06.410 --> 02:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
scale the overall intent of the bill is
 
02:49:08.210 --> 02:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
to provide the same or expanded
 
02:49:08.220 --> 02:49:09.770 align:start position:0%
to provide the same or expanded
opportunities

02:49:09.770 --> 02:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
02:49:13.010 --> 02:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
with tuition agreements with a larger
 
02:49:15.050 --> 02:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
District if required
 
02:49:17.750 --> 02:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
this process needs to be thoughtful and
 
02:49:20.990 --> 02:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
considered that's why the bill contains
 
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
a four-year planning and review
 
02:49:25.070 --> 02:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
provision we don't have all the answers
 
02:49:28.010 --> 02:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
right now we'd like to explore them in
 
02:49:30.710 --> 02:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
the end the voters will decide again our
 
02:49:32.929 --> 02:49:32.939 align:start position:0%
situation is unique no other town has a
 
02:49:35.210 --> 02:49:35.220 align:start position:0%
similar structure we're dealing with a
 
02:49:37.190 --> 02:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
set of circumstances where the students
 
02:49:39.290 --> 02:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
of Bridgewater Hebron and Groton will be
 
02:49:41.389 --> 02:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
educated in a school that's already
 
02:49:43.849 --> 02:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
owned by two of our towns
 
02:49:45.590 --> 02:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
finally this bill will increase
 
02:49:48.290 --> 02:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities for parents in
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
the entire area and ensure elementary
 
02:49:52.730 --> 02:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
and middle school education that is
 
02:49:56.270 --> 02:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
local and locally controlled overall it
 
02:49:57.770 --> 02:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
allows for a greater focus on
 
02:50:00.770 --> 02:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
educational outcomes thank you thank you

experiencing a family crisis
 
02:50:48.650 --> 02:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
due to the shortage of affordable

housing Ben's mother has been unable to
 
02:50:52.969 --> 02:50:52.979 align:start position:0%
locate permanent housing
 
02:50:55.010 --> 02:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
my husband and I offered to have Ben

third grade there at the beginning of
 
02:51:05.210 --> 02:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
the school year
 
02:51:07.270 --> 02:51:07.280 align:start position:0%

particularly reading and has been
 
02:51:11.630 --> 02:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with autism
 
02:51:14.090 --> 02:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
before he came to live with us Ben was
 
02:51:16.250 --> 02:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a larger School District in
 
02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the state and had
 
02:51:20.330 --> 02:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
never been in a mainstream classroom
 
02:51:22.490 --> 02:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
at the Bridgewater Hebron Village School
 
02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%

his peers and is thriving in the small
 
02:51:30.469 --> 02:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
classroom setting in large classroom
 
02:51:33.469 --> 02:51:33.479 align:start position:0%
situations Ben is overwhelmed and
 
02:51:36.110 --> 02:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
confused by all the stimulation Ben
 
02:51:38.570 --> 02:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
would benefit enormously by being able
 
02:51:40.969 --> 02:51:40.979 align:start position:0%
to remain in a small classroom setting
 
02:51:43.969 --> 02:51:43.979 align:start position:0%
for as long as he possibly can he has
 
02:51:45.889 --> 02:51:45.899 align:start position:0%
gained a strong awareness of school
 
02:51:48.170 --> 02:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
community and the feeling of belonging
 
02:51:49.969 --> 02:51:49.979 align:start position:0%
being at the Bridgewater Hebron Village
 
02:51:52.969 --> 02:51:52.979 align:start position:0%
School in fact he received a growth

mindset award last fall and was so proud
 
02:51:56.870 --> 02:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
when he brought that award home to show
 
02:51:56.880 --> 02:51:58.010 align:start position:0%
when he brought that award home to show
everyone

everyone
 
02:52:00.290 --> 02:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
the adage it takes a village to raise a
 
02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
child is true
 
02:52:03.650 --> 02:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
the small school Village environment
 
02:52:05.510 --> 02:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
within the Bridgewater Hebron Village
 
02:52:08.090 --> 02:52:08.100 align:start position:0%

help Benjamin and others to continue to
 
02:52:20.450 --> 02:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
grow emotionally and academically in
 
02:52:22.730 --> 02:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
this small setting for as long as they
 
02:52:25.070 --> 02:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
can by allowing Bridgewater Hebron and
 
02:52:27.530 --> 02:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
Groton to form our own school district
 
02:52:31.130 --> 02:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
and reconfigure our schools to a K-8
 
02:52:33.230 --> 02:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
model thank you to the committee for
 
02:52:35.210 --> 02:52:35.220 align:start position:0%

45 minutes south of there and he was
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
there for the elementary school we were
 
02:53:39.889 --> 02:53:39.899 align:start position:0%
very happy with elementary school but
 
02:53:42.110 --> 02:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
the middle school and high school were
 
02:53:45.050 --> 02:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
having issues receiving accreditation
 
02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:47.520 align:start position:0%

02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
happened we found ourselves in Groton
 
02:53:55.250 --> 02:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I transferred Caleb out of
 
02:53:56.630 --> 02:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
his current elementary school into
 
02:53:59.090 --> 02:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater Hebron Village School as
 
02:54:00.790 --> 02:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
with any transfer we had concerns
 
02:54:02.929 --> 02:54:02.939 align:start position:0%
concerns about the education he would
 
02:54:05.090 --> 02:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
receive how the teachers would be making
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
new friends and the support that he
 
02:54:09.170 --> 02:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
would receive it didn't take long at
 
02:54:10.790 --> 02:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater Hebron school to relieve us
 
02:54:12.530 --> 02:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
of these concerns especially the concern
 
02:54:14.090 --> 02:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
about him receiving the best education
 
02:54:16.610 --> 02:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
he can this is where Caleb received a
 
02:54:18.530 --> 02:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
great education where he felt the most
 
02:54:20.330 --> 02:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
comfortable where he made some of his
 
02:54:23.210 --> 02:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
best friends and felt the most supported
 
02:54:25.370 --> 02:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
by the incredible teachers and staff
 
02:54:27.290 --> 02:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
one of the main reasons I support this
 
02:54:29.030 --> 02:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
bill as I do with Caleb I want all
 
02:54:31.309 --> 02:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
students to receive a better education I
 
02:54:32.809 --> 02:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
feel Caleb would have benefited even
 
02:54:34.250 --> 02:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
more from staying in the Bridgewater
 
02:54:36.490 --> 02:54:36.500 align:start position:0%
Hebron School District a little longer
 
02:54:38.570 --> 02:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
K-8 models have been proven to be
 
02:54:40.070 --> 02:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
beneficial and have many advantages
 
02:54:42.349 --> 02:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
currently our students leave the
 
02:54:43.849 --> 02:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater Hebron school after fifth
 
02:54:45.950 --> 02:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
grade and go to the Middle School
 
02:54:47.809 --> 02:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
a K-8 model would eliminate the
 
02:54:49.250 --> 02:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
transition and allow them to stay where
 
02:54:50.630 --> 02:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
they're more comfortable for a few more
 
02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:51.590 align:start position:0%
they're more comfortable for a few more
years

02:54:51.590 --> 02:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:54:53.090 --> 02:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
the age that they attend Middle School
 
02:54:54.469 --> 02:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
is awkward time for these kids
 
02:54:55.969 --> 02:54:55.979 align:start position:0%
physically mentally and emotionally
 
02:54:58.190 --> 02:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
they're going through so many changes
 
02:54:59.870 --> 02:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
when they leave Bridgewater Hebron
 
02:55:01.130 --> 02:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
school they're transitioning from being
 
02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
the older students at the school to then
 
02:55:04.370 --> 02:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
again becoming the younger students at
 
02:55:06.230 --> 02:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
the middle school all of this can be
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
very tough on kids and can lead to
 
02:55:08.870 --> 02:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
challenges while they're in the Middle
 
02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:09.650 align:start position:0%
challenges while they're in the Middle
School

02:55:09.650 --> 02:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
School
 
02:55:11.450 --> 02:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
we live in a rural community in
 
02:55:13.490 --> 02:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater Hebron Village school is
 
02:55:14.750 --> 02:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
closer to our town than the middle
 
02:55:16.969 --> 02:55:16.979 align:start position:0%
school and high school is our Groton
 
02:55:18.050 --> 02:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
students are on the bus for about an
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
hour to the middle school and even
 
02:55:21.230 --> 02:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
longer to the high school this is too
 
02:55:22.910 --> 02:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
long especially grades k through eight
 
02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
to be on a bus creating a k-3 model
 
02:55:27.349 --> 02:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the extra time on the
 
02:55:29.030 --> 02:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
bus then when they're older and can
 
02:55:31.070 --> 02:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
handle the bus a little bit longer then
 
02:55:32.990 --> 02:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
that would be more suitable for them
 
02:55:34.849 --> 02:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
I also feel Caleb would have benefited
 
02:55:36.290 --> 02:55:36.300 align:start position:0%
from being able to choose which high
 
02:55:37.849 --> 02:55:37.859 align:start position:0%
school he attended there are high
 
02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
schools that are actually closer to
 
02:55:41.269 --> 02:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
Groton in high school our kids get their
 
02:55:43.490 --> 02:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
licenses which is a very scary time for
 
02:55:44.750 --> 02:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
us parents
 
02:55:47.090 --> 02:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
we where we live also weathers are very
 
02:55:50.330 --> 02:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
concerned we have a lot of snow and icy
 
02:55:52.490 --> 02:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
situations and we are able to choose a
 
02:55:54.050 --> 02:55:54.060 align:start position:0%
high school that he attended he would
 
02:55:55.490 --> 02:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
have been able to choose one closer to
 
02:55:57.950 --> 02:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
him with less travel time save on gas
 
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
money and less worrying during the bad
 
02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:01.250 align:start position:0%
money and less worrying during the bad
weather

02:56:01.250 --> 02:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
weather
 
02:56:03.830 --> 02:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
he also didn't play sports but he jumped
 
02:56:05.870 --> 02:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
into the workforce quickly he would have
 
02:56:07.730 --> 02:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
traveled right from school to work each
 
02:56:09.469 --> 02:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
day if he could have chosen a high
 
02:56:10.969 --> 02:56:10.979 align:start position:0%
school close to where he works it would
 
02:56:12.710 --> 02:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
have been more convenient and save money
 
02:56:14.090 --> 02:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
on travel as well
 
02:56:16.370 --> 02:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
I no longer have children in the school
 
02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
district but I am still advocating for
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
all of the other children we had an
 
02:56:21.530 --> 02:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
amazing experience at Bridgewater Hebron
 
02:56:23.210 --> 02:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
Village school and I wish the K-8 model
 
02:56:25.250 --> 02:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
was in effect when Caleb was in school
 
02:56:27.170 --> 02:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening and I
 
02:56:28.849 --> 02:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge you to pass this bill
 
02:56:30.469 --> 02:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
so all of our students can receive the
 
02:56:32.389 --> 02:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
best education that they deserve thank
 
02:56:34.190 --> 02:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
you very much and any questions from the
 
02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:35.809 align:start position:0%
you very much and any questions from the
committee

02:56:35.809 --> 02:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:56:42.889 --> 02:56:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:56.950 --> 02:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:59.269 --> 02:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman and members of the
 
02:56:59.279 --> 02:57:00.290 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman and members of the
committee

02:57:00.290 --> 02:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:57:03.950 --> 02:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
um I will be brief as much of what I
 
02:57:05.450 --> 02:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
said was said earlier by the
 
02:57:07.130 --> 02:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
superintendent but I am here to speak
 
02:57:10.550 --> 02:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
against HB 349
 
02:57:13.670 --> 02:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
um as you may not be aware aft New
 
02:57:13.680 --> 02:57:14.650 align:start position:0%
um as you may not be aware aft New
Hampshire

02:57:14.650 --> 02:57:14.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:57:17.690 --> 02:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
represents the Newfound teachers union
 
02:57:20.450 --> 02:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
they're part of our our Federation
 
02:57:23.090 --> 02:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
um so I've heard some concerns and
 
02:57:25.309 --> 02:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
because of that I would like to speak
 
02:57:27.349 --> 02:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
against this I must say though I've been
 
02:57:29.210 --> 02:57:29.220 align:start position:0%
impressed by all of the passion I've
 
02:57:30.650 --> 02:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
heard from the supporters of this bill
 
02:57:30.660 --> 02:57:32.269 align:start position:0%
heard from the supporters of this bill
and

02:57:32.269 --> 02:57:32.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:57:32.279 --> 02:57:33.170 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:57:33.170 --> 02:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:35.389 --> 02:57:35.399 align:start position:0%
I think their involvement in their
 
02:57:38.870 --> 02:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
education and you know the the Zeal they
 
02:57:41.450 --> 02:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
have for seeing the right thing done for
 
02:57:43.130 --> 02:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
their students in their school is
 
02:57:45.650 --> 02:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
commendable I just am not sure that
 
02:57:48.590 --> 02:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
creating a new process
 
02:57:51.349 --> 02:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
to essentially undo a Cooperative School
 
02:57:53.210 --> 02:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
District a Regional School District is
 
02:57:54.710 --> 02:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
the right way to go about it that's
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's where my disagreement with this
 
02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
is there already is a process uh which
 
02:58:04.250 --> 02:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier RSA 195.
 
02:58:04.260 --> 02:58:05.170 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier RSA 195.
um

02:58:05.170 --> 02:58:05.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:08.809 --> 02:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
to withdraw from a Regional School
 
02:58:08.819 --> 02:58:09.950 align:start position:0%
to withdraw from a Regional School
District

02:58:09.950 --> 02:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
District
 
02:58:12.170 --> 02:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate that you know there was
 
02:58:14.210 --> 02:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
a four-year timeline talked about it's
 
02:58:16.670 --> 02:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
not thoroughly described in this bill it
 
02:58:17.929 --> 02:58:17.939 align:start position:0%
was more thoroughly described in your
 
02:58:20.210 --> 02:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
presentation but it does talk about a
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
vote that would start next month on
 
02:58:25.250 --> 02:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
starting this whole process
 
02:58:26.809 --> 02:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
um and then the certificate of
 
02:58:29.150 --> 02:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
withdrawal will be issued in about a
 
02:58:30.889 --> 02:58:30.899 align:start position:0%
year you know if the three towns
 
02:58:34.550 --> 02:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
approved I have members of the Newfound
 
02:58:37.550 --> 02:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
teachers union who are also not just
 
02:58:39.950 --> 02:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
employees of the district but also
 
02:58:42.590 --> 02:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
parents and taxpayers of towns in the
 
02:58:45.950 --> 02:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
district who are just hearing about this
 
02:58:47.929 --> 02:58:47.939 align:start position:0%
so yeah they could be asked to vote on
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
it in a month things that will
 
02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
significantly change their work life and
 
02:58:55.130 --> 02:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
also if their parents change things
 
02:58:58.010 --> 02:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
about their students school starting you
 
02:59:00.110 --> 02:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
know possibly as soon as next year so
 
02:59:02.929 --> 02:59:02.939 align:start position:0%
it's a great it's a concern what is this
 
02:59:05.330 --> 02:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
going to look like and the concerns they
 
02:59:07.429 --> 02:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
have that they don't have the answers to
 
02:59:10.550 --> 02:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
and again some of the people here gave
 
02:59:12.050 --> 02:59:12.060 align:start position:0%
wonderful answers of where they would
 
02:59:13.190 --> 02:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
like to go
 
02:59:18.849 --> 02:59:18.859 align:start position:0%
but that discussion has not been
 
02:59:21.790 --> 02:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
as fully
 
02:59:23.809 --> 02:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
gone through
 
02:59:27.170 --> 02:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
um to members of the community as it
 
02:59:29.269 --> 02:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
needs to because the questions are still
 
02:59:31.309 --> 02:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
out there what's going to happen to the
 
02:59:33.110 --> 02:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
students particularly the students in
 
02:59:35.269 --> 02:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
grades five through eight
 
02:59:37.250 --> 02:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
um in these three towns that was a
 
02:59:39.710 --> 02:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
question that I had delayed to me that
 
02:59:41.870 --> 02:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
is a big concern
 
02:59:41.880 --> 02:59:42.410 align:start position:0%
is a big concern
um

02:59:42.410 --> 02:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:46.309 --> 02:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
so I I hear talk of well we can tuition
 
02:59:48.290 --> 02:59:48.300 align:start position:0%
them into the Newfound area District
 
02:59:50.330 --> 02:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
once we are declared withdrawn from it
 
02:59:53.030 --> 02:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
if the three towns passed this on March
 
02:59:53.040 --> 02:59:54.590 align:start position:0%
if the three towns passed this on March
23rd

02:59:54.590 --> 02:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
23rd
 
02:59:57.170 --> 02:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
well that's presupposing that a tuition
 
02:59:59.090 --> 02:59:59.100 align:start position:0%
agreement can be reached and that you
 
03:00:01.370 --> 03:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
know everything will work out and it
 
03:00:03.170 --> 03:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
probably will I mean good intention to
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
everyone's part but it's a very
 
03:00:07.370 --> 03:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
unsettling feeling if you don't know
 
03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
where your students going to school in a
 
03:00:12.650 --> 03:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
year and that was your plan and your
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
choice and where you wanted them to go
 
03:00:15.359 --> 03:00:16.730 align:start position:0%
choice and where you wanted them to go
um

03:00:16.730 --> 03:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:18.290 --> 03:00:18.300 align:start position:0%
the other question is what's going to
 
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
happen to the staff they are employees
 
03:00:22.790 --> 03:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the Newfound Area School District
 
03:00:24.830 --> 03:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
they are not employees of the The
 
03:00:27.769 --> 03:00:27.779 align:start position:0%
Village School I I appreciate that it
 
03:00:31.010 --> 03:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
says that the new district will
 
03:00:33.050 --> 03:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
uh seek to offer employment
 
03:00:35.570 --> 03:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh the collective
 
03:00:37.790 --> 03:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement is with the current
 
03:00:40.550 --> 03:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
Regional School District so
 
03:00:43.550 --> 03:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
there would be a whole process there
 
03:00:43.560 --> 03:00:44.389 align:start position:0%
there would be a whole process there
um

03:00:44.389 --> 03:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:46.210 --> 03:00:46.220 align:start position:0%
and that's going to
 
03:00:48.950 --> 03:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
get into you know some questions of
 
03:00:51.590 --> 03:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
making sure that everything is done to
 
03:00:56.330 --> 03:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
make sure the employees retain you know
 
03:00:58.130 --> 03:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
their current pay and benefit and are
 
03:01:00.349 --> 03:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
made whole and we have great great
 
03:01:03.889 --> 03:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
concerns about that we also know that a
 
03:01:06.170 --> 03:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
school is more than just a building it's
 
03:01:07.790 --> 03:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
a community of all the people who work
 
03:01:10.010 --> 03:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
there and all the students who go there
 
03:01:13.670 --> 03:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
so if you are not holding on to the
 
03:01:15.769 --> 03:01:15.779 align:start position:0%
employees because maybe they don't want
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
to work for this new entity for whatever
 
03:01:17.279 --> 03:01:18.769 align:start position:0%
to work for this new entity for whatever
reason

03:01:18.769 --> 03:01:18.779 align:start position:0%
reason
 
03:01:18.779 --> 03:01:20.450 align:start position:0%
reason
um

03:01:20.450 --> 03:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:23.330 --> 03:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
then what happens yeah just imagine that
 
03:01:26.090 --> 03:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
your student you you have a child who
 
03:01:28.490 --> 03:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
had a great second grade teacher
 
03:01:30.230 --> 03:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
so they went into second grade and this
 
03:01:33.290 --> 03:01:33.300 align:start position:0%
teacher was a perfect fit
 
03:01:36.590 --> 03:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
yeah spark that Joy of learning ease
 
03:01:38.510 --> 03:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
that anxiety about being in school I
 
03:01:40.250 --> 03:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
went from you know the student went from
 
03:01:43.610 --> 03:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
being kind of oh math is hard to being I
 
03:01:45.650 --> 03:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
love math I want to do multiplication
 
03:01:47.510 --> 03:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm excited to go to school every day
 
03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:49.790 align:start position:0%
I'm excited to go to school every day
marvelous

03:01:49.790 --> 03:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
marvelous
 
03:01:54.110 --> 03:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
now we've got this huge change and Mrs
 
03:01:56.690 --> 03:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
so-and-so isn't there and you're
 
03:01:58.490 --> 03:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
four-year-old isn't going to have the
 
03:02:00.530 --> 03:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
chance to have Mrs so-and-so when she
 
03:02:03.349 --> 03:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
gets into school this is a big change is
 
03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
being made really fast and we're
 
03:02:07.730 --> 03:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
inventing a new process to do it
 
03:02:09.710 --> 03:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
for those reasons I've got to speak
 
03:02:11.889 --> 03:02:11.899 align:start position:0%
against this Bill thank you very much
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:02:18.170 --> 03:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you I wait
 
03:02:19.010 --> 03:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
for someone that may have the
 
03:02:20.450 --> 03:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
information which I forgot to ask before
 
03:02:22.130 --> 03:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
so I hope we have can you tell me what
 
03:02:24.410 --> 03:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
the average class size is at the current
 
03:02:27.889 --> 03:02:27.899 align:start position:0%
K5 school at the current K5 school I
 
03:02:30.590 --> 03:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
would have to ask so I don't have that
 
03:02:32.929 --> 03:02:32.939 align:start position:0%
information okay you know at my
 
03:02:34.429 --> 03:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
fingertips I would have to ask I
 
03:02:37.730 --> 03:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
apologize okay but average class size
 
03:02:41.630 --> 03:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you further
 
03:02:43.370 --> 03:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative dry yeah
 
03:02:44.630 --> 03:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:02:46.190 --> 03:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
taking me a question
 
03:02:48.469 --> 03:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
um we heard a lot about the bus ride how
 
03:02:50.870 --> 03:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
would they solve that problem if this
 
03:02:52.370 --> 03:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't go through
 
03:02:54.290 --> 03:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
now would I solve that problem not you
 
03:02:54.300 --> 03:02:56.410 align:start position:0%
now would I solve that problem not you
okay

03:02:56.410 --> 03:02:56.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:02:58.969 --> 03:02:58.979 align:start position:0%
might that be solved how that might how
 
03:03:00.530 --> 03:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
might that be solved
 
03:03:00.540 --> 03:03:02.389 align:start position:0%
might that be solved
um

03:03:02.389 --> 03:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:02.399 --> 03:03:04.790 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

03:03:04.790 --> 03:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:03:08.150 --> 03:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
yeah that that is a great question and I
 
03:03:10.070 --> 03:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
do not have a solution off the top of my
 
03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:10.969 align:start position:0%
do not have a solution off the top of my
head

03:03:10.969 --> 03:03:10.979 align:start position:0%
head
 
03:03:13.269 --> 03:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
um again I think this is a commendable
 
03:03:16.370 --> 03:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
effort behind what they want to do but I
 
03:03:17.630 --> 03:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
also think the process they're doing
 
03:03:20.830 --> 03:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't involved the whole the whole
 
03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
Regional School District Community which
 
03:03:25.130 --> 03:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
is what you need to do to withdraw from
 
03:03:26.450 --> 03:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
a Regional School District you have to
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
involve all of the players
 
03:03:31.429 --> 03:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
um because they are all one school
 
03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
community at this point so I I really
 
03:03:37.910 --> 03:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
think creating a law
 
03:03:40.370 --> 03:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
because you couldn't get it done through
 
03:03:42.050 --> 03:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
the other process
 
03:03:46.849 --> 03:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
isn't really what we normally do is it
 
03:03:46.859 --> 03:03:48.889 align:start position:0%
isn't really what we normally do is it
um

03:03:48.889 --> 03:03:48.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:51.290 --> 03:03:51.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the questions
 
03:03:53.630 --> 03:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
thank you I have one card left it's
 
03:03:57.170 --> 03:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
right here Aubry Friedman
 
03:04:00.230 --> 03:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
Aubry you put down more than the three
 
03:04:02.170 --> 03:04:02.180 align:start position:0%
or four minutes
 
03:04:05.150 --> 03:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you that's appreciated
 
03:04:08.090 --> 03:04:08.100 align:start position:0%
so I'll just uh you said three minutes
 
03:04:10.130 --> 03:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
I'll try to stick to three points thank
 
03:04:12.710 --> 03:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chairman committee members
 
03:04:15.290 --> 03:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
Aubrey Friedman Bridgewater I speak in
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
03:04:17.520 --> 03:04:18.469 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
um

03:04:18.469 --> 03:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:20.809 --> 03:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
that first I just want to preface by
 
03:04:23.570 --> 03:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
saying when I come to the state house to
 
03:04:26.269 --> 03:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
testify for against a bill I don't just
 
03:04:28.670 --> 03:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
do it for my personal benefit or you
 
03:04:29.929 --> 03:04:29.939 align:start position:0%
know how's this going to I think about
 
03:04:33.050 --> 03:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
the principles and the bigger picture
 
03:04:35.330 --> 03:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
but in this case I do live in
 
03:04:37.490 --> 03:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater so you might think well he's
 
03:04:40.090 --> 03:04:40.100 align:start position:0%
he's got like a vested interest and I do
 
03:04:43.010 --> 03:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh but my reasons for supporting this
 
03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
bill are still my lofty ones the
 
03:04:49.550 --> 03:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
principles of uh and the the big thing
 
03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of this bill it's an opt-out
 
03:04:55.210 --> 03:04:55.220 align:start position:0%
for these three towns and they are stuck
 
03:05:00.110 --> 03:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
in this big sprawling uh Co-op district
 
03:05:02.630 --> 03:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
and they will not be able to get out
 
03:05:04.969 --> 03:05:04.979 align:start position:0%
through this current process because
 
03:05:07.730 --> 03:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
it's so obvious and I have friends who
 
03:05:09.410 --> 03:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
are in the other towns the four other
 
03:05:12.590 --> 03:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
towns and I hear that
 
03:05:14.570 --> 03:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
they're never gonna you just get
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
outvoted so that's why they went this
 
03:05:19.849 --> 03:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
route but the more important thing is
 
03:05:23.210 --> 03:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
this is options for not only the
 
03:05:25.670 --> 03:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
families in the three towns but the
 
03:05:27.230 --> 03:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
other four towns because I think that
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
how this is going to work out because
 
03:05:32.090 --> 03:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
the Bridgewater Hebron has got room for
 
03:05:33.710 --> 03:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
other students so there's going to be
 
03:05:37.730 --> 03:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
tuition tuition excuse me tuitioning in
 
03:05:39.710 --> 03:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
and out of all these schools there are
 
03:05:42.710 --> 03:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
also might be parents who are they're
 
03:05:44.570 --> 03:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
happy with the Middle School somebody in
 
03:05:46.849 --> 03:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
the Bridgewater Hebron their kid does
 
03:05:49.790 --> 03:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
well in the middle school right now so
 
03:05:51.950 --> 03:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
they might want to choose that so I
 
03:05:53.690 --> 03:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
think there's going to be enough
 
03:05:55.790 --> 03:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
flexibility here especially with
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment you're going to
 
03:05:59.929 --> 03:05:59.939 align:start position:0%
want to get all the kids you want that I
 
03:06:03.110 --> 03:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
think there'll be more options for all
 
03:06:05.690 --> 03:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
the parents but of course mainly for the
 
03:06:07.550 --> 03:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
three towns that are really different
 
03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
from the other four so this expands
 
03:06:14.090 --> 03:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
options as for K through 8 versus
 
03:06:14.100 --> 03:06:15.550 align:start position:0%
options as for K through 8 versus
traditional

03:06:15.550 --> 03:06:15.560 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
03:06:18.170 --> 03:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
there's a whole body of literature out
 
03:06:19.849 --> 03:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
there as to the advantages or
 
03:06:22.190 --> 03:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
disadvantages I say let the parents
 
03:06:25.190 --> 03:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
choose and I think some parents might
 
03:06:26.690 --> 03:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
just be very happy with the middle
 
03:06:28.429 --> 03:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
school is and they'd rather have their
 
03:06:31.429 --> 03:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
kids go there let them choose this way I
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
really think with the tuitioning in and
 
03:06:35.510 --> 03:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
out there'll just be more options for
 
03:06:38.150 --> 03:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
everybody so I think that's the main
 
03:06:41.269 --> 03:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
advantage of this bill and to be able to
 
03:06:43.969 --> 03:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
you can't get this believing I go to the
 
03:06:46.250 --> 03:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
school board meetings and I know how
 
03:06:48.969 --> 03:06:48.979 align:start position:0%
this sau4 works it's it's a big
 
03:06:52.309 --> 03:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and the spending is out of
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
control and the proficiencies are not
 
03:06:56.570 --> 03:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
good at all and by the way I also wanted
 
03:06:59.510 --> 03:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
to add uh they're not all that great at
 
03:07:02.210 --> 03:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
the Bridgewater Hebron school but if you
 
03:07:05.030 --> 03:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
compare there's four elementary schools
 
03:07:07.130 --> 03:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
and I'm big on scores and proficiencies
 
03:07:09.170 --> 03:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
and everything really the Bridgewater
 
03:07:11.809 --> 03:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
Hebron does have better proficiency
 
03:07:14.030 --> 03:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
results so they're doing something right
 
03:07:16.730 --> 03:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
there and maybe the involvement of the
 
03:07:18.950 --> 03:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
parents I'm not sure what it is that
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
causes that school to look better but it
 
03:07:25.190 --> 03:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
does so they they're on to something
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
good and if they want to try a k through
 
03:07:30.170 --> 03:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
eight and do tuitioning in and out here
 
03:07:31.550 --> 03:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
and there I think it's better for
 
03:07:35.030 --> 03:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
everybody so uh I I the only thing I
 
03:07:37.070 --> 03:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to add just I wish this bill
 
03:07:39.170 --> 03:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
could have been for all other towns but
 
03:07:41.570 --> 03:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
I was told because it's a very specific
 
03:07:43.969 --> 03:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
because two of the towns own that one
 
03:07:46.849 --> 03:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
school it's a unique it has to be
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
written very specific I wish they could
 
03:07:50.990 --> 03:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
have done this to all towns in New
 
03:07:52.610 --> 03:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are stuck in big school
 
03:07:54.410 --> 03:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
districts that don't really work for
 
03:07:58.070 --> 03:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
their families so I support the bill and
 
03:08:00.170 --> 03:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
and that's it thank you thank you any
 
03:08:01.250 --> 03:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
03:08:04.130 --> 03:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden thank you uh Mr
 
03:08:05.690 --> 03:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:08:07.670 --> 03:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions I'm just looking for a little
 
03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
clarifications a lot of emotion and such
 
03:08:12.349 --> 03:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
a you know an event like this in the
 
03:08:14.750 --> 03:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
communities can you just I think you
 
03:08:16.250 --> 03:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
touched on it a little little bit in
 
03:08:18.889 --> 03:08:18.899 align:start position:0%
your testimony but can you clarify for
 
03:08:22.910 --> 03:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
me why the current 195 26 withdrawal
 
03:08:25.490 --> 03:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
process that's on the statute in the
 
03:08:29.269 --> 03:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
statutes does not work in this instant
 
03:08:33.170 --> 03:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
well these seven towns are going to have
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
to if the three somebody wants to get
 
03:08:38.750 --> 03:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
get out of this school district the
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
seven towns are going to vote you've got
 
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
the heavier populated on the other four
 
03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
towns and is already tons of animosity
 
03:08:51.710 --> 03:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
about the uh tax rates and all that it's
 
03:08:54.170 --> 03:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
never going to happen and that's why
 
03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
they did this thank you
 
03:08:59.030 --> 03:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes represent
 
03:09:00.889 --> 03:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
Woodcock you know what this uh thank you
 
03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is perhaps for you as the person
 
03:09:05.330 --> 03:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
who submitted the bill and I know you're
 
03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
going to adjourn at the last speaker so
 
03:09:07.490 --> 03:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
I want to be able to get the question
 
03:09:12.230 --> 03:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe answered uh I in my re I
 
03:09:14.030 --> 03:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
thought I was reading this bill that
 
03:09:16.309 --> 03:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
just the the intent of the bill was to
 
03:09:18.290 --> 03:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
allow the school district to separate
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
and create their own new school district
 
03:09:22.130 --> 03:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
but am I missing that does it say that
 
03:09:24.230 --> 03:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
it has to be K-8 I thought I'd
 
03:09:26.330 --> 03:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
understand this was a k it doesn't say
 
03:09:28.790 --> 03:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
they can't go to K8 but as it's red it's
 
03:09:30.410 --> 03:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
just the K-5 school district is that
 
03:09:30.420 --> 03:09:31.370 align:start position:0%
just the K-5 school district is that
correct

03:09:31.370 --> 03:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:09:34.610 --> 03:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a K5 right now and the
 
03:09:36.889 --> 03:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
intent and I think down the road because
 
03:09:40.670 --> 03:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
I I you could go k-6 okay you know not
 
03:09:43.550 --> 03:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
usually don't go with K7 I had k-8s
 
03:09:46.670 --> 03:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
right back in Rumford Maine and West
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
Peru and the K-8 sent the kids to
 
03:09:54.170 --> 03:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
Rumford high school and of which out of
 
03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
the top 10 graduates each year three of
 
03:10:00.769 --> 03:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
those came from the small K-8 in West
 
03:10:03.490 --> 03:10:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:06.349 --> 03:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
not the rationale but it's it's I think
 
03:10:07.550 --> 03:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is to move
 
03:10:09.469 --> 03:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
towards Ka okay but the bill itself is
 
03:10:11.809 --> 03:10:11.819 align:start position:0%
just K-5 separation
 
03:10:11.819 --> 03:10:18.590 align:start position:0%
just K-5 separation
K12

03:10:18.590 --> 03:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:22.730 --> 03:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you thank you we won't
 
03:10:24.170 --> 03:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
be of course working on this and we can
 
03:10:26.090 --> 03:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
look at the fine print in the bill
 
03:10:28.250 --> 03:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:10:29.870 --> 03:10:29.880 align:start position:0%

within the area which I represent
 
04:03:00.050 --> 04:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
there are a number of communities
 
04:03:02.330 --> 04:03:02.340 align:start position:0%

are several which tuition their students
 
04:03:14.510 --> 04:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
out beyond the Elementary grades
 
04:03:16.729 --> 04:03:16.739 align:start position:0%
or beyond the junior high school middle
 
04:03:19.550 --> 04:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
level grades and I'm here today to speak
 
04:03:22.130 --> 04:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
to this bill 275 that's relative to
 
04:03:26.450 --> 04:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
school tuition program by a school board
 
04:03:29.870 --> 04:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is one that's needing some
 
04:03:29.880 --> 04:03:31.090 align:start position:0%
this bill is one that's needing some
resolution

04:03:31.090 --> 04:03:31.100 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
04:03:33.889 --> 04:03:33.899 align:start position:0%
we have had school districts all over
 
04:03:37.130 --> 04:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
the state receiving advice from their
 
04:03:39.889 --> 04:03:39.899 align:start position:0%
attorneys and the advice being provided
 
04:03:42.349 --> 04:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
to those school boards is not always on
 
04:03:44.450 --> 04:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
the same page
 
04:03:46.849 --> 04:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
and so I'd like to go through and walk
 
04:03:46.859 --> 04:03:48.189 align:start position:0%
and so I'd like to go through and walk
through

04:03:48.189 --> 04:03:48.199 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
just the overall concept of what we're
 
04:03:52.910 --> 04:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
talking about here once you all get
 
04:03:54.650 --> 04:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
these sheets that are coming around you
 
04:03:56.450 --> 04:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
should have two right now
 
04:04:01.849 --> 04:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
and there's another one which is the
 
04:04:06.349 --> 04:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
tuition increased limits available high
 
04:04:08.210 --> 04:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
schools which is an article out of the
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.769 --> 04:04:21.779 align:start position:0%
does everybody have those sheets now
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
almost okay that's pretty good
 
04:04:27.530 --> 04:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
my father used to say that you're almost
 
04:04:29.750 --> 04:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
on the green I was in the forest
 
04:04:31.610 --> 04:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
somewhere I couldn't find the ball
 
04:04:31.620 --> 04:04:44.090 align:start position:0%
somewhere I couldn't find the ball
okay

04:04:44.090 --> 04:04:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.610 --> 04:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna go ahead first with one
 
04:04:48.349 --> 04:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
with the arrows and just try to give an
 
04:04:50.450 --> 04:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
overview of this tuition program I'm
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
talking about let's say you're a small
 
04:04:55.130 --> 04:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
district school district of maybe 70
 
04:04:57.769 --> 04:04:57.779 align:start position:0%
kids and it's k through eight
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
all right 80 kids
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
you have to figure out what you're going
 
04:05:04.130 --> 04:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
to do with your kids the students once
 
04:05:06.410 --> 04:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
they finish the eighth grade where do
 
04:05:07.610 --> 04:05:07.620 align:start position:0%
they go
 
04:05:11.090 --> 04:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
and there is a small community within
 
04:05:13.010 --> 04:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
several small communities within my
 
04:05:14.929 --> 04:05:14.939 align:start position:0%
district that are having to make this
 
04:05:14.939 --> 04:05:16.070 align:start position:0%
district that are having to make this
decision

04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
and so you're you you start with a top
 
04:05:20.809 --> 04:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
box on the sheet here and you say yes
 
04:05:24.889 --> 04:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
your your school district let's say k6
 
04:05:26.689 --> 04:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
and then go down the second one it says
 
04:05:28.429 --> 04:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
the sending District identifies and
 
04:05:30.410 --> 04:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
contracts with a receiving school for
 
04:05:33.050 --> 04:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
student education and grades not offered
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
in the residence School the resident
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
board approves these tuition schools so
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the small community of Piermont which
 
04:05:42.469 --> 04:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
is a school district with 70 plus
 
04:05:44.809 --> 04:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
students k through eight actually it's
 
04:05:47.150 --> 04:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
pre-k through eight
 
04:05:48.590 --> 04:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
they have to figure where we're going to
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
send our students
 
04:05:52.550 --> 04:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
and the choices the way they make that
 
04:05:55.250 --> 04:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
decision they take three neighboring
 
04:05:57.710 --> 04:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
high schools which they have approved
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
for attendance
 
04:06:01.610 --> 04:06:01.620 align:start position:0%
in this case it happens to be Rivendell
 
04:06:05.210 --> 04:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
down in Orford which is an interstate
 
04:06:06.830 --> 04:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
government District which in other words
 
04:06:09.290 --> 04:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
it involves the kids from Corinth and
 
04:06:11.330 --> 04:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
fairly Vermont
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
and Orford the other school district
 
04:06:17.210 --> 04:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
they look of or at is Oxbow High School
 
04:06:20.510 --> 04:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
which is located in Bradford Vermont
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
the other school which they look at is
 
04:06:24.769 --> 04:06:24.779 align:start position:0%
Woodsville High School which is located
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
in which well Woodsville is part of
 
04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
Haverhill New Hampshire
 
04:06:31.849 --> 04:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
and they take these these average to
 
04:06:33.710 --> 04:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
attend the three schools they add them
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
up and divide by three and they get the
 
04:06:39.050 --> 04:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
average tuition rate plus an eight
 
04:06:40.849 --> 04:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
percent fudge figure
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
so you get that it comes out a little
 
04:06:45.349 --> 04:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
over what nineteen thousand dollars that
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
they're getting used for
 
04:06:46.800 --> 04:06:48.530 align:start position:0%
they're getting used for
tuition

04:06:48.530 --> 04:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
so that's how that District does others
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily use that same formula
 
04:06:54.650 --> 04:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
that's just how their policy states how
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to develop a formula to
 
04:06:56.640 --> 04:06:57.889 align:start position:0%
they're going to develop a formula to
determine

04:06:57.889 --> 04:06:57.899 align:start position:0%
determine
 
04:06:59.389 --> 04:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
where they're gonna where they're going
 
04:07:00.769 --> 04:07:00.779 align:start position:0%
to be able to send the kids not where
 
04:07:02.570 --> 04:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
but the cap in which they're going to
 
04:07:05.030 --> 04:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
spend on tuition
 
04:07:07.309 --> 04:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
they may have approved other schools for
 
04:07:10.490 --> 04:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
example Piermont at one time had miscoma
 
04:07:12.290 --> 04:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
they had Deptford Academy in Vermont
 
04:07:15.349 --> 04:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
coming up the river they had Oxbow they
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
had rivendale on the other side of the
 
04:07:19.610 --> 04:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
river they had Woodsville and St
 
04:07:22.010 --> 04:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
Johnsbury Academy today they have the
 
04:07:23.689 --> 04:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
three I mentioned but they also have St
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
Johnsbury Academy
 
04:07:28.790 --> 04:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
what happened now is that let's go down
 
04:07:31.070 --> 04:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
the third box the tuition agreement
 
04:07:33.229 --> 04:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
contract is signed by the receiving
 
04:07:34.849 --> 04:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
school and ascending school so we know
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
you have a contract in place the
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
resident District made tuition to
 
04:07:40.750 --> 04:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
multiple public or private schools
 
04:07:43.490 --> 04:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
provided that the primary or the anchor
 
04:07:45.229 --> 04:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
tuition School accepts all tuition
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
grades and meets a minimum Public School
 
04:07:49.130 --> 04:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
approval standards and guarantees
 
04:07:50.929 --> 04:07:50.939 align:start position:0%
placement for all students in other
 
04:07:52.490 --> 04:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
words you provide a special education
 
04:07:54.290 --> 04:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
services and all other related services
 
04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
are needed by youngsters that are going
 
04:07:58.429 --> 04:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
into the ninth grade
 
04:08:01.250 --> 04:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
all the schools which Paramount has do
 
04:08:01.260 --> 04:08:02.630 align:start position:0%
all the schools which Paramount has do
this

04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
going down to the next blocks
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
consideration and selecting a receiving
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
school so now it's up to
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
piermont's approved for schools all four
 
04:08:13.790 --> 04:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned from St Johnsbury
 
04:08:16.910 --> 04:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
Academy St Johnsbury Academy is an
 
04:08:19.429 --> 04:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
independent private school other words
 
04:08:21.830 --> 04:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
they have their Board of Trustees which
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
are not elected but they receive public
 
04:08:28.010 --> 04:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
monies from over supporting
 
04:08:28.020 --> 04:08:29.929 align:start position:0%
monies from over supporting
approximately

04:08:29.929 --> 04:08:29.939 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
04:08:32.929 --> 04:08:32.939 align:start position:0%
I would say approximately around 700 uh
 
04:08:35.570 --> 04:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
public school students from Vermont
 
04:08:37.550 --> 04:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire
 
04:08:39.650 --> 04:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
the remaining of the ground off their
 
04:08:42.050 --> 04:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
population of a thousand come from
 
04:08:44.349 --> 04:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
private tuition all over the world
 
04:08:47.229 --> 04:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
private tuition is approximately
 
04:08:50.570 --> 04:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
61.6 thousand dollars and that's minimal
 
04:08:52.010 --> 04:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
compared to some of the other schools
 
04:08:55.370 --> 04:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
like a Kua or holderness or Vermont
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
Academy Deerfield Exeter Etc St
 
04:08:59.990 --> 04:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
Johnsbury is rated very high amongst all
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
those schools as far as it's like
 
04:09:03.889 --> 04:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
walking onto a college campus different
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
buildings just like a college campus and
 
04:09:08.809 --> 04:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
they offer all the whistles and bells
 
04:09:10.729 --> 04:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
that one would want their own child to
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
have if your child is interested in
 
04:09:15.889 --> 04:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
mathematics they have high levels of
 
04:09:17.170 --> 04:09:17.180 align:start position:0%
math courses
 
04:09:21.889 --> 04:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
in mathematics courses above calculus uh
 
04:09:24.410 --> 04:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
I saw one Advanced course in cursive
 
04:09:26.750 --> 04:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
writing on on their menu and we've
 
04:09:29.389 --> 04:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
talked about cursive writing but
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
all the schools offer certain things
 
04:09:34.849 --> 04:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
that parents want for example I have
 
04:09:37.370 --> 04:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
down there in that fourth box
 
04:09:39.790 --> 04:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
considerations in tuitioning out
 
04:09:41.929 --> 04:09:41.939 align:start position:0%
academic programming I just mentioned
 
04:09:43.070 --> 04:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
some of that
 
04:09:45.229 --> 04:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
performance outcomes you look and see
 
04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
how the students come out of school
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
perform on the Statewide assessment
 
04:09:50.689 --> 04:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
that's done in multiple places in the
 
04:09:50.699 --> 04:09:51.950 align:start position:0%
that's done in multiple places in the
state

04:09:51.950 --> 04:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:09:54.349 --> 04:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
you look at graduation rates what's the
 
04:09:56.210 --> 04:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
graduation rate for students that are in
 
04:09:57.530 --> 04:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
your high school
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
special education services and other
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
related type services that we see
 
04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes in differentiated Aid
 
04:10:06.410 --> 04:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities that's a big
 
04:10:07.790 --> 04:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
one for parents when they're choosing
 
04:10:09.650 --> 04:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
where am I going to send my my student
 
04:10:11.450 --> 04:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
is there a wonderful theater program
 
04:10:13.610 --> 04:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
offered in that particular building in
 
04:10:15.710 --> 04:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
fact that's one of the choices that the
 
04:10:17.929 --> 04:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
kids in Piermont have they I've always
 
04:10:20.030 --> 04:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
heard for years that Oxbow has a
 
04:10:21.769 --> 04:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
wonderful theater program so does St
 
04:10:21.779 --> 04:10:23.290 align:start position:0%
wonderful theater program so does St
Johnsbury

04:10:23.290 --> 04:10:23.300 align:start position:0%
Johnsbury
 
04:10:26.030 --> 04:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
transportation is another issue
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
this this school district the sending
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
district is not required to provide
 
04:10:32.450 --> 04:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
transportation for high school students
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
but they do do this for the anchor or
 
04:10:36.170 --> 04:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
the school which provides all those
 
04:10:38.210 --> 04:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
Services especially where you have a
 
04:10:40.250 --> 04:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
special youngster that needs that type
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
of service
 
04:10:43.729 --> 04:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
and you look at the Career Technical
 
04:10:46.130 --> 04:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
education when looking at these
 
04:10:48.410 --> 04:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
receiving schools you also look to see
 
04:10:51.889 --> 04:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
if CTE embedded in that school of the
 
04:10:55.429 --> 04:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
fourth Piermont has to have embedded CTE
 
04:10:58.070 --> 04:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the program St Johnsbury Academy and
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
Oxbow which is where they have Riverbend
 
04:11:02.929 --> 04:11:02.939 align:start position:0%
which is the CTE Center which accepts
 
04:11:05.689 --> 04:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
all the CTE students from Orford right
 
04:11:08.510 --> 04:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
up through Lisbon New Hampshire so they
 
04:11:10.130 --> 04:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
all go to that school for the CTE
 
04:11:10.140 --> 04:11:11.689 align:start position:0%
all go to that school for the CTE
training

04:11:11.689 --> 04:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
training
 
04:11:13.550 --> 04:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
and you also look at the big one in the
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
bottom the tuition cost what is the
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
tuition cost
 
04:11:20.510 --> 04:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
so going back down so you see I put down
 
04:11:22.429 --> 04:11:22.439 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the sheet here there's a
 
04:11:24.050 --> 04:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
tuition cap you have
 
04:11:26.510 --> 04:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
a tuition cap of this the what the the
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
local district has done remember the
 
04:11:31.130 --> 04:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
school boards approved all these schools
 
04:11:33.229 --> 04:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
but they now have this cap in place as
 
04:11:38.210 --> 04:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
well you have school district a b c and
 
04:11:38.220 --> 04:11:39.229 align:start position:0%
well you have school district a b c and
d

04:11:39.229 --> 04:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
d
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
these aren't the exact number sometimes
 
04:11:42.650 --> 04:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
I just threw them in the other night
 
04:11:46.010 --> 04:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
although the one on D is correct
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
so you have a saying well you can come
 
04:11:50.689 --> 04:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
to our school for 18.5 thousand dollars
 
04:11:53.450 --> 04:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
that's within the cap
 
04:11:55.969 --> 04:11:55.979 align:start position:0%
B nineteen thousand one hundred dollars
 
04:11:58.490 --> 04:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
and C you can see that is equal to the
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
cap so they're still in the game
 
04:12:03.290 --> 04:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
but d as just in the last year increased
 
04:12:05.809 --> 04:12:05.819 align:start position:0%
the cap but there's always students from
 
04:12:08.450 --> 04:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
Piermont at that school
 
04:12:11.150 --> 04:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
now during the pandemic out of that
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
class I graduated from Paramount not
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
many kids you know four of them opted to
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
go one direction through St Johnsbury
 
04:12:20.090 --> 04:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
Academy but one then decided I'll go to
 
04:12:20.100 --> 04:12:21.290 align:start position:0%
Academy but one then decided I'll go to
Oxbow

04:12:21.290 --> 04:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
Oxbow
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
which was lesser but this is all done
 
04:12:28.250 --> 04:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
when covid was here with us all and the
 
04:12:29.689 --> 04:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
way they looked at these schools back
 
04:12:31.490 --> 04:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
then was online they didn't have an
 
04:12:32.929 --> 04:12:32.939 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get into buildings and
 
04:12:34.370 --> 04:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
see what is this school going to be like
 
04:12:37.010 --> 04:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
as eighth graders which they normally do
 
04:12:39.889 --> 04:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
but because of the covid they didn't get
 
04:12:41.450 --> 04:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
into these buildings three of them opted
 
04:12:46.429 --> 04:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:48.050 --> 04:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
one year later
 
04:12:51.050 --> 04:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
Saint J upstiani tuition rate's going to
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
jump over a thousand dollars above the
 
04:12:52.859 --> 04:12:54.229 align:start position:0%
jump over a thousand dollars above the
cap

04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
cap
 
04:12:56.570 --> 04:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
can that student that decided to go now
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
to Oxbow who has now decided this is
 
04:13:00.889 --> 04:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
where I don't want to be I want to be
 
04:13:03.110 --> 04:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
with the other classmates I came out of
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
eighth grade with up at St Johnsbury
 
04:13:04.800 --> 04:13:05.870 align:start position:0%
eighth grade with up at St Johnsbury
Academy

04:13:05.870 --> 04:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
Academy
 
04:13:08.269 --> 04:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
well it's below the cap now so you can't
 
04:13:08.279 --> 04:13:10.130 align:start position:0%
well it's below the cap now so you can't
attend

04:13:10.130 --> 04:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
attend
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
St Johnsbury takes kids from lime they
 
04:13:14.330 --> 04:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
take kids all the way up the river to
 
04:13:16.429 --> 04:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
and there's an article you have there
 
04:13:18.290 --> 04:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
which is put out by the Valley News just
 
04:13:19.729 --> 04:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
recently you can see well not recently
 
04:13:21.530 --> 04:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
in June
 
04:13:24.650 --> 04:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
and it says St Johnsbury Academy a
 
04:13:27.170 --> 04:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
private high school it's an independent
 
04:13:29.689 --> 04:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
private school because it does receive
 
04:13:32.150 --> 04:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
monies from uh various public schools
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
for tuition
 
04:13:35.210 --> 04:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
in St Johnsbury Vermont currently
 
04:13:37.309 --> 04:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
enrolls three or four of pyrmont
 
04:13:39.530 --> 04:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
students another Piermont student had
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
hoped to enroll this fall according to
 
04:13:44.330 --> 04:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
SAU superintendent
 
04:13:46.490 --> 04:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
since this article we were able to
 
04:13:47.929 --> 04:13:47.939 align:start position:0%
negotiate whether that's with the
 
04:13:50.150 --> 04:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
Headmaster of CJ and get permission for
 
04:13:52.729 --> 04:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
that child to attend but that's for the
 
04:13:54.410 --> 04:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
next year we don't know about the
 
04:13:55.550 --> 04:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
following years
 
04:13:58.490 --> 04:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
going on down tuition will increase to
 
04:13:59.929 --> 04:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand eight hundred fifty five
 
04:14:03.110 --> 04:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
dollars so that went over their cap so
 
04:14:04.610 --> 04:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
the question now for the Paramount board
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
are we going to allow the student to
 
04:14:06.000 --> 04:14:07.130 align:start position:0%
are we going to allow the student to
attend

04:14:07.130 --> 04:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
attend
 
04:14:09.229 --> 04:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
piermont's tuition formulas established
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
in District policy that board could only
 
04:14:13.610 --> 04:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
change through a formal policy revision
 
04:14:15.889 --> 04:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
process they went through to their
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
attorney and the attorney says well we
 
04:14:20.990 --> 04:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
advise you not to do that
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'll take another District I have landaf
 
04:14:27.050 --> 04:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
land app is a small k-3 and they after
 
04:14:28.849 --> 04:14:28.859 align:start position:0%
third grade they send all their kids to
 
04:14:28.859 --> 04:14:30.950 align:start position:0%
third grade they send all their kids to
Lisbon

04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
Lisbon
 
04:14:32.809 --> 04:14:32.819 align:start position:0%
this is there what you call might call
 
04:14:34.429 --> 04:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
an anchor school as they call it down
 
04:14:37.130 --> 04:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
Croydon because this scenario is all
 
04:14:42.349 --> 04:14:42.359 align:start position:0%
over our state with these kh3 k4sk sixes
 
04:14:45.170 --> 04:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
so what land staff does they send their
 
04:14:46.729 --> 04:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
kids they bus them in the land death
 
04:14:46.739 --> 04:14:48.410 align:start position:0%
kids they bus them in the land death
however

04:14:48.410 --> 04:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:14:51.469 --> 04:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
they also provide the ability for a
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
parent who so deems to have their kids
 
04:14:57.530 --> 04:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
go to a profile over in Franconia
 
04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
or over the mountain to St Johnsbury
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
Academy in in Vermont
 
04:15:04.969 --> 04:15:04.979 align:start position:0%
this school district there in land app
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
allows the parent to take their kids and
 
04:15:09.530 --> 04:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
they will pay the whole nine yards
 
04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's never been a question other
 
04:15:13.969 --> 04:15:13.979 align:start position:0%
districts allow the parents to pay the
 
04:15:13.979 --> 04:15:15.710 align:start position:0%
districts allow the parents to pay the
difference

04:15:15.710 --> 04:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:15:17.870 --> 04:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
and some are doing that in the state
 
04:15:19.370 --> 04:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:15:21.410 --> 04:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
so this is one of those issues in
 
04:15:23.330 --> 04:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
statute that
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
that has been quietly kept underneath
 
04:15:27.349 --> 04:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
the carpet because it's being done
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
differently everywhere you go
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
but now in this particular District I'm
 
04:15:34.670 --> 04:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
talking about in Paramount there's
 
04:15:36.410 --> 04:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
really question regarding it they're
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
saying other districts are doing it
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
why can't we have our parent pay that
 
04:15:43.490 --> 04:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
difference why can't we have our
 
04:15:45.530 --> 04:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
district pay our parent pay the one
 
04:15:47.570 --> 04:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars if they're able to or
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
why can't we have a pot of money set
 
04:15:52.910 --> 04:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
aside maybe it's from a non-profit of
 
04:15:54.950 --> 04:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
some time for the kid that can't afford
 
04:15:56.750 --> 04:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
that to do that
 
04:15:58.610 --> 04:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
remember the transportation is provided
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
to Oxbow the transportation is provided
 
04:16:02.689 --> 04:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
to Woodsville but not the St Johnsbury
 
04:16:05.689 --> 04:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
Academy which is a 40-minute ride up
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
interstate 93.
 
04:16:11.330 --> 04:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
so going on down in this one right I was
 
04:16:13.250 --> 04:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
reading about the Valley News the
 
04:16:15.290 --> 04:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
Paramount School Board Also may create
 
04:16:17.030 --> 04:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
tuition contracts with those schools
 
04:16:19.130 --> 04:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
which does public and private provide
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
provide the school's tuition rate Falls
 
04:16:23.090 --> 04:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
within piermont's funding cap which is
 
04:16:25.550 --> 04:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
set at the average of three receiving
 
04:16:28.010 --> 04:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
schools plus 18 that shows that
 
04:16:30.349 --> 04:16:30.359 align:start position:0%
piermont's tuition policy created seven
 
04:16:32.090 --> 04:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
years ago prohibited support from
 
04:16:35.330 --> 04:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
Contracting with School uh schools whose
 
04:16:38.929 --> 04:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
tuition exceeds the district's cap
 
04:16:41.389 --> 04:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
the policy does not permit the board at
 
04:16:43.130 --> 04:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
its discretion to exceed the tuition
 
04:16:45.290 --> 04:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
tuition limit for students who are
 
04:16:47.450 --> 04:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
enrolled prior to tuition hike I was
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
contacted by school board members there
 
04:16:51.530 --> 04:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
and say we're willing to do it if in
 
04:16:53.450 --> 04:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
fact we can have stats to raise uh
 
04:16:56.210 --> 04:16:56.220 align:start position:0%
language stating we can do that that's
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
what this bill does if you read the
 
04:17:00.110 --> 04:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
bottom line where it's been added I'll
 
04:17:01.849 --> 04:17:01.859 align:start position:0%
get to that in a second
 
04:17:03.710 --> 04:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
on the backside of the chief from Valley
 
04:17:05.929 --> 04:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
News which is gets all the news out of
 
04:17:08.630 --> 04:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
the Concord Monitor many New Hampshire
 
04:17:10.849 --> 04:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
districts which school choice including
 
04:17:12.830 --> 04:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
Croydon and Cornish will split the
 
04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
tuition burden with student family when
 
04:17:16.670 --> 04:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
a school exceeds the sending District's
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
maximum allowance so there's another way
 
04:17:20.150 --> 04:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
of doing it there too in these
 
04:17:21.889 --> 04:17:21.899 align:start position:0%
situations the sending district will pay
 
04:17:24.410 --> 04:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
the tuition up to its cap which is
 
04:17:25.849 --> 04:17:25.859 align:start position:0%
typically the tuition rate of the
 
04:17:27.229 --> 04:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
district's primary receiving school
 
04:17:29.330 --> 04:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
system the student's family is required
 
04:17:31.729 --> 04:17:31.739 align:start position:0%
to pay the remainder
 
04:17:33.710 --> 04:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
going on down further in this article
 
04:17:35.330 --> 04:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
this is all coming out of board meetings
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
which they've had the Piermont School
 
04:17:39.229 --> 04:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
Board explored changing its policy to
 
04:17:40.610 --> 04:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
allow families to pay the tuition
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
difference but attorneys consulted by
 
04:17:44.150 --> 04:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
the school district warned that changing
 
04:17:46.849 --> 04:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
the policy could result in District
 
04:17:49.130 --> 04:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
legally having to reimburse families who
 
04:17:51.950 --> 04:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
under the current policy had to pay the
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
full tuition to those same schools
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
so they're talking about back payment
 
04:17:59.150 --> 04:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
now if we go ahead with this so now
 
04:18:00.590 --> 04:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
they're saying to me
 
04:18:03.410 --> 04:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
get it in that state law so we are
 
04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
protected with state law
 
04:18:08.330 --> 04:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
while New Hampshire law does not
 
04:18:10.010 --> 04:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
prohibits districts from splitting the
 
04:18:12.769 --> 04:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
tuition costs with parents so long as
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
the district provides at least one fully
 
04:18:16.670 --> 04:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
funded education option which parent
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
does attorneys said that changing to a
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
policy at paying a tuition for families
 
04:18:23.809 --> 04:18:23.819 align:start position:0%
that the district previously denied to
 
04:18:25.729 --> 04:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
other families could raise legal
 
04:18:28.729 --> 04:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
questions about fairness and equality
 
04:18:31.070 --> 04:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
so here we are
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
and we have many different ways of doing
 
04:18:36.110 --> 04:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
this throughout the state we need some
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
guidance from the in statute oh we can
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
just keep it underneath the carpet and
 
04:18:41.450 --> 04:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
let these districts do what they want
 
04:18:42.290 --> 04:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
but then we're going to be
 
04:18:43.790 --> 04:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
discriminating it's the kids in one
 
04:18:45.290 --> 04:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
District of doing one week and a kid in
 
04:18:47.210 --> 04:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
another District doing another way
 
04:18:49.370 --> 04:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
it needs to be resolved
 
04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
and for these reasons I brought the bill
 
04:18:55.490 --> 04:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
forward and in reading the backside of
 
04:18:57.410 --> 04:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
that bill in reading it carefully in
 
04:19:00.889 --> 04:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
lines 9 through 12 12. to enroll a child
 
04:19:02.929 --> 04:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
in a tuition School approved by the
 
04:19:05.929 --> 04:19:05.939 align:start position:0%
local school board so this only applies
 
04:19:08.809 --> 04:19:08.819 align:start position:0%
for those receiving schools that have
 
04:19:10.610 --> 04:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
been approved
 
04:19:13.370 --> 04:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
by the local school board and by the way
 
04:19:15.290 --> 04:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
all four schools that I've talked about
 
04:19:17.570 --> 04:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
in Paramount are not just approved by
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
the local board they're approved by the
 
04:19:23.210 --> 04:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont and also approved by
 
04:19:25.250 --> 04:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire they all
 
04:19:27.889 --> 04:19:27.899 align:start position:0%
received letters from the commission of
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
education at Nabi Jenny Brown Jenny
 
04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
Perry which was here harassment was here
 
04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
earlier today she wrote a letter to all
 
04:19:39.469 --> 04:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
these schools saying yes it's I have the
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
authority to approve you seeing that you
 
04:19:42.769 --> 04:19:42.779 align:start position:0%
are approved in the neighboring state
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
because we have those Interstate
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
governmental agreements going on Whose
 
04:19:49.729 --> 04:19:49.739 align:start position:0%
tuition cost is above the district's
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
established tuition cost per pupil as
 
04:19:55.250 --> 04:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
determined and approved by the board the
 
04:19:58.010 --> 04:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
local board may require the parent to
 
04:20:00.650 --> 04:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
pay the tuition cost difference so this
 
04:20:00.660 --> 04:20:02.929 align:start position:0%
pay the tuition cost difference so this
allows

04:20:02.929 --> 04:20:02.939 align:start position:0%
allows
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
landaf to pay it because there's opting
 
04:20:07.729 --> 04:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
we're not going to require the parent to
 
04:20:10.250 --> 04:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
do it we're going to do it Paramount may
 
04:20:12.410 --> 04:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
require or some other District may
 
04:20:12.420 --> 04:20:13.610 align:start position:0%
require or some other District may
require

04:20:13.610 --> 04:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
require
 
04:20:15.530 --> 04:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
the parent to pay that difference
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
because they are providing District to
 
04:20:19.849 --> 04:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
the Anchor School
 
04:20:22.370 --> 04:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
so I'll close in stating that I don't
 
04:20:25.429 --> 04:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
have a list of all the k-8s in the state
 
04:20:27.170 --> 04:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of them there's a
 
04:20:30.170 --> 04:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
lot of k6s we have some k4s
 
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
and and a K3
 
04:20:35.689 --> 04:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
and do students go to another location
 
04:20:37.849 --> 04:20:37.859 align:start position:0%
for the upper levels of Education that
 
04:20:39.769 --> 04:20:39.779 align:start position:0%
they don't provide
 
04:20:41.570 --> 04:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
but they're all done according to a
 
04:20:43.969 --> 04:20:43.979 align:start position:0%
local policy and but the the thing
 
04:20:45.050 --> 04:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
that's happening is we're having
 
04:20:47.330 --> 04:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
attorneys getting into the game and
 
04:20:49.130 --> 04:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
giving different signals in different
 
04:20:51.290 --> 04:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
directions to haul these and that's
 
04:20:53.210 --> 04:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
making it difficult for those who would
 
04:20:54.769 --> 04:20:54.779 align:start position:0%
like to do something but they're hearing
 
04:20:56.630 --> 04:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
maybe from an attorney he can't do it
 
04:20:58.729 --> 04:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
well that's just an opinion
 
04:21:01.490 --> 04:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
so we need statutory law to help us sort
 
04:21:03.650 --> 04:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
this out thank you very much
 
04:21:06.469 --> 04:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions uh
 
04:21:09.469 --> 04:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
04:21:10.969 --> 04:21:10.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and thank you
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you for taking my
 
04:21:12.479 --> 04:21:15.170 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you for taking my
question

04:21:15.170 --> 04:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:19.370 --> 04:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you could comment on
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
how we might approach a concern that I
 
04:21:21.840 --> 04:21:23.269 align:start position:0%
how we might approach a concern that I
have

04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
which is that a school board might
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
choose as their
 
04:21:31.729 --> 04:21:31.739 align:start position:0%
funding cap
 
04:21:34.790 --> 04:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
a tuition amount that is not adequate
 
04:21:38.269 --> 04:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
for the local public school
 
04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
and I can offer for instance if that's
 
04:21:42.650 --> 04:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
helpful to detail
 
04:21:45.110 --> 04:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah okay they did not do that they
 
04:21:47.150 --> 04:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
didn't do it but they didn't yeah very
 
04:21:50.450 --> 04:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
vulnerable so yeah we tuition to a
 
04:21:53.630 --> 04:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
Montessori school public schools and
 
04:21:55.250 --> 04:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
Mount Royal Academy which is a Catholic
 
04:21:55.260 --> 04:21:56.090 align:start position:0%
Mount Royal Academy which is a Catholic
School

04:21:56.090 --> 04:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
School
 
04:21:58.250 --> 04:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
for fifth grade and up some of those
 
04:21:59.870 --> 04:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
schools do five through eight some you
 
04:22:01.309 --> 04:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
know five to twelve
 
04:22:03.650 --> 04:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
the Montessori school and Mount Royal
 
04:22:06.769 --> 04:22:06.779 align:start position:0%
are half the cost or less of the public
 
04:22:10.130 --> 04:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:12.530 --> 04:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
I read this bill a school board and
 
04:22:14.150 --> 04:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong
 
04:22:16.250 --> 04:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
a school board can choose a tuition cap
 
04:22:19.010 --> 04:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
that would not adequately fund
 
04:22:20.689 --> 04:22:20.699 align:start position:0%
students going to public school and
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
parents could be paying 50 percent of
 
04:22:25.010 --> 04:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
the public school tuition the the school
 
04:22:27.010 --> 04:22:27.020 align:start position:0%
descending District you're talking about
 
04:22:30.349 --> 04:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
has the responsibility to ensure that
 
04:22:32.269 --> 04:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
all students provide are providing the
 
04:22:33.889 --> 04:22:33.899 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
04:22:35.570 --> 04:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
that that adequate education has
 
04:22:37.729 --> 04:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
delivered if they can't deliver that
 
04:22:39.469 --> 04:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
education internally within the grades
 
04:22:41.269 --> 04:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
they have they are responsible for
 
04:22:44.150 --> 04:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
providing that in a receiving School
 
04:22:47.630 --> 04:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
and they have to do that now they also
 
04:22:49.969 --> 04:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
have to have what we call an anchor
 
04:22:51.710 --> 04:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
school is not in the law but they have
 
04:22:53.450 --> 04:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
to have a where you don't twist it at
 
04:22:55.790 --> 04:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
school that's going to provide all those
 
04:22:58.130 --> 04:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
Services when they identify that school
 
04:23:01.010 --> 04:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a tuition per pupil
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
cost that may be their cap or it may be
 
04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
some other number that they figured but
 
04:23:08.570 --> 04:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to be equal to or
 
04:23:10.849 --> 04:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
better than because they are obligated
 
04:23:13.130 --> 04:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
to provide this service they have to
 
04:23:15.050 --> 04:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
have an agreement to take care of those
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
students and I don't believe what
 
04:23:18.889 --> 04:23:18.899 align:start position:0%
Croydon was going to say well you can
 
04:23:21.469 --> 04:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
all do it online that is not what we
 
04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's not the proper delivery of any
 
04:23:26.750 --> 04:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
education what we want to do is we want
 
04:23:29.630 --> 04:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
to have if you're back here when the
 
04:23:31.130 --> 04:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
days of Jenny Berry was here we were
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
talking about competencies
 
04:23:34.729 --> 04:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
and different students have different
 
04:23:36.170 --> 04:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
areas that they want to be really
 
04:23:38.450 --> 04:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
competent in so that's why we have this
 
04:23:40.550 --> 04:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
program where you pick a couple because
 
04:23:42.650 --> 04:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
if you want to be really competent in
 
04:23:45.189 --> 04:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
CTE probably go to Oxbow Academy
 
04:23:48.410 --> 04:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
Oxbow which is CTE school or if you want
 
04:23:50.570 --> 04:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
to have Robotics and Sciences and the
 
04:23:52.969 --> 04:23:52.979 align:start position:0%
foreign languages all maybe Saint Jay
 
04:23:54.229 --> 04:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
but you're not going to get the
 
04:23:56.150 --> 04:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
transportation to go to Saint Jay as you
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
would get the transportation to go to
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
Oxbow Rivendell if you really want to be
 
04:24:02.929 --> 04:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
in a powerful Athletic program go to
 
04:24:05.870 --> 04:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
Rivendell everybody has every school has
 
04:24:07.610 --> 04:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
surpluses and that's what attracts
 
04:24:09.889 --> 04:24:09.899 align:start position:0%
there's competency levels at it's the
 
04:24:11.929 --> 04:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
best fit it's best fit so to answer your
 
04:24:13.370 --> 04:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
question I hope I did that they're going
 
04:24:15.349 --> 04:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
to have to provide at least the dollar
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
amount in the cap that the school that
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
they're sending the kids to to continue
 
04:24:21.950 --> 04:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
grades four five and six and on up to
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
12. they're going to have to provide
 
04:24:28.370 --> 04:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
that school's tuition rate as their cap
 
04:24:30.889 --> 04:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
if they only want to cap one and then
 
04:24:32.389 --> 04:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
they may find somebody else to lower
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
your cap and they could do that as well
 
04:24:37.670 --> 04:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
if they provide all the services that
 
04:24:39.229 --> 04:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
are necessary
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative Miler thank you Mr
 
04:24:45.359 --> 04:24:46.370 align:start position:0%
uh representative Miler thank you Mr
chair

04:24:46.370 --> 04:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:24:50.269 --> 04:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
excuse me but I'm a little confused
 
04:24:53.809 --> 04:24:53.819 align:start position:0%
see if I see if I got this right
 
04:24:55.790 --> 04:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about school districts
 
04:24:58.790 --> 04:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
that need to send their children outside
 
04:25:00.530 --> 04:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
their District because they don't have
 
04:25:03.530 --> 04:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:03.540 --> 04:25:04.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:25:04.389 --> 04:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:07.070 --> 04:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that the school
 
04:25:09.110 --> 04:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
district would establish an anchor
 
04:25:11.630 --> 04:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
school to use your term
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
and that anchor School let's say is
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars a year
 
04:25:18.530 --> 04:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
and that's the tuition that that school
 
04:25:21.889 --> 04:25:21.899 align:start position:0%
district has with that anchor School
 
04:25:23.689 --> 04:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
04:25:27.290 --> 04:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
if I as a parent in that school district
 
04:25:30.110 --> 04:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
if I want to send my child
 
04:25:33.769 --> 04:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
to another school district because of
 
04:25:35.389 --> 04:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
whatever the specialty you're talking
 
04:25:37.849 --> 04:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
about that I want them to go to and that
 
04:25:40.429 --> 04:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
tuition for that school district is
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
twenty three thousand dollars
 
04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
this bill will then say well you can go
 
04:25:47.149 --> 04:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to provide the money to go
 
04:25:48.889 --> 04:25:48.899 align:start position:0%
to this anchor School
 
04:25:52.130 --> 04:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
but parent if you want to go to school B
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
at 23 then you can pay the additional
 
04:25:58.250 --> 04:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars is is that what
 
04:26:01.250 --> 04:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
we're saying here no okay no because
 
04:26:03.530 --> 04:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
that the the school that the parent
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
wants that child to go is twenty three
 
04:26:07.250 --> 04:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
thousand but if that school receiving
 
04:26:09.830 --> 04:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
school is not approved by the sending
 
04:26:12.729 --> 04:26:12.739 align:start position:0%
board then it's it's out of the equation
 
04:26:15.830 --> 04:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
so what we have is if you have these
 
04:26:17.570 --> 04:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
three schools right here four schools
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
piermont's approved all those as
 
04:26:23.149 --> 04:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
receiving schools and and so at this
 
04:26:25.790 --> 04:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
point in time you could but one of them
 
04:26:29.269 --> 04:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
now has gone over that cap and this is
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
going to happen more frequently as the
 
04:26:32.689 --> 04:26:32.699 align:start position:0%
cost of doing business are going to
 
04:26:32.699 --> 04:26:33.649 align:start position:0%
cost of doing business are going to
increase

04:26:33.649 --> 04:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh so um so then you could have you
 
04:26:38.990 --> 04:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
could say yes I would like my my son or
 
04:26:41.090 --> 04:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
daughter to go to St Johnsbury Academy I
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
will pay that additional twelve hundred
 
04:26:45.590 --> 04:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
dollars whatever it might be well excuse
 
04:26:47.630 --> 04:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
me if I may yes
 
04:26:50.149 --> 04:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
so if I've if the school district
 
04:26:52.370 --> 04:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
approves three different districts three
 
04:26:55.269 --> 04:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
different School options right
 
04:26:58.729 --> 04:26:58.739 align:start position:0%
I'm still confused about why wouldn't
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
the school district then
 
04:27:03.110 --> 04:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the one that went above
 
04:27:04.670 --> 04:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
what they wanted in the tuition why
 
04:27:06.950 --> 04:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they negotiate a different rate
 
04:27:10.010 --> 04:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
at that point in time my concern is is
 
04:27:13.790 --> 04:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
the parent having to spend extra money
 
04:27:15.790 --> 04:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
beyond what
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer budget is within that
 
04:27:21.410 --> 04:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
school district that's my concern Rick I
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
I see what you have representative Miler
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
is that they've also they've taken the
 
04:27:27.229 --> 04:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
average those three schools but they've
 
04:27:29.769 --> 04:27:29.779 align:start position:0%
also added in the fudge factor of 18
 
04:27:32.269 --> 04:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
which takes care of what they thought at
 
04:27:34.370 --> 04:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
that time would be the cost for
 
04:27:36.769 --> 04:27:36.779 align:start position:0%
tuitioning out to all these schools with
 
04:27:38.689 --> 04:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
what the cost of business going on right
 
04:27:40.849 --> 04:27:40.859 align:start position:0%
now in inflation Etc at the cost for
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
tuition are higher and so we have now
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
one school out there which is now above
 
04:27:50.510 --> 04:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
the the 18 on 18 of the average cost for
 
04:27:54.050 --> 04:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
those three schools which has gone uh on
 
04:27:56.269 --> 04:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
top of the the nineteen thousand plus
 
04:27:56.279 --> 04:27:57.410 align:start position:0%
top of the the nineteen thousand plus
dollars

04:27:57.410 --> 04:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:27:57.420 --> 04:27:59.590 align:start position:0%
dollars
so

04:27:59.590 --> 04:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's how that formula works but they
 
04:28:05.210 --> 04:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
all don't have formulas like that
 
04:28:07.610 --> 04:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
they some don't have formulas they just
 
04:28:09.290 --> 04:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
pick here's our cap number and this is
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
what we're going to allow you to and
 
04:28:13.370 --> 04:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
here's the schools we approve you can go
 
04:28:15.170 --> 04:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
to those approved schools
 
04:28:22.130 --> 04:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:24.889 --> 04:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
thank you would you consider adding to
 
04:28:26.570 --> 04:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:28:28.189 --> 04:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
um kind of what you were talking about
 
04:28:32.809 --> 04:28:32.819 align:start position:0%
to give to make every school district
 
04:28:36.290 --> 04:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh that actually only goes to a certain
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
level and has to tuition out their
 
04:28:37.680 --> 04:28:38.929 align:start position:0%
level and has to tuition out their
student

04:28:38.929 --> 04:28:38.939 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:28:41.389 --> 04:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
to have one
 
04:28:45.590 --> 04:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
option that was an anchor Public School
 
04:28:47.630 --> 04:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
of which
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
the sending School District would pay
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
full tuition
 
04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
would you you're looking at the issue I
 
04:28:56.090 --> 04:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
think with uh Newport and Sunapee and
 
04:28:57.170 --> 04:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
some of the others down there where
 
04:29:01.250 --> 04:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
Newport was that anchor yes you had I
 
04:29:02.689 --> 04:29:02.699 align:start position:0%
believe Sunapee was saying we're going
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
to take this student this student but
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
not that student
 
04:29:10.910 --> 04:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
04:29:12.889 --> 04:29:12.899 align:start position:0%
I just go back to statute where the
 
04:29:14.570 --> 04:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
statute requires the school district to
 
04:29:16.429 --> 04:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
provide an education for every child and
 
04:29:19.370 --> 04:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
every every grade level with the way we
 
04:29:22.429 --> 04:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
prescribe just as a follow-up to that
 
04:29:26.210 --> 04:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
um you know our commitment as a state as
 
04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
a taxpayer as a person in the state is
 
04:29:31.729 --> 04:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
to provide a public school system
 
04:29:34.130 --> 04:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
that's free
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
to the children in the state of New
 
04:29:37.199 --> 04:29:38.229 align:start position:0%
to the children in the state of New
Hampshire

04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
and to me it was just
 
04:29:45.950 --> 04:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
a terrible a terrible thing when when
 
04:29:48.889 --> 04:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
Croydon actually set their cap on their
 
04:29:48.899 --> 04:29:49.969 align:start position:0%
Croydon actually set their cap on their
tuition

04:29:49.969 --> 04:29:49.979 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
04:29:51.410 --> 04:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:29:53.929 --> 04:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
there were families in that town that
 
04:29:53.939 --> 04:29:54.889 align:start position:0%
there were families in that town that
had

04:29:54.889 --> 04:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:29:57.530 --> 04:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
three well one boy spoke he was a junior
 
04:29:59.809 --> 04:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
at Newport High School they had been
 
04:30:01.969 --> 04:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
paying for his tuition
 
04:30:04.969 --> 04:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
he'd been there since fourth grade he
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
played on the football team he was in a
 
04:30:10.729 --> 04:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
CTE welcome program he loved it he liked
 
04:30:13.070 --> 04:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
his teachers and now because they set
 
04:30:15.170 --> 04:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
that cap
 
04:30:17.630 --> 04:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
and it blocked out that public school it
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
blocked out a public school option his
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
family would have had to pay five
 
04:30:24.290 --> 04:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars over and above the
 
04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
tuition over and above what Croydon was
 
04:30:27.950 --> 04:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
willing to pay
 
04:30:30.050 --> 04:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that's the exact figure but
 
04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
let's say it is and that he had two
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
younger sisters who also wanted to go to
 
04:30:38.090 --> 04:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
Newport or were going to Newport so that
 
04:30:40.010 --> 04:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
particular family would have had to
 
04:30:41.809 --> 04:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
Shell out fifteen thousand dollars of
 
04:30:43.370 --> 04:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
their own money
 
04:30:47.149 --> 04:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
to go to the only Public School option
 
04:30:49.189 --> 04:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
of that particular School District
 
04:30:52.910 --> 04:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's why I asked you if you would
 
04:30:56.210 --> 04:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
consider an amendment to this bill that
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
says that this whatever they took
 
04:31:00.710 --> 04:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
whoever they tuition out they have one
 
04:31:03.469 --> 04:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
acre school that's a public school a
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
nearby public school or whatever public
 
04:31:08.050 --> 04:31:08.060 align:start position:0%
school can be in Vermont for that matter
 
04:31:10.610 --> 04:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
that that school district will end up
 
04:31:12.349 --> 04:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
paying full tuition
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
and then whatever they do beyond that
 
04:31:16.250 --> 04:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
would be fine
 
04:31:18.969 --> 04:31:18.979 align:start position:0%
um but I I support that concept 100
 
04:31:22.490 --> 04:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
there should be the availability of a
 
04:31:24.830 --> 04:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
student to go to a public school all the
 
04:31:29.269 --> 04:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
way through 12th grade at no cost uh now
 
04:31:31.849 --> 04:31:31.859 align:start position:0%
there are some that say well I want this
 
04:31:34.370 --> 04:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
other choice because there is a program
 
04:31:38.090 --> 04:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
up here in mathematics that it it can't
 
04:31:40.969 --> 04:31:40.979 align:start position:0%
be is not offered you know beyond the AP
 
04:31:43.370 --> 04:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
some higher level which some schools may
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
be doing that's that's that's a
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
different game we're providing at the
 
04:31:49.189 --> 04:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
schools you're talking about all the way
 
04:31:51.769 --> 04:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
through 12th grade all the requirements
 
04:31:56.090 --> 04:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
of 8306 and everything that's in 193e
 
04:31:58.969 --> 04:31:58.979 align:start position:0%
it's available at no cost I support that
 
04:32:00.530 --> 04:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
and I have no problem with the members
 
04:32:03.290 --> 04:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
of that sort okay
 
04:32:05.269 --> 04:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
04:32:07.790 --> 04:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
would you also consider an amendment
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
that would add the language that you
 
04:32:15.290 --> 04:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
used when you were describing
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
um piermont's approval of the different
 
04:32:20.149 --> 04:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
schools they would tuition to you noted
 
04:32:21.530 --> 04:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
that not only does the school board
 
04:32:25.790 --> 04:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
approve the schools they also I wrote in
 
04:32:27.769 --> 04:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
quotes here and approved by the state of
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
and the reason I'm asking that is I
 
04:32:34.610 --> 04:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
think probably most of us would agree
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
that compositions and values of school
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
boards vary and change over time
 
04:32:41.570 --> 04:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be good for the
 
04:32:44.149 --> 04:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
statute to state that the schools that
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
are tuitioned to are approved by the
 
04:32:50.269 --> 04:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
state for a perhaps broader look than
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
what some school boards might utilize we
 
04:32:55.790 --> 04:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
we have language already in statute
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
which has been there for
 
04:33:00.170 --> 04:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
at least four or five years when we talk
 
04:33:03.050 --> 04:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
about tuition schools and it's
 
04:33:05.330 --> 04:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
specifically written approved by the
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
local board and there are certain
 
04:33:09.289 --> 04:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
conditions and criteria which they must
 
04:33:13.209 --> 04:33:13.219 align:start position:0%
meet however if in fact you you
 
04:33:15.410 --> 04:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
addressed an amendment the way that
 
04:33:17.330 --> 04:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner is suggesting that
 
04:33:21.769 --> 04:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
there be one K through 12 Pre-K whatever
 
04:33:23.390 --> 04:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
you want to call it all the way up to 12
 
04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
with a public school that meets 306 and
 
04:33:28.369 --> 04:33:28.379 align:start position:0%
the statutes
 
04:33:31.070 --> 04:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
and those schools are all approved by
 
04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
our Department of Education some of the
 
04:33:35.810 --> 04:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
schools that we're talking about aren't
 
04:33:37.510 --> 04:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
approved by our Department of Education
 
04:33:40.551 --> 04:33:40.561 align:start position:0%
they're approved by Department of
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
Education in Montpellier
 
04:33:45.890 --> 04:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
and or in in Augusta with Freiburg
 
04:33:49.010 --> 04:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
Academy and so and we have the mutual
 
04:33:50.810 --> 04:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
agreement with those two states only
 
04:33:52.730 --> 04:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
those two states and that agreement was
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
done by not us and the state it was done
 
04:33:57.230 --> 04:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
by the Congress of the United States
 
04:33:58.970 --> 04:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
we're getting into that type of language
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
inner governmental School agreements
 
04:34:04.250 --> 04:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts
 
04:34:07.369 --> 04:34:07.379 align:start position:0%
and so I I think that I think we have
 
04:34:09.410 --> 04:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
really had this thing covered that you
 
04:34:10.670 --> 04:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
know they're going to be going to an
 
04:34:12.529 --> 04:34:12.539 align:start position:0%
approved school by the Department of
 
04:34:14.510 --> 04:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
Education the State Board of Education
 
04:34:16.970 --> 04:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that
 
04:34:19.369 --> 04:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
by inclusive of language that represent
 
04:34:23.709 --> 04:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:27.609 --> 04:34:27.619 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thanks um
 
04:34:30.349 --> 04:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
so we understand this
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
the intent of this the intent of the
 
04:34:35.890 --> 04:34:35.900 align:start position:0%
bill is to give local school districts
 
04:34:39.470 --> 04:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh legislative RSA approval
 
04:34:42.890 --> 04:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
so that so that it doesn't fall back on
 
04:34:44.330 --> 04:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
them if something hits the fan legally
 
04:34:46.070 --> 04:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
04:34:49.010 --> 04:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
um but as it now stands in your your
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
bold part on this bill local school
 
04:34:53.810 --> 04:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
districts except the new palliative
 
04:34:57.051 --> 04:34:57.061 align:start position:0%
local school districts could themselves
 
04:34:59.869 --> 04:34:59.879 align:start position:0%
do this but this is more of a a cover
 
04:35:02.449 --> 04:35:02.459 align:start position:0%
blanket for them that's exactly right
 
04:35:05.449 --> 04:35:05.459 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you Mr Cornell
 
04:35:08.090 --> 04:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
any further questions see none thank you
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
next will be uh representative Matt
 
04:35:14.400 --> 04:35:27.590 align:start position:0%
next will be uh representative Matt
Cullen

04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:29.750 --> 04:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you to
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
everyone uh on the board for your uh
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
attention today
 
04:35:37.609 --> 04:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna read a testimony I
 
04:35:42.170 --> 04:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
represent uh craft in five HB 275
 
04:35:45.230 --> 04:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
provides much needed clarification on an
 
04:35:47.631 --> 04:35:47.641 align:start position:0%
issue important to my constituents in
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
Piermont New Hampshire
 
04:35:52.131 --> 04:35:52.141 align:start position:0%
Paramount has no high school there for
 
04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
students residing there have
 
04:35:55.730 --> 04:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
historically had the ability to choose
 
04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
which surrounding schools they'd like to
 
04:35:57.840 --> 04:35:58.970 align:start position:0%
which surrounding schools they'd like to
attend

04:35:58.970 --> 04:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
attend
 
04:36:02.570 --> 04:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
however after a tuition cap was set in
 
04:36:05.330 --> 04:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
the early 2000s students and Piermont
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
saw their High School choices begin to
 
04:36:10.250 --> 04:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
plummet as prices began to Eclipse their
 
04:36:10.260 --> 04:36:11.330 align:start position:0%
plummet as prices began to Eclipse their
cap

04:36:11.330 --> 04:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
cap
 
04:36:13.609 --> 04:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
even though surrounding towns policies
 
04:36:16.250 --> 04:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
allow a parent to pay a tuition overage
 
04:36:20.449 --> 04:36:20.459 align:start position:0%
as HB 275 would solidify the Paramount
 
04:36:23.330 --> 04:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
school board and SAU 23 superintendent
 
04:36:25.609 --> 04:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
have claimed that it violates New
 
04:36:28.250 --> 04:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law I've heard firsthand from
 
04:36:30.051 --> 04:36:30.061 align:start position:0%
parents in Paramount who feel
 
04:36:32.631 --> 04:36:32.641 align:start position:0%
intimidated and obstructed by the
 
04:36:35.869 --> 04:36:35.879 align:start position:0%
actions of SAU 23 wanting only the
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
option to pay the difference in tuition
 
04:36:41.029 --> 04:36:41.039 align:start position:0%
for the education which Best Suits their
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
students HB 275 would establish
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
statutory language which supports
 
04:36:50.570 --> 04:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
harmonious local customs and it's in
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
this interest that I ask you to consider
 
04:36:57.410 --> 04:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
voting OTP and uh I'm open to any
 
04:36:59.689 --> 04:36:59.699 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative

it was
 
04:37:12.109 --> 04:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
was there anywhere else who wanted to
 
04:37:14.990 --> 04:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
speak on HB 275
 
04:37:19.070 --> 04:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
see none of close the hearing and in a

according to the New Hampshire

Department of Labor issues related to
 
04:39:04.970 --> 04:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
workers compensation claims have changed
 
04:39:07.310 --> 04:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
drastically over the years the
 
04:39:09.230 --> 04:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor in New Hampshire has
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
a small Division of Vocational

workers compensation cases
 
04:39:17.510 --> 04:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
for reference the administrative rule
 
04:39:19.150 --> 04:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
can be found in section
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
281-a colon 25 for this program
 
04:39:25.369 --> 04:39:25.379 align:start position:0%
due to the internal work that happens
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
within the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:39:29.631 --> 04:39:29.641 align:start position:0%
Labor this statute language for the
 
04:39:31.310 --> 04:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
state vocational rehabilitation program
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
is no longer needed hence the request to
 
04:39:36.709 --> 04:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
repeal this section and I might add that
 
04:39:39.170 --> 04:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
this bill is submitted on behalf of the
 
04:39:41.208 --> 04:39:41.218 align:start position:0%
Department of Education thank you very
 
04:39:43.070 --> 04:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
much are there questions for
 
04:39:45.530 --> 04:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
04:39:48.050 --> 04:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
another first today move
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
um I had trouble wrapping my head around
 
04:39:55.610 --> 04:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
this one and it had to do with
 
04:39:58.150 --> 04:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
um why it was relevant to education
 
04:40:00.530 --> 04:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's the point of the repeal
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
but can you answer that or is that a
 
04:40:05.330 --> 04:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
question better asked of doe I had
 
04:40:07.130 --> 04:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
exactly the same concerns and I think
 
04:40:08.630 --> 04:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's why the Department of Education
 
04:40:12.170 --> 04:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
is here to take over thank you good
 
04:40:12.180 --> 04:40:13.730 align:start position:0%
is here to take over thank you good

04:40:13.730 --> 04:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
response
 
04:40:16.190 --> 04:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:40:17.690 --> 04:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:40:21.170 --> 04:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:21.180 --> 04:40:24.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Lisa Henson hatz I'm
 
04:40:29.390 --> 04:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
The Vocational Rehabilitation director
 
04:40:31.730 --> 04:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to thank representative
 
04:40:34.010 --> 04:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
pedernal and representative Vlad and the
 
04:40:37.250 --> 04:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
committee for this opportunity that's a
 
04:40:39.070 --> 04:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
great question representative Noble
 
04:40:41.630 --> 04:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
Vocational Rehabilitation has
 
04:40:43.430 --> 04:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
traditionally been within the Department
 
04:40:46.550 --> 04:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
of Education in New Hampshire it's in
 
04:40:47.930 --> 04:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
all different places and different
 
04:40:50.868 --> 04:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
states we feel that we're in a great
 
04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
place because of our strong connection
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
to students with disabilities we have in
 
04:40:59.630 --> 04:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
fact 15 percent of our federal budget is
 
04:41:01.690 --> 04:41:01.700 align:start position:0%
set aside specifically to work with
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
students students with disabilities who
 
04:41:07.130 --> 04:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
are eligible for our program or
 
04:41:09.530 --> 04:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
potentially eligible meaning there's
 
04:41:10.970 --> 04:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
some thought that they might have a
 
04:41:13.130 --> 04:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
learning disability or something and and
 
04:41:15.430 --> 04:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
need our help so
 
04:41:18.410 --> 04:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
the reason that this you know that I see
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
that we're in the department of Ed makes
 
04:41:22.430 --> 04:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense and we get that question
 
04:41:26.030 --> 04:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
a lot so no worries
 
04:41:26.040 --> 04:41:27.230 align:start position:0%
a lot so no worries
um

04:41:27.230 --> 04:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:30.110 --> 04:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
so I did want to just um say for the
 
04:41:31.550 --> 04:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
record that
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
um we did a bunch of review of our
 
04:41:37.550 --> 04:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
Statute in 2021 and this was a section
 
04:41:39.708 --> 04:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
that we simply missed
 
04:41:42.890 --> 04:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
um and so we're we're coming back to to
 
04:41:46.490 --> 04:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
do this final repeal for this section
 
04:41:48.530 --> 04:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
um I've been with the department and
 
04:41:50.810 --> 04:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
with the Bureau of Oak rehab for 20
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
years and this particular section has
 
04:41:56.510 --> 04:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
never been actually utilized
 
04:41:58.850 --> 04:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
um so when someone has received some
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
kind of workers comp settlement
 
04:42:04.970 --> 04:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
um this this uh recovery of costs for
 
04:42:06.410 --> 04:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
any Services they may have already
 
04:42:08.690 --> 04:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
received by Vocational Rehabilitation
 
04:42:10.868 --> 04:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
just hasn't happened
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
and you know just a little bit of
 
04:42:16.788 --> 04:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
background on VR at any given time we
 
04:42:20.690 --> 04:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
have approximately 2 600 customers over
 
04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
50 percent of those customers are
 
04:42:25.250 --> 04:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
individuals on Social Security benefits
 
04:42:27.770 --> 04:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about folks with not a
 
04:42:30.350 --> 04:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
lot of resources to begin with it's the
 
04:42:32.570 --> 04:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's very common in our
 
04:42:32.580 --> 04:42:33.948 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's very common in our
customers

04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:42:36.890 --> 04:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
um you know we rarely see a workers comp
 
04:42:39.650 --> 04:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
case is what I would say so um and then
 
04:42:42.288 --> 04:42:42.298 align:start position:0%
in addition to that I did share the
 
04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor's information just
 
04:42:46.930 --> 04:42:46.940 align:start position:0%
to share that we do have a separate
 
04:42:50.510 --> 04:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
system and section for this within the
 
04:42:51.770 --> 04:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor here in New
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if I could take any
 
04:42:57.110 --> 04:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be available if I I have
 
04:42:59.868 --> 04:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
one question we oftentimes talk students
 
04:43:02.208 --> 04:43:02.218 align:start position:0%
pupils I hear the word customers what is
 
04:43:04.250 --> 04:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
what's meant by customer yes so
 
04:43:06.650 --> 04:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
Vocational Rehabilitation is happy to
 
04:43:08.810 --> 04:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
have two customers so our first customer
 
04:43:11.030 --> 04:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
is our individuals with disabilities
 
04:43:14.090 --> 04:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
which could be a student or an adult and
 
04:43:16.250 --> 04:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
then our second customer are our
 
04:43:18.530 --> 04:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
business partners because without them
 
04:43:20.090 --> 04:43:20.100 align:start position:0%
it's really hard for us to help people
 
04:43:22.368 --> 04:43:22.378 align:start position:0%
with disabilities obtain and maintain
 
04:43:24.650 --> 04:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
employment and their chosen career field
 
04:43:26.990 --> 04:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
so we use customers we also use
 
04:43:29.448 --> 04:43:29.458 align:start position:0%
participants because we want really want
 
04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're they're
 
04:43:33.190 --> 04:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
actively participating in their services
 
04:43:36.770 --> 04:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions from the
 
04:43:39.170 --> 04:43:39.180 align:start position:0%

04:43:48.770 --> 04:43:48.780 align:start position:0%

of providing public education or
 
04:44:34.190 --> 04:44:34.200 align:start position:0%

04:45:00.110 --> 04:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
one of the places that um doesn't have
 
04:45:02.690 --> 04:45:02.700 align:start position:0%
those background checks right now are
 
04:45:05.110 --> 04:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
the ones where students are going out on
 
04:45:07.850 --> 04:45:07.860 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere Extended Learning
 
04:45:11.628 --> 04:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
opportunities and also with the um
 
04:45:13.128 --> 04:45:13.138 align:start position:0%
the scholarships the tax credit
 
04:45:15.708 --> 04:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
scholarships or the efas
 
04:45:15.718 --> 04:45:17.208 align:start position:0%
scholarships or the efas
and

04:45:17.208 --> 04:45:17.218 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
um we can I think it's a dangerous
 
04:45:20.638 --> 04:45:21.350 align:start position:0%
um we can I think it's a dangerous
um

04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:24.110 --> 04:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
spot to be in where we're exposing
 
04:45:26.530 --> 04:45:26.540 align:start position:0%
children to people who have not
 
04:45:30.288 --> 04:45:30.298 align:start position:0%
undergone the background checks that we
 
04:45:33.170 --> 04:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
have now in place for educators
 
04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill extends the that background
 
04:45:36.000 --> 04:45:36.948 align:start position:0%
so this bill extends the that background
check

04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
check
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
um to all those areas and in most cases
 
04:45:44.510 --> 04:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
like um people will say well they they
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
do do background checks and they may
 
04:45:48.830 --> 04:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
even do fingerprint background checks
 
04:45:52.490 --> 04:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
but if you look at our laws and we've
 
04:45:54.770 --> 04:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
worked on them a lot the background
 
04:45:57.890 --> 04:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
checks that Educators have
 
04:46:01.330 --> 04:46:01.340 align:start position:0%
um have included about 20 different
 
04:46:03.470 --> 04:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
crimes for those criminal background
 
04:46:07.190 --> 04:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
checks that are particularly tagged in
 
04:46:08.868 --> 04:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
the cases of people that work with
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
children in an educational setting
 
04:46:15.890 --> 04:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
so this covers most contracted services
 
04:46:19.070 --> 04:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
and or contracted services in non-public
 
04:46:21.708 --> 04:46:21.718 align:start position:0%
schools and most contracted services in
 
04:46:24.410 --> 04:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
non-public schools do do background
 
04:46:26.510 --> 04:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
checks I mean it's risk management for
 
04:46:29.448 --> 04:46:29.458 align:start position:0%
them why would they not do that and our
 
04:46:30.890 --> 04:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
public schools and public charter
 
04:46:33.410 --> 04:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
schools do do the full background checks
 
04:46:35.810 --> 04:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure there are some that are are
 
04:46:37.430 --> 04:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
missing um
 
04:46:40.490 --> 04:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
in this this area and that that's what
 
04:46:43.070 --> 04:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses and it also includes
 
04:46:45.650 --> 04:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
volunteers and a lot of times the
 
04:46:47.570 --> 04:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
questions that we've had in the past
 
04:46:50.868 --> 04:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
about it was you know how do how do you
 
04:46:53.628 --> 04:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
define a volunteer and why would you
 
04:46:53.638 --> 04:46:54.410 align:start position:0%
define a volunteer and why would you
know

04:46:54.410 --> 04:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:46:56.570 --> 04:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
um for example if I went into a school
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
an elementary school to to just as a
 
04:47:01.970 --> 04:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
state representative and to talk to them
 
04:47:04.970 --> 04:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
about you know legislation for one day
 
04:47:06.590 --> 04:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
why would I have to get a background
 
04:47:08.810 --> 04:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
check from that school district or or
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
background check for that and the answer
 
04:47:15.770 --> 04:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
to that is that each um area each School
 
04:47:18.430 --> 04:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
non-school contracted Services
 
04:47:21.890 --> 04:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
can actually set up a policy where they
 
04:47:25.010 --> 04:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
have designated volunteers and basically
 
04:47:28.010 --> 04:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
designated volunteers from other
 
04:47:30.590 --> 04:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
policies and probably are you know
 
04:47:32.270 --> 04:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
probably the school boards Association
 
04:47:33.610 --> 04:47:33.620 align:start position:0%
has a
 
04:47:36.490 --> 04:47:36.500 align:start position:0%
has a
 
04:47:39.170 --> 04:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
directive on that that you could use or
 
04:47:41.390 --> 04:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
there are probably many around that are
 
04:47:41.400 --> 04:47:42.830 align:start position:0%
there are probably many around that are
modeled

04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
modeled
 
04:47:44.930 --> 04:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
um designated volunteer lists but
 
04:47:47.930 --> 04:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
basically it's those people that come in
 
04:47:49.490 --> 04:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis that have
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
unsupervised Time by a certified
 
04:47:55.310 --> 04:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
employee or those volunteers who
 
04:47:57.230 --> 04:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
volunteer on a regular basis like an
 
04:47:59.050 --> 04:47:59.060 align:start position:0%
assistant coach
 
04:48:01.788 --> 04:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
those working alone in a one-to-one
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
situation and I'd say also those working
 
04:48:08.270 --> 04:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
with two or three students in a private
 
04:48:10.730 --> 04:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
setting or even online and we have a lot
 
04:48:13.448 --> 04:48:13.458 align:start position:0%
of things online now and we know that
 
04:48:16.910 --> 04:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
that can be a real issue as well
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why I put in this bill
 
04:48:21.890 --> 04:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
um it's actually a bill that another
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative representative Porter put
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
in last term so thank you very much are
 
04:48:28.490 --> 04:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
04:48:30.590 --> 04:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:48:32.030 --> 04:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:48:34.430 --> 04:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:48:36.890 --> 04:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand the necessity
 
04:48:38.930 --> 04:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
for this bill and I think I heard you
 
04:48:41.690 --> 04:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
say that you're sure there are some
 
04:48:45.708 --> 04:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
missing do you know for a fact that some
 
04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
are missing background checks and have
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
you looked into that so the the our law
 
04:48:52.550 --> 04:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
is written says that
 
04:48:52.560 --> 04:48:53.230 align:start position:0%
is written says that
um

04:48:53.230 --> 04:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:56.030 --> 04:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
non-public schools May
 
04:48:59.090 --> 04:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
and and like I said if you're if you're
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
a non-public school
 
04:49:03.948 --> 04:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
um and you are worried about liability
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
which most of them should be
 
04:49:08.570 --> 04:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
um you've done it uh or if you have
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
liability insurance with you know places
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
like primex I'm sure they do a risk
 
04:49:15.788 --> 04:49:15.798 align:start position:0%
survey and one of their
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
directives is that you have to have
 
04:49:19.910 --> 04:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
these background checks the difference
 
04:49:19.920 --> 04:49:20.990 align:start position:0%
these background checks the difference
is

04:49:20.990 --> 04:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
between background checks that are you
 
04:49:26.150 --> 04:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
know if you go to work for Walmart and
 
04:49:27.830 --> 04:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
they say I want to do a background check
 
04:49:29.930 --> 04:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
they're worried about have you stolen
 
04:49:32.810 --> 04:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
before or arson or maybe
 
04:49:35.090 --> 04:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
um you know have you killed somebody but
 
04:49:37.788 --> 04:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
when you go into an education setting
 
04:49:39.890 --> 04:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
where you're working with children we
 
04:49:42.050 --> 04:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
want to know a lot more we want to know
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
if you have any um
 
04:49:46.970 --> 04:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
you know child pornography cases or if
 
04:49:50.208 --> 04:49:50.218 align:start position:0%
you've been arrested for assault so
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
there are and as I said in the statutes
 
04:49:55.250 --> 04:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
there's about 20 different
 
04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
um criminal backgrounds that are
 
04:50:01.010 --> 04:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
actually specifically checked under uh
 
04:50:02.990 --> 04:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
for educators or people that work with
 
04:50:05.448 --> 04:50:05.458 align:start position:0%
children in an educational setting
 
04:50:07.730 --> 04:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
so that's why I said that
 
04:50:10.610 --> 04:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
 
04:50:10.620 --> 04:50:13.010 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
bye

04:50:13.010 --> 04:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
bye
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for taking
 
04:50:16.010 --> 04:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
this question
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
um if we could go to number
 
04:50:18.958 --> 04:50:20.570 align:start position:0%
um if we could go to number
three

04:50:20.570 --> 04:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:50:23.628 --> 04:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
and it looks like Roman numeral one it's
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
hard to tell on this text it it starts
 
04:50:27.890 --> 04:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
with a receiving non-public school or
 
04:50:29.868 --> 04:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
home education program that paragraph
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah help me parse that the part that
 
04:50:35.448 --> 04:50:35.458 align:start position:0%
says and that complies with criminal
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
history background checks under RSA 77
 
04:50:42.830 --> 04:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
that phrase is modifying what person the
 
04:50:42.840 --> 04:50:45.050 align:start position:0%
that phrase is modifying what person the
receiving

04:50:45.050 --> 04:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
school or education program or the
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
students that benefit from scholarships
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:58.010 --> 04:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's um speaking to it it's in context
 
04:51:01.190 --> 04:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
with uh the second paragraph which talks
 
04:51:03.708 --> 04:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
about the employees and volunteers of
 
04:51:06.110 --> 04:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
non-public schools or providers that
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
choose to accept scholarship students
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
under this chapter so it's not you don't
 
04:51:12.350 --> 04:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
background check the students you
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
background check the employees and the
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
volunteers okay so it's the and how may
 
04:51:21.530 --> 04:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
I a receiving non-public school or home
 
04:51:24.410 --> 04:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
education program that complies with
 
04:51:27.050 --> 04:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
criminal history background checks is
 
04:51:30.470 --> 04:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:30.480 --> 04:51:32.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:51:32.350 --> 04:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:51:34.850 --> 04:51:34.860 align:start position:0%
this particular paragraph what it does
 
04:51:38.208 --> 04:51:38.218 align:start position:0%
is it it says that the receiving there's
 
04:51:41.090 --> 04:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of non-public schools some of
 
04:51:43.910 --> 04:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
those non-public schools may choose to
 
04:51:43.920 --> 04:51:44.750 align:start position:0%
those non-public schools may choose to
take

04:51:44.750 --> 04:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:51:47.570 --> 04:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
04:51:50.030 --> 04:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
the tax credits grants or scholarships
 
04:51:52.128 --> 04:51:52.138 align:start position:0%
and some don't
 
04:51:54.708 --> 04:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
so what that paragraph does is it says
 
04:51:56.810 --> 04:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
that this law only applies to those
 
04:51:59.750 --> 04:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
accepting those those scholarships
 
04:52:02.690 --> 04:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
grants or tax credits okay follow-up
 
04:52:04.730 --> 04:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
questions yes and and how does that
 
04:52:06.890 --> 04:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
apply to a home education program
 
04:52:10.010 --> 04:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
there's some some at least
 
04:52:12.310 --> 04:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
some home education programs actually
 
04:52:15.890 --> 04:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
have situations where they have
 
04:52:17.390 --> 04:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
um in fact we heard just the other day
 
04:52:19.010 --> 04:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
that one of the schools had about 100
 
04:52:19.020 --> 04:52:21.350 align:start position:0%
that one of the schools had about 100
students

04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:52:23.750 --> 04:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
um that were homeschooled that
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
04:52:35.208 --> 04:52:35.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for uh
 
04:52:37.610 --> 04:52:37.620 align:start position:0%
giving the opportunity to ask these
 
04:52:40.250 --> 04:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
questions this question of you
 
04:52:42.590 --> 04:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
um I see that you're also on the bill
 
04:52:44.330 --> 04:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
629 that we have coming up so I don't
 
04:52:46.730 --> 04:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
think we have to establish that
 
04:52:50.090 --> 04:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
um you believe obviously in the freedom
 
04:52:51.610 --> 04:52:51.620 align:start position:0%
to assemble
 
04:52:56.030 --> 04:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
what do you not think that represent
 
04:52:56.040 --> 04:52:58.190 align:start position:0%
what do you not think that represent
Belcher

04:52:58.190 --> 04:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
04:53:00.830 --> 04:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
I promise you this is on track well
 
04:53:03.110 --> 04:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
let's when we get there we'll be on
 
04:53:05.690 --> 04:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
track getting there too
 
04:53:07.010 --> 04:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
um do you not believe they're requiring
 
04:53:08.690 --> 04:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
a background check for instance for
 
04:53:10.730 --> 04:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
parents who simply want to come together
 
04:53:12.770 --> 04:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
with their children to assemble to teach
 
04:53:12.780 --> 04:53:14.628 align:start position:0%
with their children to assemble to teach
them

04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
is that not an undue burden on the
 
04:53:17.690 --> 04:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
freedom of assembly
 
04:53:21.170 --> 04:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
I believe that with public funds goes
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
public accountability and part of that
 
04:53:26.990 --> 04:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
accountability is making sure
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
that students regardless where they come
 
04:53:32.690 --> 04:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
from are
 
04:53:35.208 --> 04:53:35.218 align:start position:0%
as reasonably as we can
 
04:53:38.090 --> 04:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
safe from people who shouldn't be
 
04:53:41.208 --> 04:53:41.218 align:start position:0%
working with them whether they're
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
um whatever criminal background check
 
04:53:47.330 --> 04:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
that pops up and it obviously that we've
 
04:53:47.340 --> 04:53:48.288 align:start position:0%
that pops up and it obviously that we've
had

04:53:48.288 --> 04:53:48.298 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
instances in the past where it has
 
04:53:53.948 --> 04:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
happened this doesn't preclude 100
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
guarantee there's no 100 percent
 
04:53:58.250 --> 04:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
guarantee for all safety but I think
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's a function of what we do here
 
04:54:05.510 --> 04:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
just just to finish that line would you
 
04:54:06.770 --> 04:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
agree that there's nothing in this bill
 
04:54:09.948 --> 04:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
that would exempt parents from having to
 
04:54:11.448 --> 04:54:11.458 align:start position:0%
undergo background checks in order to
 
04:54:13.490 --> 04:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
homeschool their children in these
 
04:54:15.170 --> 04:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
little cooperatives or whatever they
 
04:54:15.180 --> 04:54:16.610 align:start position:0%
little cooperatives or whatever they
have

04:54:16.610 --> 04:54:16.620 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:54:16.620 --> 04:54:19.730 align:start position:0%
have
um

04:54:19.730 --> 04:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes again if they if if they're doing it
 
04:54:25.010 --> 04:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
on their own and they're not using
 
04:54:27.110 --> 04:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
public funds
 
04:54:29.330 --> 04:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
that with public funds comes public
 
04:54:32.448 --> 04:54:32.458 align:start position:0%
accountability and also the safety of
 
04:54:35.868 --> 04:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
our children representative cascadden
 
04:54:37.970 --> 04:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you my question was along that
 
04:54:39.890 --> 04:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
line as well
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
um if I want to homeschool my own
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
children and I don't attend a group
 
04:54:46.610 --> 04:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
Center or anything is there language
 
04:54:48.650 --> 04:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
here to protect me from having to do a
 
04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
criminal background check I don't as far
 
04:54:53.030 --> 04:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
as I read this Bill yes that you're
 
04:54:54.650 --> 04:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
protected you okay if you're in your
 
04:54:57.590 --> 04:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
home right doing your own kids and this
 
04:54:59.690 --> 04:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
is for when there are homeschool parents
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
who might drop their kids off at a
 
04:55:06.050 --> 04:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
center yes or assemble and work with
 
04:55:08.270 --> 04:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
multiple kids other than their own right
 
04:55:10.730 --> 04:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you thank you
 
04:55:14.410 --> 04:55:14.420 align:start position:0%
representative uh cordelli no thank you
 
04:55:17.448 --> 04:55:17.458 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:55:19.730 --> 04:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
um just follow me up on that
 
04:55:23.868 --> 04:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
um if uh home educating a parent
 
04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
um with several kids in the home
 
04:55:28.730 --> 04:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
um takes money from a tax credit
 
04:55:31.550 --> 04:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship program or from the EFA
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
program and is defined then as a an EFA
 
04:55:35.160 --> 04:55:36.128 align:start position:0%
program and is defined then as a an EFA
student

04:55:36.128 --> 04:55:36.138 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
with that parent who is teaching the
 
04:55:41.390 --> 04:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
child have to get a background check no
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's just what I believe Dr castad
 
04:55:46.010 --> 04:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
well I'm sorry I didn't hear the part
 
04:55:47.510 --> 04:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
about that they're accepting public
 
04:55:49.730 --> 04:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
funds because it says in here if they
 
04:55:51.890 --> 04:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
are receiving public funds they have to
 
04:55:54.110 --> 04:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
do a background check
 
04:55:56.690 --> 04:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
right and if they're in their own home
 
04:55:59.030 --> 04:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
with their own children
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
they're they're not under this
 
04:56:05.090 --> 04:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
getting the background checks it's a
 
04:56:07.070 --> 04:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
homeschool program home education
 
04:56:07.080 --> 04:56:10.610 align:start position:0%
homeschool program home education
program

04:56:10.610 --> 04:56:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:14.090 --> 04:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
it may be that it it may need amendment
 
04:56:15.770 --> 04:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
to that I mean this is what came from
 
04:56:17.150 --> 04:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
all or less
 
04:56:21.590 --> 04:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
um so yes you may follow okay thank you
 
04:56:21.600 --> 04:56:22.310 align:start position:0%
um so yes you may follow okay thank you
um

04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:25.310 --> 04:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
I think one fundamental problem I have
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
with the concept
 
04:56:31.310 --> 04:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
is that tax credit scholarship money
 
04:56:33.530 --> 04:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
is not public money
 
04:56:35.810 --> 04:56:35.820 align:start position:0%
it's been donated it's the courts have
 
04:56:37.610 --> 04:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
ruled such
 
04:56:39.490 --> 04:56:39.500 align:start position:0%
um and that money is going to a family
 
04:56:42.890 --> 04:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
and then uh same with efas that money
 
04:56:45.230 --> 04:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
goes to a family for them to use for any
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
one of a variety of
 
04:56:51.530 --> 04:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
um uh valid expenses it is no longer
 
04:56:54.170 --> 04:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
public money tax credit scholarship and
 
04:56:56.090 --> 04:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
money was never public money
 
04:57:00.170 --> 04:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
so the problem I have is
 
04:57:02.448 --> 04:57:02.458 align:start position:0%
um all of this that says receiving
 
04:57:05.390 --> 04:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
public money because these programs do
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
not fall underneath that
 
04:57:13.310 --> 04:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
um that uh provision and I would go to
 
04:57:13.320 --> 04:57:15.288 align:start position:0%
um that uh provision and I would go to
um

04:57:15.288 --> 04:57:15.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:19.610 --> 04:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
the state versus HR Supreme New
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court says uh the
 
04:57:24.050 --> 04:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
family and the rights of parents are
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
held to be natural essential inherent
 
04:57:28.610 --> 04:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
rights within the meaning of the
 
04:57:31.970 --> 04:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
Constitution part one article two
 
04:57:34.368 --> 04:57:34.378 align:start position:0%
um which I can also read to you if need
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
be but I think that
 
04:57:39.530 --> 04:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
this is not public money and you're
 
04:57:39.540 --> 04:57:40.930 align:start position:0%
this is not public money and you're
imposing

04:57:40.930 --> 04:57:40.940 align:start position:0%
imposing
 
04:57:43.850 --> 04:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
requirements on a family that has
 
04:57:46.430 --> 04:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
natural inherent rights to raise their
 
04:57:48.708 --> 04:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
children would you disagree with that
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
well it kind of sounded more like a
 
04:57:53.030 --> 04:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
lecture than a question I must say I I
 
04:57:56.208 --> 04:57:56.218 align:start position:0%
said would you agree with that no
 
04:57:58.550 --> 04:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further further
 
04:58:01.010 --> 04:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
questions representative Belcher thank
 
04:58:03.288 --> 04:58:03.298 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I was just reviewing and I
 
04:58:04.368 --> 04:58:04.378 align:start position:0%
know you already talked about this
 
04:58:06.708 --> 04:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
briefly starting with line 15 and going
 
04:58:09.288 --> 04:58:09.298 align:start position:0%
through line 18.
 
04:58:12.590 --> 04:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
um by adding the by adding this part and
 
04:58:13.788 --> 04:58:13.798 align:start position:0%
that complies with criminal history
 
04:58:16.850 --> 04:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
background checks under the RSA shall
 
04:58:19.190 --> 04:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
not be considered an agent of the state
 
04:58:21.288 --> 04:58:21.298 align:start position:0%
or federal government as a result of
 
04:58:23.208 --> 04:58:23.218 align:start position:0%
participating in this program
 
04:58:25.850 --> 04:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
does that kind of imply that if they
 
04:58:28.610 --> 04:58:28.620 align:start position:0%
fail to comply with the criminal history
 
04:58:31.310 --> 04:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
background check that they're somehow an
 
04:58:34.270 --> 04:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
agent of the state now
 
04:58:37.310 --> 04:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
I don't get that at all
 
04:58:42.708 --> 04:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
um that that's that's a reach I think
 
04:58:45.470 --> 04:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:48.830 --> 04:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh Balboni
 
04:58:51.110 --> 04:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
04:58:52.490 --> 04:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:58:55.070 --> 04:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
um if I am a parent of a public school
 
04:58:58.490 --> 04:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
student and I want to go in as a
 
04:59:01.368 --> 04:59:01.378 align:start position:0%
volunteer on a regular basis and work
 
04:59:04.010 --> 04:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
with a small group of children that I'm
 
04:59:06.410 --> 04:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
not in the costume but not in the
 
04:59:08.090 --> 04:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
auspices of the teacher itself but in
 
04:59:09.470 --> 04:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
another room working on a special
 
04:59:11.690 --> 04:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
program would I have to get a background
 
04:59:11.700 --> 04:59:13.208 align:start position:0%
program would I have to get a background
check

04:59:13.208 --> 04:59:13.218 align:start position:0%
check
 
04:59:17.030 --> 04:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
I think you would
 
04:59:18.530 --> 04:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden and
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative Ryan thank you just want
 
04:59:23.990 --> 04:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
to ask you if this clarifies things and
 
04:59:27.410 --> 04:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at line 15 I are receiving
 
04:59:29.448 --> 04:59:29.458 align:start position:0%
non-public school or home education
 
04:59:29.458 --> 04:59:30.948 align:start position:0%
non-public school or home education
program

04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:59:32.750 --> 04:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
if this language were added that
 
04:59:35.510 --> 04:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
assembles with more than the parents
 
04:59:35.520 --> 04:59:36.590 align:start position:0%
assembles with more than the parents
children

04:59:36.590 --> 04:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:59:38.208 --> 04:59:38.218 align:start position:0%
from scholarships grants or tax
 
04:59:41.090 --> 04:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
creditors if that addresses
 
04:59:43.070 --> 04:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
but your question was are you you
 
04:59:44.930 --> 04:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
offering that as an amendment
 
04:59:49.490 --> 04:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:51.948 --> 04:59:51.958 align:start position:0%
represent dry
 
04:59:54.250 --> 04:59:54.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:59:57.050 --> 04:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
193a describes the home education
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
program as the program that the parents
 
05:00:02.810 --> 05:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
set up for their children that's the
 
05:00:02.820 --> 05:00:04.190 align:start position:0%
set up for their children that's the
program

05:00:04.190 --> 05:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:00:06.650 --> 05:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
um are you thinking of something besides
 
05:00:08.448 --> 05:00:08.458 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't find that definition
 
05:00:11.390 --> 05:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
of program like a Cooperative or
 
05:00:13.250 --> 05:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
something like that instead of this I'm
 
05:00:15.230 --> 05:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
thinking are you using the wrong
 
05:00:18.530 --> 05:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
language here I I maybe and that may be
 
05:00:20.570 --> 05:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
a solution thank you
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison thank you Mr
 
05:00:24.170 --> 05:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:00:26.570 --> 05:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
some questions been raised about the EFA
 
05:00:28.270 --> 05:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
program and where the money comes from
 
05:00:30.830 --> 05:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh opinion on your part would you
 
05:00:33.230 --> 05:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
consider the funding of the EFA programs
 
05:00:35.208 --> 05:00:35.218 align:start position:0%
coming from a public entity and is
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
public money yes I think that's where
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
the money originates thank you okay what
 
05:00:42.610 --> 05:00:42.620 align:start position:0%
are the questions representative Belcher
 
05:00:45.470 --> 05:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
representative Miler thank you thank you
 
05:00:49.190 --> 05:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair is the intent of this bill
 
05:00:52.730 --> 05:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
and I've not heard you say anything uh
 
05:00:56.390 --> 05:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
against parents homeschooling kids but I
 
05:00:58.670 --> 05:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
think we've had a couple of issues come
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
before this committee this session
 
05:01:04.550 --> 05:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
that deals with a with a gathering in
 
05:01:06.410 --> 05:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
fact we've learned we've heard a term
 
05:01:08.690 --> 05:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
called Learning Centers for example
 
05:01:11.570 --> 05:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
where you've got multiple children
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
coming in periodically to a center
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
is so is the intent here is to try to
 
05:01:20.570 --> 05:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
deal with those individuals who are
 
05:01:22.910 --> 05:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
working in that kind of a conglomerate
 
05:01:26.810 --> 05:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
that they have some sort of a background
 
05:01:29.810 --> 05:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
check rather than an individual parent
 
05:01:32.448 --> 05:01:32.458 align:start position:0%
working at home with their child yes
 
05:01:34.610 --> 05:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's your intent yes okay thank you
 
05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:01:39.230 --> 05:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
05:01:40.730 --> 05:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:01:43.788 --> 05:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at section five bottom of
 
05:01:46.610 --> 05:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
page one and over to the top of page two
 
05:01:46.620 --> 05:01:48.170 align:start position:0%
page one and over to the top of page two
for

05:01:48.170 --> 05:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:01:51.530 --> 05:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
um Education Service Providers with the
 
05:01:54.110 --> 05:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
EFA program
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
um first I believe Staples is a service
 
05:02:00.530 --> 05:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
provider so I'm just wondering if
 
05:02:00.540 --> 05:02:02.510 align:start position:0%
provider so I'm just wondering if
um

05:02:02.510 --> 05:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:04.850 --> 05:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
we would have to get a criminal
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
background checks performed on
 
05:02:07.400 --> 05:02:09.310 align:start position:0%
background checks performed on
retail

05:02:09.310 --> 05:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
retail
 
05:02:13.550 --> 05:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
sales people from Staples Etc and
 
05:02:17.150 --> 05:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
secondly it says indeed submit the
 
05:02:20.990 --> 05:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
results of those checks who is Staples
 
05:02:23.750 --> 05:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to submit those background checks
 
05:02:23.760 --> 05:02:27.948 align:start position:0%
going to submit those background checks
too

05:02:27.948 --> 05:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:30.530 --> 05:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
I think um if you go back to the intent
 
05:02:33.948 --> 05:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
and you go back to the volunteers uh the
 
05:02:35.868 --> 05:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
intent was that the the education
 
05:02:40.490 --> 05:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
service providers were like prenda or uh
 
05:02:43.070 --> 05:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
other educational service providers that
 
05:02:44.510 --> 05:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
were being set up
 
05:02:44.520 --> 05:02:45.650 align:start position:0%
were being set up
um

05:02:45.650 --> 05:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:49.550 --> 05:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
for uh tuition programs and
 
05:02:51.708 --> 05:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
perhaps that needs to be cleaned up a
 
05:02:53.810 --> 05:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
little bit I'm sure Amazon does
 
05:02:56.208 --> 05:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
background checks on all their employees
 
05:02:58.850 --> 05:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
uh they probably do not do background
 
05:03:01.128 --> 05:03:01.138 align:start position:0%
checks on um
 
05:03:03.350 --> 05:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
the way that with the 20s specific
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks that we have
 
05:03:07.970 --> 05:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
for educators and they're not in a
 
05:03:11.208 --> 05:03:11.218 align:start position:0%
position where you know a distributor or
 
05:03:15.050 --> 05:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
a warehouse worker or a salesperson at
 
05:03:16.788 --> 05:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
Amazon certainly doesn't meet the
 
05:03:19.010 --> 05:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
qualifications of a designated volunteer
 
05:03:21.170 --> 05:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:03:25.490 --> 05:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:27.050 --> 05:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
um just continuing with the language in
 
05:03:30.480 --> 05:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
um just continuing with the language in
that

05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:31.680 --> 05:03:32.448 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:03:32.448 --> 05:03:32.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:36.530 --> 05:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
same part lines 26 through line three on
 
05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
the next page
 
05:03:41.208 --> 05:03:41.218 align:start position:0%
just wanted to note that it seems clear
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
that your intent in saying
 
05:03:46.190 --> 05:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh any employee or volunteer providing
 
05:03:48.890 --> 05:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
instruction in person to an EFA student
 
05:03:53.090 --> 05:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
so I don't think and would you concur
 
05:03:55.850 --> 05:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
that the folks at Staples are providing
 
05:03:58.250 --> 05:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
instruction in person
 
05:04:03.170 --> 05:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:04.910 --> 05:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
what are the questions represent Belcher
 
05:04:06.288 --> 05:04:06.298 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
05:04:07.910 --> 05:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
clarify because I believe I heard the
 
05:04:09.708 --> 05:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
possibility for an amendment floated
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
seemed like the sponsor may have been
 
05:04:13.610 --> 05:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
someone amenable to it I just wanted to
 
05:04:15.650 --> 05:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
clarify the outlines of it possibly
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
inserting a language that would exempt a
 
05:04:20.150 --> 05:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
parent who wanted to teach their own
 
05:04:20.160 --> 05:04:21.230 align:start position:0%
parent who wanted to teach their own
children

05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
however if two families say neighbors
 
05:04:26.208 --> 05:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
wanted to get together and collectively
 
05:04:27.890 --> 05:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
teach their children then they would
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
have to get a background check
 
05:04:32.930 --> 05:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
yes well I think that's opening it up a
 
05:04:34.670 --> 05:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
little bit if if we
 
05:04:37.910 --> 05:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
it depends on how we want to write that
 
05:04:39.708 --> 05:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
um because then then you're going to get
 
05:04:42.770 --> 05:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
into the nitty-gritty of how many
 
05:04:45.708 --> 05:04:45.718 align:start position:0%
families get together you know that how
 
05:04:47.930 --> 05:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
often all that
 
05:04:49.730 --> 05:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to be alone with
 
05:04:52.550 --> 05:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
the other children that sort of thing so
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions in the
 
05:04:55.440 --> 05:04:57.110 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions in the
committee

05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:04:58.850 --> 05:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
are those red lights on because people
 
05:05:02.208 --> 05:05:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:05.410 --> 05:05:05.420 align:start position:0%
no I guess represent Tanner's up there
 
05:05:08.208 --> 05:05:08.218 align:start position:0%
okay I got it both places okay are there
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions so again thank you
 
05:05:11.810 --> 05:05:11.820 align:start position:0%

05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
have about 14
 
05:05:47.868 --> 05:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
000 members
 
05:05:50.810 --> 05:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
last year this committee considered an
 
05:05:54.288 --> 05:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
identical Bill House Bill 1664 and had a
 
05:05:56.930 --> 05:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting in October that
 
05:05:59.810 --> 05:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
expanded the bill to include traditional
 
05:06:04.550 --> 05:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers those who follow 193 a the
 
05:06:07.610 --> 05:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
families who do not receive taxpayer
 
05:06:10.070 --> 05:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
sourced financial support and that is
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
exactly why I'm here today
 
05:06:16.010 --> 05:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
because I believe hb628 is a slippery
 
05:06:19.070 --> 05:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
slope and it can overreach into these
 
05:06:21.050 --> 05:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
traditional home educating families
 
05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard comments about that already
 
05:06:23.280 --> 05:06:24.530 align:start position:0%
we've heard comments about that already
today

05:06:24.530 --> 05:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:06:26.810 --> 05:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
early in the subcommittee's comments
 
05:06:28.750 --> 05:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
they discussed
 
05:06:31.610 --> 05:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
pulling unfunded homeschoolers into a
 
05:06:34.250 --> 05:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
pool of quote Bad actors
 
05:06:36.890 --> 05:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
who supposedly may use home education to
 
05:06:38.750 --> 05:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
hide child abuse
 
05:06:41.330 --> 05:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
this was on the record there's a video
 
05:06:44.810 --> 05:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
it's it's there this is an unfounded
 
05:06:47.390 --> 05:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
accusation of families and reaches far
 
05:06:50.090 --> 05:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of last year's Bill HB
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
1664 and today's Bill HB 628
 
05:06:56.810 --> 05:06:56.820 align:start position:0%
traditional homeschool families who
 
05:07:01.430 --> 05:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
follow RSA 193a do not receive Public
 
05:07:04.868 --> 05:07:04.878 align:start position:0%
Funding even if they utilize prenda
 
05:07:07.850 --> 05:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
K-pop learning groups or classes through
 
05:07:10.910 --> 05:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
vlax traditional homeschool families do
 
05:07:13.250 --> 05:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
not have funds deposited into an account
 
05:07:17.690 --> 05:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
in their names so HB 628 in no way shape
 
05:07:20.090 --> 05:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
or form should apply to them
 
05:07:22.310 --> 05:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
that absolutely needs to be clarified
 
05:07:24.288 --> 05:07:24.298 align:start position:0%
because we're already hearing amendments
 
05:07:27.470 --> 05:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
that how do you define co-ops or book
 
05:07:29.690 --> 05:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
clubs or do you dare leave your child
 
05:07:31.730 --> 05:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
with your friend for an hour while you
 
05:07:33.708 --> 05:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
get your grocery shopping done this is
 
05:07:33.718 --> 05:07:35.330 align:start position:0%
get your grocery shopping done this is
ridiculous

05:07:35.330 --> 05:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
this is an unfounded Witch Hunt to
 
05:07:40.010 --> 05:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
suggest that homeschoolers are hiding or
 
05:07:41.868 --> 05:07:41.878 align:start position:0%
using educational options to remove
 
05:07:44.270 --> 05:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
their children from society's long list
 
05:07:47.390 --> 05:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
of mandatory reporters in New Hampshire
 
05:07:50.270 --> 05:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
every adult is considered a mandatory
 
05:07:53.208 --> 05:07:53.218 align:start position:0%
reported of suspected child abuse it's
 
05:07:54.670 --> 05:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
05:07:58.670 --> 05:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
169-c and it has a long list of who is a
 
05:08:00.948 --> 05:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporter and goes beyond who
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
the school Personnel or doctors or
 
05:08:06.948 --> 05:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
dentists it says expressly any other
 
05:08:10.850 --> 05:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
persons so that would include coaches
 
05:08:15.650 --> 05:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
friends neighbors tutors your Co your
 
05:08:18.410 --> 05:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
friends in a play group Librarians the
 
05:08:20.510 --> 05:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
families you meet up with at the local
 
05:08:24.410 --> 05:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
park anybody who encounters a child is
 
05:08:26.270 --> 05:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
obligated to report it if they believe
 
05:08:28.570 --> 05:08:28.580 align:start position:0%
that child is endangered
 
05:08:31.550 --> 05:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
the new the national home education
 
05:08:34.610 --> 05:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
Research Institute released a study last
 
05:08:37.128 --> 05:08:37.138 align:start position:0%
March that examined research of abuse
 
05:08:39.230 --> 05:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
associated with public private and home
 
05:08:42.288 --> 05:08:42.298 align:start position:0%
educated students while there are very
 
05:08:44.930 --> 05:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
few studies and many are quite old the
 
05:08:47.570 --> 05:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
organization compiled results of all
 
05:08:49.910 --> 05:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
available research and found there is no
 
05:08:51.770 --> 05:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
empirical evidence to suggest that home
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
educated children are abused more or
 
05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
less than students in other educational
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
Pathways so this bill can way too easily
 
05:09:02.448 --> 05:09:02.458 align:start position:0%
turn into a Witch Hunt of parents
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
child abuse is abhorrent and a tragedy
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of where a child is enrolled
 
05:09:10.730 --> 05:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
while the goal to protect all children
 
05:09:14.570 --> 05:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
is universally supported expanding HB
 
05:09:17.570 --> 05:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
628 to these unfunded homeschoolers in
 
05:09:20.030 --> 05:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 193-a
 
05:09:22.070 --> 05:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
simply because they home educate their
 
05:09:25.070 --> 05:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
children and may use co-ops with friends
 
05:09:26.690 --> 05:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
and other
 
05:09:29.868 --> 05:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
similarly homeschooling families is
 
05:09:32.570 --> 05:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
absurd and misdirected
 
05:09:35.390 --> 05:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
if parents mistreat their children New
 
05:09:37.430 --> 05:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law has mechanisms to remove
 
05:09:39.530 --> 05:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
their parental rights and that includes
 
05:09:41.090 --> 05:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
their Authority regarding education
 
05:09:41.100 --> 05:09:42.170 align:start position:0%
their Authority regarding education
choices

05:09:42.170 --> 05:09:42.180 align:start position:0%
choices
 
05:09:44.390 --> 05:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
if this bill applies to homeschooling
 
05:09:45.948 --> 05:09:45.958 align:start position:0%
families who are not mistreating their
 
05:09:48.530 --> 05:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
children this is entirely absurd
 
05:09:51.590 --> 05:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
unfounded and a gross overreach of House
 
05:09:55.310 --> 05:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
Bill 628 and government intrusion
 
05:09:58.368 --> 05:09:58.378 align:start position:0%
further if HB 628 is extended to these
 
05:10:01.070 --> 05:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
193-a homeschooling families who do not
 
05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
receive taxpayer money as suggested by
 
05:10:06.050 --> 05:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
members of that subcommittee who are
 
05:10:08.208 --> 05:10:08.218 align:start position:0%
still on this committee today
 
05:10:11.090 --> 05:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
it amounts to a baseless inquisition of
 
05:10:12.650 --> 05:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers and presumes they are
 
05:10:14.628 --> 05:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
guilty until proven innocent
 
05:10:16.850 --> 05:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
Granite State Home Educators
 
05:10:18.650 --> 05:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
urges this committee to oppose this bill
 
05:10:21.110 --> 05:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
and do not involve homeschooling
 
05:10:24.288 --> 05:10:24.298 align:start position:0%
families in any way shape or form I have
 
05:10:26.208 --> 05:10:26.218 align:start position:0%
one copy for the clerk and I already
 
05:10:29.090 --> 05:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
have a electronic copy that should
 
05:10:31.430 --> 05:10:31.440 align:start position:0%

already scheduled so check your email
 
05:10:35.208 --> 05:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
for your own personal copy thank you
 
05:10:36.708 --> 05:10:36.718 align:start position:0%
Michelle are there any questions from
 
05:10:38.990 --> 05:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Miler thank
 
05:10:40.430 --> 05:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for being
 
05:10:42.890 --> 05:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
here and advocating for your
 
05:10:45.650 --> 05:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
constituencies the question I'd have for
 
05:10:48.170 --> 05:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
you that should this committee
 
05:10:50.090 --> 05:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
be concerned
 
05:10:54.530 --> 05:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
about uh bills that would provide safety
 
05:10:57.410 --> 05:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
for kids in areas where they're going to
 
05:10:59.690 --> 05:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
have their education and notwithstanding
 
05:11:01.368 --> 05:11:01.378 align:start position:0%
the homeschoolers I understand your
 
05:11:03.670 --> 05:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
position there but Beyond The Homeschool
 
05:11:06.650 --> 05:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
activities kids that are going to be
 
05:11:09.770 --> 05:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
going to these service providers should
 
05:11:12.410 --> 05:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
we be concerned about their safety uh
 
05:11:14.270 --> 05:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
and these kinds of backgrounds checks
 
05:11:17.390 --> 05:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
for people who are basically sponsoring
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
and uh providing these Services thank
 
05:11:23.230 --> 05:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
you for the question appreciate that
 
05:11:25.610 --> 05:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
when parents are in charge of their
 
05:11:28.070 --> 05:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
children's learning and they are when
 
05:11:31.010 --> 05:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
they're homeschooling families RSA 193a
 
05:11:31.020 --> 05:11:32.270 align:start position:0%
they're homeschooling families RSA 193a
families

05:11:32.270 --> 05:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
families
 
05:11:35.448 --> 05:11:35.458 align:start position:0%
and I would extend that to pretty a lot
 
05:11:37.128 --> 05:11:37.138 align:start position:0%
of these other options that are now
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
available families are choosing who they
 
05:11:42.470 --> 05:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
work with as their service providers
 
05:11:45.110 --> 05:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
families can find out if background
 
05:11:48.050 --> 05:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
checks are done or not or if so by whom
 
05:11:51.770 --> 05:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
and to what extent at some point do you
 
05:11:55.430 --> 05:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
trust parents or don't you do they make
 
05:11:57.410 --> 05:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
good decisions for their children or
 
05:11:59.810 --> 05:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
don't they and I think at some point
 
05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
you've parents do their due diligence as
 
05:12:06.170 --> 05:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
to the music program they enroll their
 
05:12:08.990 --> 05:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
children in or the uh
 
05:12:10.970 --> 05:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
martial arts program
 
05:12:13.850 --> 05:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
they choose are they comfortable having
 
05:12:17.330 --> 05:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
their child there or not and I I believe
 
05:12:19.730 --> 05:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
the parents make those decisions every
 
05:12:22.368 --> 05:12:22.378 align:start position:0%
day so if and I don't know if it works
 
05:12:24.650 --> 05:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
in your mouth but my my sense and your
 
05:12:27.110 --> 05:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
your answer is that we sh we don't have
 
05:12:29.330 --> 05:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
to worry about that because that's the
 
05:12:32.270 --> 05:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
parents responsibility is that correct
 
05:12:34.368 --> 05:12:34.378 align:start position:0%
I believe parents are the best ones to
 
05:12:36.650 --> 05:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
know who these individuals are and what
 
05:12:38.570 --> 05:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
programs are available and what they're
 
05:12:40.850 --> 05:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
comfortable with thank you for the
 
05:12:43.510 --> 05:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:12:46.430 --> 05:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
05:12:59.150 --> 05:12:59.160 align:start position:0%

to you today my name is Christy Whipple
 
05:13:07.070 --> 05:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm the current head of school at the
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
Newport Montessori school we were
 
05:13:11.510 --> 05:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier I think indirectly and
 
05:13:12.830 --> 05:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
I've been in that position for the past
 
05:13:14.330 --> 05:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
17 years
 
05:13:16.910 --> 05:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
our school is required to and does
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
conduct criminal background checks on
 
05:13:21.410 --> 05:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
all of our employees we do this for all
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
employees regardless of whether or not
 
05:13:25.490 --> 05:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
the employee provides in-person or
 
05:13:28.010 --> 05:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
direct instruction for example our three
 
05:13:29.810 --> 05:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
hour a day custodian is background
 
05:13:29.820 --> 05:13:30.948 align:start position:0%
hour a day custodian is background
checked

05:13:30.948 --> 05:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
checked
 
05:13:33.190 --> 05:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire State Police
 
05:13:35.750 --> 05:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
just as our direct instruction teachers
 
05:13:38.628 --> 05:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
are our school does not currently
 
05:13:38.638 --> 05:13:42.788 align:start position:0%
are our school does not currently
um

05:13:42.788 --> 05:13:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
you're good one more time sorry
 
05:13:48.530 --> 05:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
um we do not do that we don't conduct
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
background checks for our parent
 
05:13:52.490 --> 05:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
volunteers as this bill proposes and we
 
05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
don't do this because they're never in
 
05:13:55.970 --> 05:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
charge of students they're never
 
05:13:57.948 --> 05:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
providing direct instruction they're
 
05:14:01.190 --> 05:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
never alone in a room with students we
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
use our parent Guardians and volunteers
 
05:14:05.090 --> 05:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
rarely however when we do it's for
 
05:14:07.010 --> 05:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
things like our winter program which
 
05:14:09.050 --> 05:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
just concluded yesterday on Sunapee
 
05:14:10.368 --> 05:14:10.378 align:start position:0%
super fun
 
05:14:12.470 --> 05:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
and the rain held off
 
05:14:15.170 --> 05:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
uh let's see we used our help in
 
05:14:16.730 --> 05:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
transporting to students to and from
 
05:14:18.288 --> 05:14:18.298 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a large busing
 
05:14:20.570 --> 05:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
ability at our school so we use their
 
05:14:22.190 --> 05:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
help in transporting students to and
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
from the school in the mountain they
 
05:14:26.330 --> 05:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
might be transporting their own child
 
05:14:28.250 --> 05:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
and perhaps a friend or two of that
 
05:14:30.530 --> 05:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
student however those students who are
 
05:14:32.990 --> 05:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
not their child those parents have given
 
05:14:34.430 --> 05:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
permission for them to ride in that
 
05:14:35.930 --> 05:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
vehicle just as they would if they were
 
05:14:38.330 --> 05:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
picking them up after school for a play
 
05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
date or a sleepover
 
05:14:43.128 --> 05:14:43.138 align:start position:0%
require requiring us to do background
 
05:14:44.810 --> 05:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
checks on our parent volunteers and
 
05:14:46.910 --> 05:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
Guardians is concerning for a fiscal
 
05:14:49.430 --> 05:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
reason we're a non-profit school so for
 
05:14:51.470 --> 05:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
each background check that we conduct we
 
05:14:53.390 --> 05:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
provide that we pay for that for our
 
05:14:55.750 --> 05:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
staff members so that would be a direct
 
05:14:57.948 --> 05:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
expense to the school that we are not
 
05:14:59.628 --> 05:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
budgeted for
 
05:15:01.070 --> 05:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
um I thought I would also share in
 
05:15:02.990 --> 05:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
listening to earlier testimony that I'm
 
05:15:04.250 --> 05:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
a member of the New Hampshire Department
 
05:15:05.990 --> 05:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
of education's non-public school
 
05:15:07.730 --> 05:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and I've been in that
 
05:15:10.430 --> 05:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
role for several years and I'm not aware
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
of a single approved non-public school
 
05:15:14.990 --> 05:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
that does not background check are
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
people who provide direct instruction so
 
05:15:18.770 --> 05:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
I think someone asked earlier if there
 
05:15:21.050 --> 05:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
was anyone I'm not aware of any
 
05:15:23.510 --> 05:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the example by representative Tanner
 
05:15:25.250 --> 05:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
who may go into several schools to speak
 
05:15:27.650 --> 05:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
to students then each school would have
 
05:15:29.270 --> 05:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
to conduct their background check on her
 
05:15:31.368 --> 05:15:31.378 align:start position:0%
at an expense to the school so if
 
05:15:32.990 --> 05:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
they're speaking if it's something that
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
they do for a living and they're
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
speaking at five to ten schools all of
 
05:15:37.310 --> 05:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
those schools would have to conduct
 
05:15:39.050 --> 05:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
those background checks because we're
 
05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
not able to share that information with
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
one another
 
05:15:43.910 --> 05:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's all today
 
05:15:45.230 --> 05:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:15:48.310 --> 05:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative thank you
 
05:15:51.590 --> 05:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for finally meeting you it's
 
05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
nice to meet you in person as well we've
 
05:15:56.090 --> 05:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about your school here and
 
05:15:58.368 --> 05:15:58.378 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you're here to finally put a
 
05:16:00.590 --> 05:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
face with the with the school how many
 
05:16:03.170 --> 05:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
students are in your school right 107.
 
05:16:07.730 --> 05:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
is that your max 110 a 110 okay well
 
05:16:09.350 --> 05:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome thank
 
05:16:10.610 --> 05:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
you very much I have a question for you
 
05:16:12.110 --> 05:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
because I also we've talked to your
 
05:16:14.150 --> 05:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
school many many times
 
05:16:16.010 --> 05:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
um if you're going to take a field trip
 
05:16:18.590 --> 05:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
with some kids and you're using parents
 
05:16:21.288 --> 05:16:21.298 align:start position:0%
as volunteer drivers do you have
 
05:16:23.628 --> 05:16:23.638 align:start position:0%
background checks on those drivers we
 
05:16:25.128 --> 05:16:25.138 align:start position:0%
don't background check the drivers but
 
05:16:27.230 --> 05:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
we do require their insurance
 
05:16:28.910 --> 05:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay that's something that our insurance
 
05:16:30.830 --> 05:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
requires us to have a copy of their
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
driving Insurance yep thank you very
 
05:16:32.878 --> 05:16:35.208 align:start position:0%
driving Insurance yep thank you very
much

05:16:35.208 --> 05:16:35.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:37.788 --> 05:16:37.798 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:16:39.288 --> 05:16:39.298 align:start position:0%
thank you very much all right thank you
 
05:16:49.010 --> 05:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:51.410 --> 05:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon
 
05:16:53.208 --> 05:16:53.218 align:start position:0%
my name is Emily Van Patten I'm a
 
05:16:54.890 --> 05:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
resident of deer in New Hampshire please
 
05:16:56.448 --> 05:16:56.458 align:start position:0%
include this testimony in the Bill's
 
05:16:58.670 --> 05:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
permanent record my husband and I
 
05:17:00.230 --> 05:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
believe so strongly in the benefits of
 
05:17:01.550 --> 05:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
homeschooling that in addition to having
 
05:17:02.990 --> 05:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
full-time jobs we have chosen The
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
Homeschool our three children I only
 
05:17:07.010 --> 05:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we work full-time to
 
05:17:09.708 --> 05:17:09.718 align:start position:0%
underscore that I oppose hb628 so much
 
05:17:11.208 --> 05:17:11.218 align:start position:0%
that I was willing to rearrange my
 
05:17:12.590 --> 05:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
schedule and take time off to be here
 
05:17:12.600 --> 05:17:13.430 align:start position:0%
schedule and take time off to be here
today

05:17:13.430 --> 05:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:17:16.368 --> 05:17:16.378 align:start position:0%
as you consider hb628 please reflect on
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
the absurdity that I should have to go
 
05:17:19.910 --> 05:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
undergo a background check to be able to
 
05:17:21.708 --> 05:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
educate my children when my number one
 
05:17:24.050 --> 05:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
priority is to protect them I didn't
 
05:17:25.910 --> 05:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
need a background check to have them I
 
05:17:27.288 --> 05:17:27.298 align:start position:0%
shouldn't need one to be able to support
 
05:17:29.030 --> 05:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
their education and to nurture their
 
05:17:29.040 --> 05:17:29.990 align:start position:0%
their education and to nurture their
learning

05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
learning
 
05:17:33.770 --> 05:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
HP 2 6 I'm sorry HP 628 should instead
 
05:17:35.330 --> 05:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
mandate that government contract
 
05:17:36.890 --> 05:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
shoulder the responsibility of
 
05:17:38.570 --> 05:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
background checks for personnel who are
 
05:17:40.430 --> 05:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
in direct contact with children if it is
 
05:17:43.368 --> 05:17:43.378 align:start position:0%
not already required in conclusion I
 
05:17:46.430 --> 05:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
oppose hb628 thank you for your time
 
05:17:48.350 --> 05:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
05:17:49.850 --> 05:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:17:57.590 --> 05:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you for your time my name
 
05:18:11.150 --> 05:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
is Abigail Belmore I'm from Chester New
 
05:18:13.730 --> 05:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm in a unique position I am
 
05:18:15.110 --> 05:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
a traditional homeschooler I do not
 
05:18:17.270 --> 05:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
accept any funding at all never have
 
05:18:19.490 --> 05:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
never will I also am in a unique
 
05:18:22.430 --> 05:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
position I run a unfunded traditional
 
05:18:25.010 --> 05:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
homeschooler co-op with six other
 
05:18:25.020 --> 05:18:26.150 align:start position:0%
homeschooler co-op with six other
parents

05:18:26.150 --> 05:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:18:28.190 --> 05:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
I feel that this would apply to me in
 
05:18:31.090 --> 05:18:31.100 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to run a Cooperative
 
05:18:34.670 --> 05:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
educational system for our children
 
05:18:37.010 --> 05:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
this is on the Fly I was not prepared to
 
05:18:38.690 --> 05:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
write this because I am a very busy
 
05:18:38.700 --> 05:18:39.590 align:start position:0%
write this because I am a very busy
parent

05:18:39.590 --> 05:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
parent
 
05:18:42.288 --> 05:18:42.298 align:start position:0%
all right as a co-op leader I'm unfunded
 
05:18:44.930 --> 05:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
I also am an unfunded homeschooler I
 
05:18:46.810 --> 05:18:46.820 align:start position:0%
would feel that this bill would un
 
05:18:49.730 --> 05:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
impact families that are co-teaching
 
05:18:50.868 --> 05:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
because that's essentially what we're
 
05:18:52.550 --> 05:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
doing we're building basis building
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
education for our children that maybe
 
05:18:57.530 --> 05:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not really writing math as an
 
05:19:00.050 --> 05:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
example maybe my friend is a math wizard
 
05:19:02.150 --> 05:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
whereas I'm good in English we can
 
05:19:03.350 --> 05:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
collaborate to make sure our children
 
05:19:05.448 --> 05:19:05.458 align:start position:0%
get the best education possible because
 
05:19:07.550 --> 05:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
what if one child is better in math in
 
05:19:09.350 --> 05:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
English and we feel like we're losing
 
05:19:11.208 --> 05:19:11.218 align:start position:0%
them and we don't feel that we can teach
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
them to a certain standard we can at
 
05:19:15.470 --> 05:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
least have our friend that is wanting to
 
05:19:17.628 --> 05:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
have their child get better education in
 
05:19:21.170 --> 05:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
English where I need better help in math
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
so it's co-teaching we're not accepting
 
05:19:25.788 --> 05:19:25.798 align:start position:0%
money or funding in any way or form
 
05:19:30.410 --> 05:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:32.510 --> 05:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
we are just building a well-rounded
 
05:19:34.970 --> 05:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
education by supporting individual
 
05:19:36.770 --> 05:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
strengths and weaknesses because the
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
parents are trying to build a better
 
05:19:41.628 --> 05:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
education for our children by our
 
05:19:48.470 --> 05:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:51.530 --> 05:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
let's see the other position I'm in I'm
 
05:19:54.050 --> 05:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
also a overachiever volunteer I
 
05:19:57.070 --> 05:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer for several National
 
05:20:00.050 --> 05:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
organizations and in my community that
 
05:20:01.850 --> 05:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
all benefit my children's extra
 
05:20:04.490 --> 05:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
activities an example would be 4-H I'm
 
05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
extensively background checked for this
 
05:20:10.730 --> 05:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
program I am also a representative for
 
05:20:13.368 --> 05:20:13.378 align:start position:0%
our soccer Department league in our town
 
05:20:15.708 --> 05:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
I am also extensively and fingerprinted
 
05:20:18.288 --> 05:20:18.298 align:start position:0%
for this program I'm also a private
 
05:20:20.208 --> 05:20:20.218 align:start position:0%
Carry I've been background checked for
 
05:20:21.890 --> 05:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
that also to be part of my local gun
 
05:20:21.900 --> 05:20:22.670 align:start position:0%
that also to be part of my local gun
club

05:20:22.670 --> 05:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
club
 
05:20:25.670 --> 05:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay I get those right those background
 
05:20:27.948 --> 05:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
checks but to teach my children in a
 
05:20:30.650 --> 05:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
Cooperative co-parenting situation
 
05:20:33.288 --> 05:20:33.298 align:start position:0%
I do not find that necessary because I
 
05:20:35.208 --> 05:20:35.218 align:start position:0%
am choosing what my children's education
 
05:20:38.150 --> 05:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
is even if I chose to use either online
 
05:20:40.970 --> 05:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
programs whether I used to choose to
 
05:20:43.750 --> 05:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
have easy access into my school system
 
05:20:46.730 --> 05:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
to have particular subjects that my
 
05:20:48.530 --> 05:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
children might need have better balance
 
05:20:50.690 --> 05:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
in that I can't provide
 
05:20:52.310 --> 05:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that the public school
 
05:20:53.750 --> 05:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
system is going to have some form of
 
05:20:55.490 --> 05:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
background check for their children to
 
05:20:57.110 --> 05:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
be taught by parents because they're
 
05:21:01.310 --> 05:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:04.128 --> 05:21:04.138 align:start position:0%
but for the activities that I do extra I
 
05:21:06.230 --> 05:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
have been back around extensively
 
05:21:08.570 --> 05:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
I find that those are necessary not to
 
05:21:11.448 --> 05:21:11.458 align:start position:0%
educate my children or to choose what I
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
educate my children how and when
 
05:21:17.208 --> 05:21:17.218 align:start position:0%
thank you like I said it was on the Fly
 
05:21:19.490 --> 05:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming today yes are there
 
05:21:20.930 --> 05:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
further questions from the county yes
 
05:21:22.550 --> 05:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell
 
05:21:25.128 --> 05:21:25.138 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for all you do but
 
05:21:26.990 --> 05:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
you said you don't accept any funds for
 
05:21:28.310 --> 05:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
the homeschooling that you do for your
 
05:21:30.170 --> 05:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
children no we bring our own stuff we
 
05:21:33.590 --> 05:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
collaborate and we we choose as a group
 
05:21:35.390 --> 05:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
what we're choosing to teach like
 
05:21:37.430 --> 05:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
examples we're using the state program
 
05:21:38.868 --> 05:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
moose on the loose for our history
 
05:21:40.190 --> 05:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
program because it's one of those check
 
05:21:41.930 --> 05:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
boxes that are required as a home
 
05:21:44.990 --> 05:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
educator to subject our children to
 
05:21:47.448 --> 05:21:47.458 align:start position:0%
State history which we totally agree
 
05:21:49.970 --> 05:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
with so we use that we chose to do that
 
05:21:51.110 --> 05:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
and we
 
05:21:53.690 --> 05:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
are following the program but within our
 
05:21:56.570 --> 05:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
own reason to gauge a multiple level
 
05:21:59.810 --> 05:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
education following up yeah so so I may
 
05:22:01.250 --> 05:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
be wrong but I don't think this would
 
05:22:04.368 --> 05:22:04.378 align:start position:0%
apply to you because it says accepts it
 
05:22:06.530 --> 05:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
would bleed in because I'm what if we
 
05:22:08.090 --> 05:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
chose what if one of those parents chose
 
05:22:10.490 --> 05:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
to accept the educational system
 
05:22:13.070 --> 05:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
the funding none of them do I know they
 
05:22:14.330 --> 05:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
don't but what if they change what if
 
05:22:15.708 --> 05:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
something changed
 
05:22:18.230 --> 05:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
and they needed to the economy is not
 
05:22:20.810 --> 05:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
what it was a year ago
 
05:22:23.448 --> 05:22:23.458 align:start position:0%
thank you representative miler
 
05:22:25.430 --> 05:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr that and thanks for being
 
05:22:28.570 --> 05:22:28.580 align:start position:0%
here I I have really three questions one
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh because I'm not familiar with Co-op
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
teaching so how many families are in
 
05:22:37.610 --> 05:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
your Co-op six how many students are in
 
05:22:41.390 --> 05:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
the 25 and and how do those do you
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
gather on a regular basis once a week
 
05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
okay and and do like for the whole day
 
05:22:48.590 --> 05:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
and you have different topics you talk
 
05:22:51.708 --> 05:22:51.718 align:start position:0%
about we do history science uh
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
historical figure in a craft maybe a
 
05:22:56.090 --> 05:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
little bit of English fun stuff like
 
05:22:57.470 --> 05:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
teaching them what an advertisement
 
05:22:59.330 --> 05:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
meant and how to apply one and do one
 
05:23:01.250 --> 05:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
would be an example
 
05:23:02.868 --> 05:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
um science we're doing solar system and
 
05:23:04.128 --> 05:23:04.138 align:start position:0%
we've got a little program we're doing
 
05:23:06.590 --> 05:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing some online videos and we've
 
05:23:08.208 --> 05:23:08.218 align:start position:0%
got telescopes that we're trying to do
 
05:23:10.550 --> 05:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
and do an off day program where we can
 
05:23:12.230 --> 05:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
do that at night when the sky is done
 
05:23:14.090 --> 05:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
05:23:15.288 --> 05:23:15.298 align:start position:0%
um crafts that we just pulled from
 
05:23:16.970 --> 05:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
online and we all agree
 
05:23:19.490 --> 05:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
how we do that
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
um and when and when they're not there
 
05:23:24.350 --> 05:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
then each parent is basically dealing
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
with their child in their own home
 
05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
correct and so this is an oven and up
 
05:23:29.690 --> 05:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
this would be another opportunity for
 
05:23:32.330 --> 05:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
them to come and socialize okay correct
 
05:23:33.490 --> 05:23:33.500 align:start position:0%
thanks for that clarification
 
05:23:36.830 --> 05:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative did you have a question I
 
05:23:38.330 --> 05:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
thought I saw you
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay represent Belcher
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:23:44.330 --> 05:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
your testimony you actually you brought
 
05:23:45.650 --> 05:23:45.660 align:start position:0%
up an interesting
 
05:23:47.270 --> 05:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
point on the interpretation of the
 
05:23:48.590 --> 05:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
language and I want to just look at this
 
05:23:50.030 --> 05:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
just for a sec to see what you think of
 
05:23:52.070 --> 05:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
this since you're the State Board of
 
05:23:54.708 --> 05:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
Education she'll adopt rules pursuant to
 
05:23:56.270 --> 05:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
the RSA relative to the approval of
 
05:23:58.250 --> 05:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
alternate programs for granting credit
 
05:24:00.650 --> 05:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
leading to graduation granting credit
 
05:24:02.448 --> 05:24:02.458 align:start position:0%
leading graduation it doesn't say
 
05:24:05.030 --> 05:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
anything specifically in there about
 
05:24:09.170 --> 05:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
receiving any funding does it so is it
 
05:24:10.850 --> 05:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
not clear to you that this wouldn't
 
05:24:13.368 --> 05:24:13.378 align:start position:0%
apply to you this might apply to me
 
05:24:15.128 --> 05:24:15.138 align:start position:0%
because if we're applying a certain
 
05:24:17.690 --> 05:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
Cooperative teaching we're going to be
 
05:24:19.850 --> 05:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
giving them some type of benefit because
 
05:24:22.430 --> 05:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
we apply our own diploma if we choose to
 
05:24:25.310 --> 05:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
continue through 12th grade thank you
 
05:24:28.250 --> 05:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:24:30.890 --> 05:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh Ken

speaking which is why I prepared a
 
05:25:27.530 --> 05:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
little something before I came in here
 
05:25:29.208 --> 05:25:29.218 align:start position:0%

um I also agree that it's a slippery
 
05:25:43.500 --> 05:25:44.448 align:start position:0%
um I also agree that it's a slippery
slope

05:25:44.448 --> 05:25:44.458 align:start position:0%
slope
 
05:25:46.910 --> 05:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
um this this bill doesn't really Define
 
05:25:50.208 --> 05:25:50.218 align:start position:0%
homeschool program it doesn't reference
 
05:25:52.190 --> 05:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
another build for the purposes of
 
05:25:54.530 --> 05:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
defining homeschool program
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
um it's and
 
05:25:58.788 --> 05:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
um there's some other language that's
 
05:25:58.798 --> 05:26:00.470 align:start position:0%
um there's some other language that's
vague

05:26:00.470 --> 05:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
vague
 
05:26:00.480 --> 05:26:01.190 align:start position:0%

05:26:12.350 --> 05:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
don't collect funds
 
05:26:12.360 --> 05:26:13.910 align:start position:0%
don't collect funds
um

05:26:13.910 --> 05:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:13.920 --> 05:26:24.110 align:start position:0%
um
uh

05:26:24.110 --> 05:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:24.120 --> 05:26:27.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:26:27.350 --> 05:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
if you have uh testimony on your
 
05:26:31.010 --> 05:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
computer if you can get it up you can
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
come back up and read that would be
 
05:26:34.070 --> 05:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
awesome yeah I think I could get it out
 
05:26:38.208 --> 05:26:38.218 align:start position:0%
okay yeah take care all right KJ
 
05:26:40.190 --> 05:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
05:26:42.288 --> 05:26:42.298 align:start position:0%
must be Murphy's Law because I just got
 
05:26:43.430 --> 05:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
something in my eye so if I start
 
05:26:44.990 --> 05:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
blinking it's because I got something in
 
05:26:47.930 --> 05:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
my eye so I seem to have a run a bad
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
luck here
 
05:26:51.110 --> 05:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
um so um thank you for hearing me today
 
05:26:52.368 --> 05:26:52.378 align:start position:0%
I'll be very brief and thank you for
 
05:26:54.350 --> 05:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
bumping me up I have to head out to uh
 
05:26:55.850 --> 05:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
do something with my child
 
05:26:57.890 --> 05:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
um so I'm here to oppose this bill um
 
05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
who am I I'm a mom of four children
 
05:27:02.990 --> 05:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
um I have a special needs volunteer
 
05:27:04.368 --> 05:27:04.378 align:start position:0%
educational advocate for children's
 
05:27:06.110 --> 05:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
estate with special needs and also a
 
05:27:08.330 --> 05:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
founder of a non-partisan advocacy team
 
05:27:09.948 --> 05:27:09.958 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
05:27:11.270 --> 05:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
um a group of moms that have gotten
 
05:27:12.590 --> 05:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
together through our hard times and come
 
05:27:14.330 --> 05:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
together to find solutions to help
 
05:27:16.850 --> 05:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
ourselves and others I have two children
 
05:27:18.890 --> 05:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
that are in Vlogs and pair that nicely
 
05:27:20.750 --> 05:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
with Kai the kai program you may have
 
05:27:23.390 --> 05:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
heard about I have two others in Brenda
 
05:27:26.030 --> 05:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
we can't qualify for an EFA but we do
 
05:27:28.310 --> 05:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
utilize educational scholarships
 
05:27:30.590 --> 05:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
so as they thought about this bill it
 
05:27:32.330 --> 05:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
really hung over me like a dark cloud
 
05:27:34.850 --> 05:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
because if you knew the stories of the
 
05:27:37.368 --> 05:27:37.378 align:start position:0%
people myself and others included that
 
05:27:39.050 --> 05:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
have come here many times in front of
 
05:27:40.788 --> 05:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
the education committee
 
05:27:42.830 --> 05:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
to beg for options for our kids in the
 
05:27:44.448 --> 05:27:44.458 align:start position:0%
state you'll know that you know like I
 
05:27:46.010 --> 05:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
said it's it's a non-partisan matter
 
05:27:48.410 --> 05:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
this transcends politics really it
 
05:27:51.948 --> 05:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
should and to me this bill came across
 
05:27:54.770 --> 05:27:54.780 align:start position:0%
with bad motivations and is sort of
 
05:27:56.510 --> 05:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
tandemount to a bit of harassment and
 
05:27:57.770 --> 05:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
you heard that from some of the prior
 
05:27:57.780 --> 05:27:59.050 align:start position:0%
you heard that from some of the prior
speakers

05:27:59.050 --> 05:27:59.060 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
05:28:02.330 --> 05:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
who does it impact uh use cases could
 
05:28:04.730 --> 05:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
impact we heard from parents using our
 
05:28:06.470 --> 05:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
vendors for learning loss such as
 
05:28:08.270 --> 05:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves coming out of pandemic we were
 
05:28:09.890 --> 05:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
able to get a scholarship
 
05:28:11.868 --> 05:28:11.878 align:start position:0%
and after years of struggles in the
 
05:28:13.610 --> 05:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
regular school system we had to look for
 
05:28:15.470 --> 05:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
other options with three kids on an IEP
 
05:28:17.570 --> 05:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
myself a single mom working full-time
 
05:28:20.510 --> 05:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
with 200 blood pressure it was not an
 
05:28:22.128 --> 05:28:22.138 align:start position:0%
option for me anymore to be stressing
 
05:28:23.510 --> 05:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
myself and I had to find another
 
05:28:25.610 --> 05:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
solution for them
 
05:28:28.490 --> 05:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
um so we do utilize these options and
 
05:28:30.650 --> 05:28:30.660 align:start position:0%
the the logic in this bill right now is
 
05:28:32.570 --> 05:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
kind of all over the place I was pre-law
 
05:28:34.310 --> 05:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
in school I have a major in that
 
05:28:35.930 --> 05:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
although I'm an I.T now and I see this
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
as a proverbial slippery slope it's it's
 
05:28:40.750 --> 05:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
an enormous slippery slope here
 
05:28:43.368 --> 05:28:43.378 align:start position:0%
we've seen how even with background
 
05:28:44.930 --> 05:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
checks in our schools
 
05:28:46.970 --> 05:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to do a liquor good right
 
05:28:48.830 --> 05:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
you just heard it in the news Timberlane
 
05:28:52.070 --> 05:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
Brentwood plastow I mean the articles
 
05:28:53.570 --> 05:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
are almost in the news Every Day
 
05:28:56.090 --> 05:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
background checks are not a complete
 
05:28:58.190 --> 05:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
safety catch for this kind of behavior
 
05:29:00.050 --> 05:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
by Bad actors
 
05:29:02.090 --> 05:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
okay so this bill is not reasonable it
 
05:29:04.628 --> 05:29:04.638 align:start position:0%
seems punitive and it seems ineffective
 
05:29:06.830 --> 05:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
and it's adding a burden it's adding
 
05:29:08.750 --> 05:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
expense and it's not answering questions
 
05:29:11.270 --> 05:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
about who would administer it does there
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
need to be another branch of government
 
05:29:13.910 --> 05:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
to administer all these background
 
05:29:15.288 --> 05:29:15.298 align:start position:0%
checks and then what do you do with them
 
05:29:16.850 --> 05:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
and who passes a background check who
 
05:29:18.590 --> 05:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass a background check
 
05:29:21.410 --> 05:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
the questions are endless here right
 
05:29:23.890 --> 05:29:23.900 align:start position:0%
what I see is a big difference is that
 
05:29:26.868 --> 05:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
regardless of the money the parent and
 
05:29:29.448 --> 05:29:29.458 align:start position:0%
not the state is truly in charge here so
 
05:29:30.890 --> 05:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
like you heard another example is if my
 
05:29:32.090 --> 05:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
child at the park am I going to
 
05:29:33.288 --> 05:29:33.298 align:start position:0%
background check everybody at the park
 
05:29:35.628 --> 05:29:35.638 align:start position:0%
no my child's in a printer pot am I
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
going to background every everyone that
 
05:29:38.030 --> 05:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
comes through the door no not
 
05:29:39.650 --> 05:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
necessarily I take that responsibility
 
05:29:42.708 --> 05:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
for my children my family
 
05:29:44.330 --> 05:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
and are the people really asking for
 
05:29:45.708 --> 05:29:45.718 align:start position:0%
this let's go back to my point about
 
05:29:47.810 --> 05:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
this seems like it's in bad faith who's
 
05:29:51.050 --> 05:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
asking for this who's behind us who
 
05:29:52.490 --> 05:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
really wants this did the general public
 
05:29:53.750 --> 05:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
want it because I can tell you or
 
05:29:55.850 --> 05:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
represent both sides and in this
 
05:29:58.490 --> 05:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
non-partisan group and they don't want
 
05:30:00.110 --> 05:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
any of this no one's asking for it it's
 
05:30:03.470 --> 05:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
not doing any good so this just begs a
 
05:30:05.330 --> 05:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
lot of questions it's the proverbial
 
05:30:07.368 --> 05:30:07.378 align:start position:0%
slippery slope again it doesn't seem
 
05:30:07.378 --> 05:30:08.448 align:start position:0%
slippery slope again it doesn't seem
reasonable

05:30:08.448 --> 05:30:08.458 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
05:30:09.948 --> 05:30:09.958 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem like we have a current
 
05:30:09.958 --> 05:30:10.970 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem like we have a current
issue

05:30:10.970 --> 05:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:30:13.490 --> 05:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
we have other measures we have mandatory
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
reporting which we heard about we have
 
05:30:17.628 --> 05:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
people getting put on a child predator
 
05:30:19.850 --> 05:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
list right we've got those lists we know
 
05:30:21.650 --> 05:30:21.660 align:start position:0%
who those people are I mean I know who
 
05:30:23.270 --> 05:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
is around my neighborhood that's for
 
05:30:25.850 --> 05:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
sure if there's anyone close by so it's
 
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
up to me the parent to put my child
 
05:30:30.650 --> 05:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
somewhere safe at the end of the day so
 
05:30:32.690 --> 05:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary it's frivolous it's
 
05:30:32.700 --> 05:30:33.890 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary it's frivolous it's
burdensome

05:30:33.890 --> 05:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
burdensome
 
05:30:36.530 --> 05:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
it won't go on but I urge you to oppose
 
05:30:38.810 --> 05:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
this bill I mean my goodness what's the
 
05:30:39.708 --> 05:30:39.718 align:start position:0%
next thing are we going to have a
 
05:30:41.390 --> 05:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
Chinese balloon in our backyard you know
 
05:30:44.030 --> 05:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
floating overhead honestly just it
 
05:30:46.190 --> 05:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop right and when we start to
 
05:30:48.410 --> 05:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
get into these gray mushy areas there's
 
05:30:50.990 --> 05:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
no end so I ask you to oppose this bill
 
05:30:52.788 --> 05:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your time I'll send you
 
05:30:54.590 --> 05:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
my electronic testimony thank you all
 
05:30:55.970 --> 05:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any

represent Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
05:31:02.448 --> 05:31:02.458 align:start position:0%
very briefly I know you weren't law
 
05:31:04.730 --> 05:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
pre-loved so maybe maybe you can answer
 
05:31:04.740 --> 05:31:06.788 align:start position:0%
pre-loved so maybe maybe you can answer
this

05:31:06.788 --> 05:31:06.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:31:09.708 --> 05:31:09.718 align:start position:0%
can you think of any any time in in
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
American history any other right in the
 
05:31:13.250 --> 05:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
First Amendment such as speech assembly
 
05:31:15.530 --> 05:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
has been burdened by the need to ask
 
05:31:16.670 --> 05:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
government permission or get a
 
05:31:18.590 --> 05:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
background check
 
05:31:20.810 --> 05:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
I know it's been tried many times right
 
05:31:23.990 --> 05:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
but no the answer is no we have those
 
05:31:26.270 --> 05:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
rights are covered by overarching rights
 
05:31:27.708 --> 05:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
that we live under in this country where
 
05:31:30.288 --> 05:31:30.298 align:start position:0%
we're free so no I believe no
 
05:31:32.570 --> 05:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
does that answer okay thank you thank
 
05:31:35.208 --> 05:31:35.218 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much

05:31:53.570 --> 05:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
daughters thank you for your hard work
 
05:31:55.070 --> 05:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
on the education committee I'm here to
 
05:31:58.250 --> 05:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote no on this bill hb628
 
05:32:00.110 --> 05:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
as criminal background checks are not
 
05:32:01.850 --> 05:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
necessary for homeschool families
 
05:32:04.610 --> 05:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
seeking educational tax credits
 
05:32:06.650 --> 05:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
do parents need a criminal background
 
05:32:08.990 --> 05:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
check to claim a child as an exemption
 
05:32:12.288 --> 05:32:12.298 align:start position:0%
or deduction on their tax return no
 
05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
our criminal background checks required
 
05:32:16.490 --> 05:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
for any other parental tax advantage
 
05:32:20.750 --> 05:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
nope having a child in one's home has a
 
05:32:22.550 --> 05:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
profound impact on Ultimate tax
 
05:32:25.128 --> 05:32:25.138 align:start position:0%
liability yet we never require a
 
05:32:26.570 --> 05:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
background check
 
05:32:28.970 --> 05:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
what is the logic for abruptly targeting
 
05:32:32.090 --> 05:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
just this one tax credit there is none
 
05:32:34.610 --> 05:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
please vote no on this Bill thank you
 
05:32:37.310 --> 05:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions
 
05:32:43.430 --> 05:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:45.110 --> 05:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
let me know if I pronounce your last
 
05:32:48.350 --> 05:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
name incorrectly Roar Bacher okay
 
05:32:50.448 --> 05:32:50.458 align:start position:0%

05:32:52.970 --> 05:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me today my name
 
05:32:54.590 --> 05:32:54.600 align:start position:0%

05:33:03.830 --> 05:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:33:07.850 --> 05:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
um I am here today as an independent
 
05:33:10.368 --> 05:33:10.378 align:start position:0%
homeschooler we do not receive any
 
05:33:12.590 --> 05:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
federal monies for our home education
 
05:33:14.810 --> 05:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
program we do participate in the
 
05:33:17.510 --> 05:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
education tax credit scholarship
 
05:33:19.128 --> 05:33:19.138 align:start position:0%
that does not however affect our
 
05:33:20.690 --> 05:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
homeschooling status and we are still
 
05:33:20.700 --> 05:33:23.510 align:start position:0%
homeschooling status and we are still
independent

05:33:23.510 --> 05:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:25.010 --> 05:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
um I choose the curriculum and service
 
05:33:28.010 --> 05:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
providers that are best suited to meet
 
05:33:29.570 --> 05:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
the educational needs and goals of each
 
05:33:31.010 --> 05:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
of our children
 
05:33:32.868 --> 05:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
over the last 12 and a half years some
 
05:33:34.430 --> 05:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
subjects have been taught by me directly
 
05:33:36.530 --> 05:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
While others have been broadened by
 
05:33:38.090 --> 05:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
friends and professionals that we've
 
05:33:38.100 --> 05:33:39.288 align:start position:0%
friends and professionals that we've
selected

05:33:39.288 --> 05:33:39.298 align:start position:0%
selected
 
05:33:42.650 --> 05:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
as one presenter already said math is
 
05:33:44.208 --> 05:33:44.218 align:start position:0%
not my strong suit but I have a very
 
05:33:45.948 --> 05:33:45.958 align:start position:0%
good friend who has taught math in the
 
05:33:48.288 --> 05:33:48.298 align:start position:0%
past and she has wonderfully helped in
 
05:33:50.570 --> 05:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
that Realm
 
05:33:52.190 --> 05:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
as a homeschooling family we have many
 
05:33:54.110 --> 05:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities for activity and service
 
05:33:55.490 --> 05:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
within our community
 
05:33:58.010 --> 05:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
and over the last several years I have
 
05:34:00.410 --> 05:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
myself participated in many of these
 
05:34:02.750 --> 05:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
activities and in my capacities as a
 
05:34:05.510 --> 05:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer with these organizations they
 
05:34:07.010 --> 05:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
have required criminal background checks
 
05:34:09.010 --> 05:34:09.020 align:start position:0%
of me which is perfectly reasonable
 
05:34:12.410 --> 05:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
because they as an organization are the
 
05:34:14.810 --> 05:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
05:34:16.970 --> 05:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
I've served in my church nursery
 
05:34:21.050 --> 05:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
in a nursery for another church in 4-H
 
05:34:25.128 --> 05:34:25.138 align:start position:0%
in the Good News Club
 
05:34:27.590 --> 05:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
at a family camp in the state
 
05:34:30.050 --> 05:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
and most recently in my capacities with
 
05:34:31.910 --> 05:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
American Heritage Girls
 
05:34:33.948 --> 05:34:33.958 align:start position:0%
all of those programs have required a
 
05:34:35.390 --> 05:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
criminal background check
 
05:34:37.610 --> 05:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
each of those programs has provided that
 
05:34:39.288 --> 05:34:39.298 align:start position:0%
criminal background check to satisfy
 
05:34:42.170 --> 05:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:44.868 --> 05:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
there is a no funding mechanism for this
 
05:34:44.878 --> 05:34:48.110 align:start position:0%
there is a no funding mechanism for this
bill

05:34:48.110 --> 05:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:51.770 --> 05:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
who is to say who will acquire the
 
05:34:53.208 --> 05:34:53.218 align:start position:0%
background check
 
05:34:55.810 --> 05:34:55.820 align:start position:0%
who is to say what the implications are
 
05:34:59.708 --> 05:34:59.718 align:start position:0%
if a service provider or parent does not
 
05:35:02.930 --> 05:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
satisfy the background check
 
05:35:06.470 --> 05:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
this is an overreach
 
05:35:08.690 --> 05:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
05:35:11.330 --> 05:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
any questions yes represent cordelli uh
 
05:35:13.550 --> 05:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for being here
 
05:35:13.560 --> 05:35:14.090 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for being here
um

05:35:14.090 --> 05:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:16.368 --> 05:35:16.378 align:start position:0%
your friend uh came in and taught you
 
05:35:18.770 --> 05:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
math as I understand it or taught your
 
05:35:21.350 --> 05:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
kids math I should say Yes
 
05:35:23.150 --> 05:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
um maybe she should teach me some math
 
05:35:23.160 --> 05:35:24.470 align:start position:0%
um maybe she should teach me some math
too

05:35:24.470 --> 05:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:35:24.480 --> 05:35:25.250 align:start position:0%
too
um

05:35:25.250 --> 05:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:28.490 --> 05:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
under your reading of this bill would it
 
05:35:31.490 --> 05:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
require that you had your friend get a
 
05:35:33.590 --> 05:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
background check or that somehow you
 
05:35:35.750 --> 05:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
initiated a background check for your
 
05:35:37.850 --> 05:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
friend under this bill I don't see a
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism that states that my friend
 
05:35:41.810 --> 05:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
would be exempt we have also
 
05:35:44.270 --> 05:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
participated in Co-op settings like
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
other families here today
 
05:35:48.288 --> 05:35:48.298 align:start position:0%
and there is no mechanism to state that
 
05:35:50.510 --> 05:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
those families would be exempt I have
 
05:35:53.150 --> 05:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
taught other families children physics
 
05:35:54.890 --> 05:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
would I be needing a background check to
 
05:35:56.270 --> 05:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
do so
 
05:36:00.410 --> 05:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:02.030 --> 05:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
further questions represent Belcher
 
05:36:03.650 --> 05:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:36:05.810 --> 05:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
your testimony you brought up I think a
 
05:36:07.550 --> 05:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
really really good point that I hadn't
 
05:36:09.410 --> 05:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
thought about so
 
05:36:11.208 --> 05:36:11.218 align:start position:0%
we live in a society obviously it's
 
05:36:13.128 --> 05:36:13.138 align:start position:0%
imperfect sometimes people do bad things
 
05:36:15.470 --> 05:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes they or debt to society they
 
05:36:17.810 --> 05:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
pay it we give Grace
 
05:36:20.930 --> 05:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
and sometimes those are parents
 
05:36:23.090 --> 05:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
so what do you think would happen how
 
05:36:24.590 --> 05:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
would the state enforce if a parent
 
05:36:26.990 --> 05:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
failed the background check
 
05:36:29.270 --> 05:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
for their own child
 
05:36:32.030 --> 05:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
05:36:34.250 --> 05:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:36:36.530 --> 05:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:36:39.288 --> 05:36:39.298 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:36:45.530 --> 05:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:47.628 --> 05:36:47.638 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you committee
 
05:36:52.090 --> 05:36:52.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:55.550 --> 05:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you for all of your very
 
05:36:58.128 --> 05:36:58.138 align:start position:0%
conscious questions they that's what's
 
05:37:00.050 --> 05:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
made me so impassioned about spoke
 
05:37:02.208 --> 05:37:02.218 align:start position:0%
speaking about this bill
 
05:37:02.218 --> 05:37:03.110 align:start position:0%
speaking about this bill
um

05:37:03.110 --> 05:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:06.650 --> 05:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
I as you may know I am I do not have any
 
05:37:09.050 --> 05:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
children currently in school but I did
 
05:37:10.850 --> 05:37:10.860 align:start position:0%
have children that I wanted to
 
05:37:13.610 --> 05:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
homeschool and I felt I was not capable
 
05:37:15.708 --> 05:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
of homeschooling
 
05:37:18.170 --> 05:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
um because I felt I was not capable of
 
05:37:21.050 --> 05:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
homeschooling I had a child who was
 
05:37:23.570 --> 05:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
physically abused in our public school
 
05:37:27.230 --> 05:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
system by one of their teachers so I
 
05:37:29.390 --> 05:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
chose to remove that child from the
 
05:37:31.550 --> 05:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
school system and
 
05:37:34.310 --> 05:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
pay for private education without Public
 
05:37:36.650 --> 05:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
Funding because during my investigation
 
05:37:40.430 --> 05:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
I found that this teacher had been moved
 
05:37:43.610 --> 05:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
12 times within the last four years
 
05:37:46.190 --> 05:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
because of parental's comp parents
 
05:37:46.200 --> 05:37:48.170 align:start position:0%
because of parental's comp parents
complaints

05:37:48.170 --> 05:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
05:37:51.770 --> 05:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
she had a glowing history she had been a
 
05:37:54.050 --> 05:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
teacher for over tomorrow's counselor or
 
05:37:56.750 --> 05:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
whatever for a long time in our school
 
05:37:59.448 --> 05:37:59.458 align:start position:0%
systems and she was physically abusing
 
05:38:02.090 --> 05:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
multiple children
 
05:38:04.730 --> 05:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
never had a problem with her background
 
05:38:04.740 --> 05:38:05.930 align:start position:0%
never had a problem with her background
check

05:38:05.930 --> 05:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
check
 
05:38:09.948 --> 05:38:09.958 align:start position:0%
so this bill does not address that
 
05:38:13.550 --> 05:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is is we have we have
 
05:38:13.560 --> 05:38:14.990 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is is we have we have
people

05:38:14.990 --> 05:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:38:18.110 --> 05:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
that for whatever reason choose to do
 
05:38:21.708 --> 05:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
bad things and they will seek out places
 
05:38:25.490 --> 05:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
that their victims most oftenly frequent
 
05:38:28.368 --> 05:38:28.378 align:start position:0%
so we have a problem in the fact that
 
05:38:31.910 --> 05:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
our public schools are ripe
 
05:38:36.470 --> 05:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
for evil our our counseling systems our
 
05:38:38.448 --> 05:38:38.458 align:start position:0%
after-school programs our coaching
 
05:38:42.230 --> 05:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
programs we as parents need to have the
 
05:38:45.470 --> 05:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
ability to to develop relationships with
 
05:38:48.708 --> 05:38:48.718 align:start position:0%
people within all of these venues so
 
05:38:51.230 --> 05:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
that we can trust them again because
 
05:38:53.270 --> 05:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
that trust has been lost and that's very
 
05:38:53.280 --> 05:38:55.310 align:start position:0%
that trust has been lost and that's very
clear

05:38:55.310 --> 05:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:38:58.128 --> 05:38:58.138 align:start position:0%
with regards to this bill I've heard a
 
05:38:59.930 --> 05:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
lot of folks say that this is a slippery
 
05:39:02.030 --> 05:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
slope I would say it's much more than a
 
05:39:04.390 --> 05:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
slippery slope this is a discrimination
 
05:39:07.430 --> 05:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
practice this bill is extremely
 
05:39:10.610 --> 05:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
discriminatory the fact that this bill
 
05:39:15.050 --> 05:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
would allow the government to withhold
 
05:39:18.350 --> 05:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
funds because of someone's bad choices
 
05:39:22.550 --> 05:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
before they had children unacceptable
 
05:39:24.770 --> 05:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
what would this do I loved
 
05:39:26.750 --> 05:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative belcher's comment what
 
05:39:28.670 --> 05:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
would this do if if it came back that
 
05:39:32.628 --> 05:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
the parents had a criminal background
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
would they have to report it to DHHS or
 
05:39:38.208 --> 05:39:38.218 align:start position:0%
to dcyf let me tell you I worked for
 
05:39:41.390 --> 05:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
dcyf and a lot of teachers a lot of
 
05:39:43.250 --> 05:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
people in the school systems a lot of
 
05:39:46.310 --> 05:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
Administrators if they got a bad
 
05:39:49.670 --> 05:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
background checked on a parent I have no
 
05:39:51.890 --> 05:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
doubt that they would file a report of
 
05:39:54.170 --> 05:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and that would be not
 
05:39:54.180 --> 05:39:56.150 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and that would be not
appropriate

05:39:56.150 --> 05:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:39:59.330 --> 05:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
because we should not judge people by
 
05:40:01.610 --> 05:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
their past we need to judge people by
 
05:40:04.190 --> 05:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
what they are today isn't that what our
 
05:40:06.530 --> 05:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
society is all about we've all made
 
05:40:06.540 --> 05:40:07.730 align:start position:0%
society is all about we've all made
mistakes

05:40:07.730 --> 05:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
05:40:10.128 --> 05:40:10.138 align:start position:0%
we can cut lit we can rise from those
 
05:40:13.670 --> 05:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
mistakes this bill says if you made a
 
05:40:16.250 --> 05:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
mistake when you were 18 years old and
 
05:40:21.470 --> 05:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
and you um did your time and now you're
 
05:40:25.190 --> 05:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:27.650 --> 05:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
that background check could preclude you
 
05:40:29.330 --> 05:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
from going on a field trip with your
 
05:40:29.340 --> 05:40:30.890 align:start position:0%
from going on a field trip with your
child

05:40:30.890 --> 05:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:40:33.830 --> 05:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
that background check could preclude you
 
05:40:35.750 --> 05:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
from being a coach for an honestly the
 
05:40:38.750 --> 05:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
Mind program or a first program or even
 
05:40:41.390 --> 05:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
driving you your children and their
 
05:40:44.570 --> 05:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
friends to an after-school facility the
 
05:40:46.850 --> 05:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
other thing that's very very very
 
05:40:48.590 --> 05:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
concerning and it should be just
 
05:40:51.050 --> 05:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
concerned as concerning for both sides
 
05:40:52.670 --> 05:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
of the equation
 
05:40:56.410 --> 05:40:56.420 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to happen
 
05:40:58.910 --> 05:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
and it were to be
 
05:41:01.910 --> 05:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
every single provider that were to come
 
05:41:05.448 --> 05:41:05.458 align:start position:0%
in contact with a child in in whether it
 
05:41:08.030 --> 05:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
be Public School whether it be private
 
05:41:10.310 --> 05:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
school whether it be apprenda regardless
 
05:41:13.788 --> 05:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
this should also include the curriculum
 
05:41:16.270 --> 05:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
that's being taught should it not
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
maybe if a bill like this were to were
 
05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
to actually pass maybe we should start
 
05:41:26.150 --> 05:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the curriculum and those
 
05:41:26.160 --> 05:41:27.650 align:start position:0%
looking at the curriculum and those
authors

05:41:27.650 --> 05:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
authors
 
05:41:30.110 --> 05:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
the authors that are being that our
 
05:41:32.690 --> 05:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
children are being forced to read
 
05:41:36.230 --> 05:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
these these after school programs that
 
05:41:38.690 --> 05:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
our children are being encouraged to
 
05:41:38.700 --> 05:41:41.270 align:start position:0%
our children are being encouraged to
attend

05:41:41.270 --> 05:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:44.810 --> 05:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:47.750 --> 05:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinics they're during school
 
05:41:50.690 --> 05:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
hours everything that every person every
 
05:41:52.310 --> 05:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
person that comes in contact with those
 
05:41:53.990 --> 05:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
children should they have a background
 
05:41:56.208 --> 05:41:56.218 align:start position:0%
check that's the kind of thing that this
 
05:41:58.070 --> 05:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
bill is talking about
 
05:42:01.070 --> 05:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
and it's unacceptable bottom line is is
 
05:42:04.190 --> 05:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
that we should not under any
 
05:42:07.128 --> 05:42:07.138 align:start position:0%
circumstances allow the government to
 
05:42:09.970 --> 05:42:09.980 align:start position:0%
control what goes on with our children
 
05:42:13.070 --> 05:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
without parents permission and consent
 
05:42:15.410 --> 05:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
there is nothing stopping any parent
 
05:42:17.448 --> 05:42:17.458 align:start position:0%
from getting a criminal record check
 
05:42:19.128 --> 05:42:19.138 align:start position:0%
done individually
 
05:42:21.890 --> 05:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
the government coming into this and
 
05:42:24.288 --> 05:42:24.298 align:start position:0%
saying well we're going to do it if you
 
05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
want our money then we're going to
 
05:42:29.090 --> 05:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
control you unacceptable completely and
 
05:42:31.810 --> 05:42:31.820 align:start position:0%
totally unacceptable
 
05:42:35.448 --> 05:42:35.458 align:start position:0%
this this actually targets are
 
05:42:38.690 --> 05:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
underprivileged it targets our parents
 
05:42:41.628 --> 05:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
who have special ed kids who may have
 
05:42:44.030 --> 05:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
made a mistake during the during the
 
05:42:46.250 --> 05:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
their tenure in their school system who
 
05:42:48.350 --> 05:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
may have been overwhelmed and made a
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
mistake and has a child abuse and
 
05:42:52.730 --> 05:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
neglect on their record
 
05:42:54.350 --> 05:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
does that mean they're going to do it
 
05:42:56.208 --> 05:42:56.218 align:start position:0%
again does that mean they're going to do
 
05:42:59.270 --> 05:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
it 10 people make mistakes
 
05:43:04.190 --> 05:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
this bill puts every single parent every
 
05:43:06.670 --> 05:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
single person working with the children
 
05:43:10.010 --> 05:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
in a position that says you will be
 
05:43:13.070 --> 05:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
Unforgiven and that's unacceptable thank
 
05:43:14.448 --> 05:43:14.458 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much are there any
 
05:43:16.128 --> 05:43:16.138 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:43:18.650 --> 05:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
not seeing you thank you very much
 
05:43:26.750 --> 05:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:29.090 --> 05:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me excuse me we got the
 
05:43:33.110 --> 05:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
computer working or do we come on Ken
 
05:43:40.970 --> 05:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:42.470 --> 05:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
fortunately a lot of the points have
 
05:43:46.390 --> 05:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
been made but some of the things
 
05:43:48.770 --> 05:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
some of the things I I wanted to point
 
05:43:51.948 --> 05:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
out is this also um descentifies is it
 
05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
because it incentivizes people uh from
 
05:43:56.750 --> 05:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
joining small co-ops so people can
 
05:43:58.070 --> 05:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
afford necessarily to do these
 
05:44:00.590 --> 05:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
background checks just small groups
 
05:44:03.110 --> 05:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
um it's uh
 
05:44:03.120 --> 05:44:05.590 align:start position:0%
um it's uh
um

05:44:05.590 --> 05:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:08.810 --> 05:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh it's discouraging homeschooling as a
 
05:44:08.820 --> 05:44:09.650 align:start position:0%
uh it's discouraging homeschooling as a
whole

05:44:09.650 --> 05:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
whole
 
05:44:09.660 --> 05:44:11.628 align:start position:0%
whole
um

05:44:11.628 --> 05:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:13.970 --> 05:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
it eliminates those resources as an
 
05:44:15.650 --> 05:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
option for those homeschooling parents
 
05:44:18.170 --> 05:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
which is unacceptable
 
05:44:18.180 --> 05:44:22.128 align:start position:0%
which is unacceptable
um

05:44:22.128 --> 05:44:22.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:24.590 --> 05:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
and many of the people that this would
 
05:44:27.048 --> 05:44:27.058 align:start position:0%
Target are low-income families who rely
 
05:44:29.690 --> 05:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
on these funds and specifically targets
 
05:44:31.490 --> 05:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
them so it is discriminatory it's
 
05:44:33.590 --> 05:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
discriminatory towards uh low-income
 
05:44:33.600 --> 05:44:35.270 align:start position:0%
discriminatory towards uh low-income
people

05:44:35.270 --> 05:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:44:37.730 --> 05:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
um the families
 
05:44:37.740 --> 05:44:40.070 align:start position:0%
um the families
um

05:44:40.070 --> 05:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:42.350 --> 05:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
those are the people who who
 
05:44:47.208 --> 05:44:47.218 align:start position:0%
would need those funds and and um
 
05:44:49.070 --> 05:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
who might get ostracized from
 
05:44:50.330 --> 05:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
communities that couldn't afford to
 
05:44:51.948 --> 05:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
participate in that small co-ops just
 
05:44:53.570 --> 05:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
two families or so three families or so
 
05:44:53.580 --> 05:44:58.128 align:start position:0%
two families or so three families or so
uh

05:44:58.128 --> 05:44:58.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:58.138 --> 05:45:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:45:01.510 --> 05:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:04.430 --> 05:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh the intent is supposedly to protect
 
05:45:07.730 --> 05:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
children uh from potential criminals the
 
05:45:09.170 --> 05:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
thing that comes to mind for me is sex
 
05:45:11.690 --> 05:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
offenders but as has been pointed out is
 
05:45:13.548 --> 05:45:13.558 align:start position:0%
we already have access to public
 
05:45:15.590 --> 05:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
databases where we can determine if
 
05:45:17.750 --> 05:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
someone's a sex offender or not or at
 
05:45:20.208 --> 05:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
least a convicted sex offender or not
 
05:45:24.590 --> 05:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
um so if this bill were intent on
 
05:45:26.150 --> 05:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
protecting those children without
 
05:45:27.770 --> 05:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
bringing harm to these co-ops it could
 
05:45:30.470 --> 05:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
have been written that the co-ops simply
 
05:45:31.448 --> 05:45:31.458 align:start position:0%
have to
 
05:45:33.530 --> 05:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
run these people through it through the
 
05:45:34.970 --> 05:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
background check and potentially report
 
05:45:37.190 --> 05:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
it to the local police departments if
 
05:45:38.930 --> 05:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
they find that some employee was
 
05:45:41.570 --> 05:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere some uh prospective employee
 
05:45:43.250 --> 05:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
was a sex offender
 
05:45:43.260 --> 05:45:45.410 align:start position:0%
was a sex offender
um

05:45:45.410 --> 05:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:47.330 --> 05:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
um so this could be written in a way
 
05:45:49.250 --> 05:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
that doesn't require you know harm
 
05:45:52.190 --> 05:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
against these co-ops
 
05:45:52.200 --> 05:45:55.190 align:start position:0%
against these co-ops
um

05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:57.708 --> 05:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
um there's also um
 
05:46:00.230 --> 05:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
the financial incentive
 
05:46:03.110 --> 05:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
um which is for
 
05:46:05.090 --> 05:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
um the state is gonna is gonna see
 
05:46:07.190 --> 05:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
revenue from background checks
 
05:46:08.990 --> 05:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:46:10.730 --> 05:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
also discourage
 
05:46:12.288 --> 05:46:12.298 align:start position:0%
um people from pursuing these
 
05:46:13.430 --> 05:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
scholarships and potentially
 
05:46:15.110 --> 05:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
homeschooling entirely which puts them
 
05:46:16.190 --> 05:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
back into the public school system
 
05:46:16.200 --> 05:46:18.650 align:start position:0%
back into the public school system
potentially

05:46:18.650 --> 05:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
05:46:20.690 --> 05:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
um and that would be a way for them to
 
05:46:23.030 --> 05:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
cut and expense so I can't ignore those
 
05:46:24.590 --> 05:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
financial incentives
 
05:46:24.600 --> 05:46:25.490 align:start position:0%
financial incentives
um

05:46:25.490 --> 05:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:28.070 --> 05:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
also who is considered a volunteer or
 
05:46:30.590 --> 05:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
employee of the co-op if the co-op goes
 
05:46:32.810 --> 05:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
to let's say a museum
 
05:46:34.788 --> 05:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
um is the person giving lecture there
 
05:46:38.030 --> 05:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know considered a a an employer or a
 
05:46:40.250 --> 05:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
volunteer I mean the the co-op contracts
 
05:46:42.410 --> 05:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
them to provide this resource for the
 
05:46:42.420 --> 05:46:43.788 align:start position:0%
them to provide this resource for the
children

05:46:43.788 --> 05:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:46:45.590 --> 05:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of akin to the staple
 
05:46:47.090 --> 05:46:47.100 align:start position:0%
scenario but it actually in this case
 
05:46:48.948 --> 05:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
they would be providing instruction to
 
05:46:50.868 --> 05:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
the children
 
05:46:50.878 --> 05:46:52.970 align:start position:0%
the children
um

05:46:52.970 --> 05:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:52.980 --> 05:46:56.570 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:46:56.570 --> 05:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:59.750 --> 05:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
I think that'll do it
 
05:47:01.430 --> 05:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:47:04.250 --> 05:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee Nancy thank
 
05:47:09.948 --> 05:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:12.470 --> 05:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
all righty so this will conclude
 
05:47:16.730 --> 05:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:18.410 --> 05:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
and we're going to stand up for a second
 
05:47:20.448 --> 05:47:20.458 align:start position:0%
here and do some stretching
 
05:47:43.010 --> 05:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:47.810 --> 05:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:03.890 --> 05:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:03.900 --> 05:48:20.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:20.160 --> 05:48:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:48:25.670 --> 05:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:27.170 --> 05:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
but it's not
 
05:48:30.590 --> 05:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:40.010 --> 05:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:40.020 --> 05:57:28.788 align:start position:0%
 
what

05:57:28.788 --> 05:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:31.190 --> 05:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
during school board meetings represent
 
05:57:31.200 --> 05:57:32.390 align:start position:0%
during school board meetings represent
Aaron

05:57:32.390 --> 05:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
Aaron
 
05:57:34.850 --> 05:57:34.860 align:start position:0%

glad to see you guys working so hard
 
05:57:40.138 --> 05:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
glad to see you guys working so hard
okay

05:57:42.480 --> 05:57:42.490 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:57:42.490 --> 05:57:45.890 align:start position:0%
okay
[Laughter]

05:57:45.890 --> 05:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:57:47.628 --> 05:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
um so I'm Judy and representative Judy
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
Aaron representing Sullivan District 4
 
05:57:52.490 --> 05:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
which is Acworth Goshen Langdon lemster
 
05:57:55.010 --> 05:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
and Washington and I'm here today to
 
05:57:58.628 --> 05:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
introduce my bill HB 427
 
05:58:02.330 --> 05:58:02.340 align:start position:0%
this Bill establishes requirements for
 
05:58:05.150 --> 05:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
public meetings held by school boards to
 
05:58:07.368 --> 05:58:07.378 align:start position:0%
include a designated time period for
 
05:58:09.350 --> 05:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the public and answers
 
05:58:11.090 --> 05:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
from the school board
 
05:58:13.730 --> 05:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
the bill also allows an attendee of a
 
05:58:15.170 --> 05:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
meeting of the school board to get
 
05:58:16.850 --> 05:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
answers regarding which New Hampshire
 
05:58:19.970 --> 05:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
statute or administrative rule gives the
 
05:58:21.830 --> 05:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
school board the authority to create a
 
05:58:24.548 --> 05:58:24.558 align:start position:0%
school policy or operational procedure
 
05:58:29.330 --> 05:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
while I understand that RSA 189 colon 74
 
05:58:33.288 --> 05:58:33.298 align:start position:0%
was changed last year with SB 410
 
05:58:36.350 --> 05:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
to allow for public comment periods and
 
05:58:38.448 --> 05:58:38.458 align:start position:0%
sets up some rules for school boards to
 
05:58:41.270 --> 05:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
accommodate public comment I believe it
 
05:58:43.368 --> 05:58:43.378 align:start position:0%
still falls short of solving issues that
 
05:58:45.350 --> 05:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
have Arisen regarding questions from the
 
05:58:47.628 --> 05:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
public at these meetings
 
05:58:49.670 --> 05:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
one such problem is the possible
 
05:58:52.610 --> 05:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
inability of the public participants to
 
05:58:54.048 --> 05:58:54.058 align:start position:0%
speak to issues that are not
 
05:58:55.910 --> 05:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
specifically on the meeting agenda
 
05:58:59.090 --> 05:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
another problem is in regard to school
 
05:59:00.890 --> 05:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
board members not answering questions
 
05:59:02.690 --> 05:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
directed to them
 
05:59:04.730 --> 05:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
members of the public should be able to
 
05:59:06.770 --> 05:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
ask any question regarding the education
 
05:59:09.708 --> 05:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
of a child or school policy or any other
 
05:59:11.448 --> 05:59:11.458 align:start position:0%
education issue at these school board
 
05:59:14.270 --> 05:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
meetings they should also be able to ask
 
05:59:17.150 --> 05:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
and get answers about which New
 
05:59:19.190 --> 05:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute or administrative rule
 
05:59:20.810 --> 05:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
gives the school board The Authority
 
05:59:22.610 --> 05:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
described in a school policy or
 
05:59:25.610 --> 05:59:25.620 align:start position:0%
operational procedure one would assume
 
05:59:28.128 --> 05:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
that if a school policy is instituted
 
05:59:30.650 --> 05:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
but the school board would already know
 
05:59:33.110 --> 05:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
where in statute it gives them the
 
05:59:35.448 --> 05:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
authority to make such a policy
 
05:59:37.368 --> 05:59:37.378 align:start position:0%
so I don't buy the idea that school
 
05:59:39.470 --> 05:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
board members would not know what the
 
05:59:43.128 --> 05:59:43.138 align:start position:0%
law requires them to do or not do
 
05:59:44.990 --> 05:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
with the introduction of this bill to
 
05:59:47.330 --> 05:59:47.340 align:start position:0%
your committee I want to First establish
 
05:59:49.490 --> 05:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
that school board members are elected by
 
05:59:51.288 --> 05:59:51.298 align:start position:0%
the voters in their District as per
 
05:59:55.548 --> 05:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
statutes under RSA 671. elections are
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
defined under RSA 652 colon 1 and RSA
 
06:00:03.590 --> 06:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
652 colon 9 because school board members
 
06:00:06.230 --> 06:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
are elected officials they are therefore
 
06:00:08.448 --> 06:00:08.458 align:start position:0%
answerable to the public that they serve
 
06:00:10.368 --> 06:00:10.378 align:start position:0%
as elected officials
 
06:00:13.010 --> 06:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
they are elected to craft policy for the
 
06:00:15.170 --> 06:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
school district and represent their
 
06:00:17.330 --> 06:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
constituents and they must be held
 
06:00:20.510 --> 06:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
accountable to those constituents
 
06:00:22.910 --> 06:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
part of that accountability is to answer
 
06:00:25.490 --> 06:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
the questions posed to them and respond
 
06:00:27.470 --> 06:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
to the concerns of the tax paying
 
06:00:27.480 --> 06:00:31.548 align:start position:0%
to the concerns of the tax paying
constituents

06:00:31.548 --> 06:00:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:33.650 --> 06:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
Jeanette and sometimes ugly situations
 
06:00:35.570 --> 06:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
that have happened in school board
 
06:00:39.230 --> 06:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
meetings across the state in the past
 
06:00:41.750 --> 06:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
some parents and members of the public
 
06:00:44.330 --> 06:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
at large have essentially been shut out
 
06:00:46.070 --> 06:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
of participating in school board
 
06:00:48.890 --> 06:00:48.900 align:start position:0%
meetings have been summarily ignored at
 
06:00:50.990 --> 06:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
these meetings and have not been given
 
06:00:52.368 --> 06:00:52.378 align:start position:0%
their rightful chance to question
 
06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
discuss or voice opinion regarding
 
06:00:58.368 --> 06:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
School Board policy for the schools that
 
06:01:01.128 --> 06:01:01.138 align:start position:0%
they pay for with their taxes
 
06:01:03.890 --> 06:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
this is wrong this is a wrong that must
 
06:01:06.770 --> 06:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
now be statutorily corrected we cannot
 
06:01:08.650 --> 06:01:08.660 align:start position:0%
allow school boards to be
 
06:01:11.330 --> 06:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
dictatorships they are elected to serve
 
06:01:13.670 --> 06:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
the public not ignore them
 
06:01:15.590 --> 06:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
members of the public must be given
 
06:01:17.390 --> 06:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
their time to voice their concerns
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
question and give comment at these
 
06:01:21.110 --> 06:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
school board meetings regarding school
 
06:01:23.750 --> 06:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
policy procedures and any other function
 
06:01:26.930 --> 06:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
the school board performs current law
 
06:01:29.270 --> 06:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
establishes no less than 30 minutes for
 
06:01:32.270 --> 06:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
public comment my bill doesn't establish
 
06:01:34.490 --> 06:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
a time frame but requires sufficient
 
06:01:37.190 --> 06:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
time to be given for public input
 
06:01:39.048 --> 06:01:39.058 align:start position:0%
when questioned about school board
 
06:01:41.990 --> 06:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
policy or the authority of school boards
 
06:01:44.510 --> 06:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
to make certain policies they must also
 
06:01:46.730 --> 06:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
provide an answer to the public
 
06:01:48.590 --> 06:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
it is the right of the citizen to
 
06:01:49.970 --> 06:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
question and receive an answer
 
06:01:52.010 --> 06:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
especially since members of the school
 
06:01:54.048 --> 06:01:54.058 align:start position:0%
board were elected to represent the
 
06:01:56.270 --> 06:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
citizens and these citizens are funding
 
06:01:58.788 --> 06:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
the schools with their tax dollars if an
 
06:02:00.530 --> 06:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
answer is not known at the time of the
 
06:02:03.230 --> 06:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
question then it is not unreasonable to
 
06:02:04.910 --> 06:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
require the school board member or
 
06:02:07.368 --> 06:02:07.378 align:start position:0%
administrator to follow up and provide
 
06:02:10.310 --> 06:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
an answer within five business days
 
06:02:13.430 --> 06:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
again as elected officials and policy
 
06:02:21.590 --> 06:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:23.930 --> 06:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
ation are in order the public should
 
06:02:25.610 --> 06:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
also be made aware through school board
 
06:02:27.170 --> 06:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
minutes which members of the school
 
06:02:29.930 --> 06:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
board refuse to answer questions that is
 
06:02:32.390 --> 06:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
a sure that is sure to be useful
 
06:02:34.250 --> 06:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
information to the voters the next time
 
06:02:36.770 --> 06:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
School Board elections come around but
 
06:02:39.830 --> 06:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
it is also a matter of public record
 
06:02:41.750 --> 06:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
also not unreasonable to ask school
 
06:02:43.788 --> 06:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
board members what administrative rules
 
06:02:45.708 --> 06:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
and state statutes give them the
 
06:02:47.570 --> 06:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
authority to make certain school policy
 
06:02:50.090 --> 06:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
this ensures that school boards are not
 
06:02:51.708 --> 06:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
just doing what they want whenever they
 
06:02:54.708 --> 06:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
want without the authority to do so an
 
06:02:56.208 --> 06:02:56.218 align:start position:0%
elected official should not be giving
 
06:02:58.010 --> 06:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
themselves power and authority where
 
06:02:59.628 --> 06:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
none exists
 
06:03:01.670 --> 06:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that makes good sense as
 
06:03:04.190 --> 06:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
it requires that the public be heard
 
06:03:06.288 --> 06:03:06.298 align:start position:0%
it also allows the public input into
 
06:03:09.530 --> 06:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
important local policy making and holds
 
06:03:11.810 --> 06:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
elected officials accountable
 
06:03:14.090 --> 06:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
so I hope that you'll pass this bill out
 
06:03:15.288 --> 06:03:15.298 align:start position:0%
of your committee with an OTP
 
06:03:17.208 --> 06:03:17.218 align:start position:0%
recommendation and I'd be happy to
 
06:03:22.730 --> 06:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:24.650 --> 06:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:03:27.170 --> 06:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
your presentation and for taking my
 
06:03:27.180 --> 06:03:28.090 align:start position:0%
your presentation and for taking my
question

06:03:28.090 --> 06:03:28.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:03:32.030 --> 06:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
with these regulations in in our areas
 
06:03:34.850 --> 06:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
it is very difficult to get people to
 
06:03:37.788 --> 06:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
run for public office particularly as
 
06:03:40.310 --> 06:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
school board just speaking from my
 
06:03:40.320 --> 06:03:41.628 align:start position:0%
school board just speaking from my
experience

06:03:41.628 --> 06:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
experience
 
06:03:45.770 --> 06:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
would this allow for people to be apt to
 
06:03:48.530 --> 06:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
with their would this precipitate no
 
06:03:50.390 --> 06:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's not the word I want would this
 
06:03:53.570 --> 06:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
engage people to want to be on school
 
06:03:57.770 --> 06:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
boards or would it deter them from it
 
06:03:59.448 --> 06:03:59.458 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would deter them from
 
06:04:00.830 --> 06:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
it I think that if you're going to run
 
06:04:03.830 --> 06:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
for an office that you would be welcome
 
06:04:03.840 --> 06:04:05.090 align:start position:0%
for an office that you would be welcome
to

06:04:05.090 --> 06:04:05.100 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:04:05.100 --> 06:04:06.110 align:start position:0%
to
um

06:04:06.110 --> 06:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:09.170 --> 06:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
giving reasons why you make certain
 
06:04:11.990 --> 06:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
policy decisions and that you would
 
06:04:15.230 --> 06:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
welcome questions from the public and
 
06:04:17.510 --> 06:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
that you would want to answer those
 
06:04:20.208 --> 06:04:20.218 align:start position:0%
questions in the best way possible
 
06:04:22.310 --> 06:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
06:04:24.708 --> 06:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
06:04:27.770 --> 06:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr chair
 
06:04:29.270 --> 06:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you for bringing this bill
 
06:04:29.280 --> 06:04:30.590 align:start position:0%
and thank you for bringing this bill
forward

06:04:30.590 --> 06:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
forward
 
06:04:33.948 --> 06:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
I love the intent I have a couple little
 
06:04:35.448 --> 06:04:35.458 align:start position:0%
concerns and I'm hoping you can help
 
06:04:38.390 --> 06:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
ease them about some of the specifics
 
06:04:40.430 --> 06:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
um so when it says that the school board
 
06:04:42.770 --> 06:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
is unable to respond affirmatively that
 
06:04:44.690 --> 06:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
they should then immediately have to
 
06:04:48.048 --> 06:04:48.058 align:start position:0%
withdraw the procedure or rule until
 
06:04:50.090 --> 06:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
they can
 
06:04:52.490 --> 06:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
um is it possible can you can you
 
06:04:54.170 --> 06:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
imagine any scenario where something
 
06:04:58.368 --> 06:04:58.378 align:start position:0%
small mundane even but necessary hasn't
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
been specifically delegated by this body
 
06:05:03.230 --> 06:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
but it's something that could impact
 
06:05:03.240 --> 06:05:06.410 align:start position:0%
but it's something that could impact
operations

06:05:06.410 --> 06:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:08.690 --> 06:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
don't know that I could think of a of
 
06:05:11.390 --> 06:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
anything in particular okay
 
06:05:12.830 --> 06:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
um but
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
I would imagine that if if they're
 
06:05:18.770 --> 06:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
putting a policy in place
 
06:05:20.990 --> 06:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
they should know already whether or not
 
06:05:23.930 --> 06:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
they have the authority to do so by what
 
06:05:26.868 --> 06:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
is direct they how they are directed in
 
06:05:30.530 --> 06:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
our state statutes and so
 
06:05:32.990 --> 06:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
um if they're putting a policy in place
 
06:05:33.000 --> 06:05:34.610 align:start position:0%
um if they're putting a policy in place
that

06:05:34.610 --> 06:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:05:38.030 --> 06:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
they have no authority to do then it
 
06:05:40.250 --> 06:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
would make sense to me that they should
 
06:05:44.448 --> 06:05:44.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:46.070 --> 06:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:05:47.330 --> 06:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
06:05:51.350 --> 06:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
just a clarification uh on line 15 of
 
06:05:54.770 --> 06:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
the bill it says during any public
 
06:05:56.570 --> 06:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
meeting held by a school board and an
 
06:05:59.390 --> 06:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
attendee May demand that goes on and
 
06:06:02.230 --> 06:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
talk about what they could ask for
 
06:06:05.330 --> 06:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
what is your definition of an attendee I
 
06:06:06.590 --> 06:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
mean if I'm
 
06:06:08.390 --> 06:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
right we've been conquered and I don't
 
06:06:10.190 --> 06:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
like what's going on in Rochester I go
 
06:06:11.930 --> 06:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
to the Rochester school board and I'm an
 
06:06:13.670 --> 06:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
attendee and I can ask the Rochester
 
06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
school board anything I want am I
 
06:06:20.570 --> 06:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:23.448 --> 06:06:23.458 align:start position:0%
I would imagine so
 
06:06:25.570 --> 06:06:25.580 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
06:06:28.910 --> 06:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
the reason why I put that in there is
 
06:06:31.430 --> 06:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
because we have had instances where
 
06:06:33.890 --> 06:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
people who live in the district
 
06:06:36.190 --> 06:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
who do not have children in the district
 
06:06:38.410 --> 06:06:38.420 align:start position:0%
are not allowed
 
06:06:42.410 --> 06:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
to uh post questions or participate we
 
06:06:44.570 --> 06:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
have seen instances of that
 
06:06:44.580 --> 06:06:45.948 align:start position:0%
have seen instances of that
and

06:06:45.948 --> 06:06:45.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:06:47.930 --> 06:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
um that's why I'm saying not necessarily
 
06:06:52.070 --> 06:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
a parent not necessarily uh
 
06:06:55.788 --> 06:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
you know someone who has a grant or a
 
06:06:55.798 --> 06:06:56.990 align:start position:0%
you know someone who has a grant or a
grandparent

06:06:56.990 --> 06:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
grandparent
 
06:06:59.270 --> 06:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
but someone who is attending the meeting
 
06:07:01.670 --> 06:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
who is a taxpayer
 
06:07:05.150 --> 06:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair uh I guess my
 
06:07:07.788 --> 06:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
specifically then my question goes to a
 
06:07:09.948 --> 06:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
resident are we talking about residents
 
06:07:12.410 --> 06:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
of whether they have children or they
 
06:07:14.448 --> 06:07:14.458 align:start position:0%
don't have children they're residents of
 
06:07:16.310 --> 06:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
that particular community
 
06:07:18.650 --> 06:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
but does this cover people coming from a
 
06:07:20.690 --> 06:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
community 60 miles away to ask questions
 
06:07:23.270 --> 06:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
about that school board policy where
 
06:07:25.070 --> 06:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
they have no connection
 
06:07:27.530 --> 06:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know why anybody from 60 miles
 
06:07:30.170 --> 06:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
away would go to a local school board
 
06:07:33.590 --> 06:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
meeting though but I I can appreciate
 
06:07:37.910 --> 06:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:39.650 --> 06:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair and thank
 
06:07:41.110 --> 06:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
you representative for being here today
 
06:07:43.610 --> 06:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
can you define sufficient what's
 
06:07:47.090 --> 06:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:49.730 --> 06:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
well you know in current statute it
 
06:07:52.670 --> 06:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
outlines 30 minutes
 
06:07:55.910 --> 06:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and I I would imagine that you know
 
06:07:58.670 --> 06:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
if you only had a few people one or two
 
06:08:01.310 --> 06:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
people who were uh
 
06:08:03.650 --> 06:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
it will encourage statute let me see
 
06:08:06.890 --> 06:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to say was that in current
 
06:08:06.900 --> 06:08:08.570 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to say was that in current
statute

06:08:08.570 --> 06:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:08:11.990 --> 06:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
it says the public comment period shall
 
06:08:14.868 --> 06:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
be for no less than 30 minutes well so
 
06:08:17.208 --> 06:08:17.218 align:start position:0%
if you only had maybe two people and it
 
06:08:18.948 --> 06:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
took you less than 30 minutes to answer
 
06:08:21.470 --> 06:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
those questions so are you going to sit
 
06:08:23.570 --> 06:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
there and wait till for 30 minutes goes
 
06:08:25.430 --> 06:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
by that's why I just sort of I didn't
 
06:08:27.470 --> 06:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
want to outline a specific time frame
 
06:08:29.990 --> 06:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
because I think you know there's common
 
06:08:32.690 --> 06:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
sense that enters in here too that you'd
 
06:08:34.368 --> 06:08:34.378 align:start position:0%
want to allow sufficient time for the
 
06:08:36.830 --> 06:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
number of people that are asking
 
06:08:36.840 --> 06:08:38.090 align:start position:0%
number of people that are asking
questions

06:08:38.090 --> 06:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:08:38.100 --> 06:08:40.090 align:start position:0%
questions
okay

06:08:40.090 --> 06:08:40.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:08:44.030 --> 06:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:08:45.530 --> 06:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
for answering my question and bringing
 
06:08:46.850 --> 06:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
this forward
 
06:08:48.288 --> 06:08:48.298 align:start position:0%
um this question might be better aimed
 
06:08:50.090 --> 06:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
at the school boards Association who I'm
 
06:08:52.730 --> 06:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
sure will testify but my question is do
 
06:08:54.650 --> 06:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
you know of any school boards that
 
06:08:57.048 --> 06:08:57.058 align:start position:0%
already have a practice in place that do
 
06:08:59.150 --> 06:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
designated time is that a majority of
 
06:09:00.770 --> 06:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
school boards maybe only a few that do
 
06:09:03.708 --> 06:09:03.718 align:start position:0%
that just a sense of that I don't know
 
06:09:05.868 --> 06:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
specifically but I know that there are
 
06:09:07.910 --> 06:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
school boards that do and school boards
 
06:09:10.128 --> 06:09:10.138 align:start position:0%
that don't okay thank you
 
06:09:12.890 --> 06:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
I I have a question for you
 
06:09:12.900 --> 06:09:13.730 align:start position:0%
I I have a question for you
um

06:09:13.730 --> 06:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:16.128 --> 06:09:16.138 align:start position:0%
on line 21
 
06:09:18.110 --> 06:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
if any public question remains
 
06:09:18.120 --> 06:09:19.970 align:start position:0%
if any public question remains
unanswered

06:09:19.970 --> 06:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
unanswered
 
06:09:21.770 --> 06:09:21.780 align:start position:0%
now we have a lot of issues going on
 
06:09:23.570 --> 06:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
which are labor issues which are
 
06:09:26.448 --> 06:09:26.458 align:start position:0%
confidential issues uh some funding
 
06:09:28.128 --> 06:09:28.138 align:start position:0%
issues we don't have any information
 
06:09:31.190 --> 06:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
relative to that question seeing that
 
06:09:33.948 --> 06:09:33.958 align:start position:0%
the budget hasn't been designed yet
 
06:09:36.708 --> 06:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
um so to me this wording is very very
 
06:09:36.718 --> 06:09:39.410 align:start position:0%
um so to me this wording is very very
ambiguous

06:09:39.410 --> 06:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
ambiguous
 
06:09:41.448 --> 06:09:41.458 align:start position:0%
how would you fix this
 
06:09:44.990 --> 06:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay well you know an answer is an
 
06:09:47.570 --> 06:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
answer is an answer and I mean you can
 
06:09:49.788 --> 06:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
say uh we don't have that information
 
06:09:52.310 --> 06:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
right now but we can get that to you
 
06:09:54.530 --> 06:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
when it is available
 
06:09:58.548 --> 06:09:58.558 align:start position:0%
um that's an answer we can they can but
 
06:10:00.830 --> 06:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
but we have seen instances in school
 
06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
board meetings where the there is no
 
06:10:06.110 --> 06:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
answer they don't even give an answer
 
06:10:10.010 --> 06:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
they summarily ignore what the question
 
06:10:13.490 --> 06:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
is then and that's not right either I
 
06:10:16.250 --> 06:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
think that as public officials uh people
 
06:10:18.128 --> 06:10:18.138 align:start position:0%
should be
 
06:10:20.930 --> 06:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
responsible to giving
 
06:10:23.570 --> 06:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
an answer to a question from a parent or
 
06:10:26.650 --> 06:10:26.660 align:start position:0%
taxpayer person in the district
 
06:10:29.628 --> 06:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
regarding whatever the question has to
 
06:10:29.638 --> 06:10:30.770 align:start position:0%
regarding whatever the question has to
do

06:10:30.770 --> 06:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:10:35.208 --> 06:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
um so say you know you you say it's a
 
06:10:37.788 --> 06:10:37.798 align:start position:0%
labor issue well I'm sorry that that's
 
06:10:39.288 --> 06:10:39.298 align:start position:0%
confidential we can't give that
 
06:10:42.010 --> 06:10:42.020 align:start position:0%
information out to you in the public
 
06:10:46.610 --> 06:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
or you can give you can give an answer
 
06:10:46.620 --> 06:10:49.090 align:start position:0%
or you can give you can give an answer
that

06:10:49.090 --> 06:10:49.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:10:51.830 --> 06:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
explains why you can't give a specific
 
06:10:51.840 --> 06:10:53.030 align:start position:0%
explains why you can't give a specific
answer

06:10:53.030 --> 06:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
answer
 
06:10:55.730 --> 06:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's
 
06:10:58.610 --> 06:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
you know that's what I'm saying here
 
06:11:00.350 --> 06:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions yes
 
06:11:00.360 --> 06:11:01.788 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions yes
representative

06:11:01.788 --> 06:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:11:03.530 --> 06:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Chevrolet good afternoon
 
06:11:05.208 --> 06:11:05.218 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for uh taking
 
06:11:07.190 --> 06:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
this question and waiting around till
 
06:11:08.628 --> 06:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon
 
06:11:10.070 --> 06:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple first off do you
 
06:11:12.770 --> 06:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
think there's a responsibility of of uh
 
06:11:14.150 --> 06:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
people who are participating in school
 
06:11:15.830 --> 06:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
board in public to be respectful to the
 
06:11:18.610 --> 06:11:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:22.850 --> 06:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
absolutely I mean people both both sides
 
06:11:24.530 --> 06:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
must be respectful to each other that's
 
06:11:26.930 --> 06:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
how we have good meetings Okay into my
 
06:11:26.940 --> 06:11:28.510 align:start position:0%
how we have good meetings Okay into my
fall

06:11:28.510 --> 06:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
fall
 
06:11:31.548 --> 06:11:31.558 align:start position:0%
I was following I'd highlighted uh line
 
06:11:33.830 --> 06:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
21 has had representative Vlad I mean
 
06:11:36.048 --> 06:11:36.058 align:start position:0%
honest to me but I was thinking about in
 
06:11:38.448 --> 06:11:38.458 align:start position:0%
my particular school districts we have
 
06:11:41.690 --> 06:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
an ongoing uh dialogue about the closing
 
06:11:43.548 --> 06:11:43.558 align:start position:0%
or not clothing of elementary school as
 
06:11:45.470 --> 06:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
many schools out with recline enrollment
 
06:11:48.410 --> 06:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh and there's no way that that the if
 
06:11:50.090 --> 06:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
you asked me the school board member or
 
06:11:51.410 --> 06:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
if you ask the superintendent to ask
 
06:11:53.030 --> 06:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
anyone if they can be able to answer
 
06:11:55.670 --> 06:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
that within that I'm eating because
 
06:11:57.650 --> 06:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
they're still talking about it and they
 
06:11:58.910 --> 06:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
will never be able to give you an answer
 
06:12:01.128 --> 06:12:01.138 align:start position:0%
within five business days because there
 
06:12:03.048 --> 06:12:03.058 align:start position:0%
isn't an answer yet but you're saying
 
06:12:04.850 --> 06:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
there there remains an answer that
 
06:12:06.350 --> 06:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for maintaining an
 
06:12:07.788 --> 06:12:07.798 align:start position:0%
answer that's what it says you're
 
06:12:09.288 --> 06:12:09.298 align:start position:0%
responsible for obtaining an answer
 
06:12:11.510 --> 06:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
responding within five days that is a
 
06:12:13.548 --> 06:12:13.558 align:start position:0%
topic that's that they can't
 
06:12:15.350 --> 06:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what would happen in
 
06:12:17.090 --> 06:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
that case well the response would be we
 
06:12:18.770 --> 06:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
don't have that information right now
 
06:12:20.868 --> 06:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
but when we get that information we can
 
06:12:22.490 --> 06:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
supply that to you
 
06:12:26.208 --> 06:12:26.218 align:start position:0%
so that no answer is the answer then
 
06:12:28.548 --> 06:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the information to
 
06:12:32.270 --> 06:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
supply then you can demon you can say we
 
06:12:34.250 --> 06:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
we don't have that information right now
 
06:12:36.288 --> 06:12:36.298 align:start position:0%
but we can give that to you okay that's
 
06:12:39.110 --> 06:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
an answer okay and one more if I may yes
 
06:12:41.810 --> 06:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh last one was three
 
06:12:43.128 --> 06:12:43.138 align:start position:0%
times during your presentation you
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
talked about that the school board local
 
06:12:46.310 --> 06:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
school board should be held accountable
 
06:12:49.548 --> 06:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
which I agree but it seems to me that
 
06:12:51.350 --> 06:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
the local election for school board the
 
06:12:53.270 --> 06:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
way they hold people accountable if you
 
06:12:54.530 --> 06:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
don't agree or the person hasn't
 
06:12:56.208 --> 06:12:56.218 align:start position:0%
responded to you the next Global
 
06:12:58.330 --> 06:12:58.340 align:start position:0%
election you don't elect them
 
06:13:01.310 --> 06:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
so are you then is that a way to hold
 
06:13:03.110 --> 06:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
them accountable just not re-elect them
 
06:13:07.070 --> 06:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's one way but um
 
06:13:09.350 --> 06:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
I think you know you have to would you
 
06:13:11.570 --> 06:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
have to wait then two years for
 
06:13:14.330 --> 06:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh for for them to be accountable to
 
06:13:17.208 --> 06:13:17.218 align:start position:0%
what they're doing no no okay I think
 
06:13:19.070 --> 06:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
that you know once you you're elected
 
06:13:21.470 --> 06:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
you're accountable during the time that
 
06:13:23.690 --> 06:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
you're in office aren't you
 
06:13:26.690 --> 06:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
sometimes I guess thank you for the
 
06:13:28.490 --> 06:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
questions representative Cornell
 
06:13:30.288 --> 06:13:30.298 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
06:13:32.628 --> 06:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
question line 25 says members of the
 
06:13:34.190 --> 06:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
public May file a complaint to the
 
06:13:35.628 --> 06:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
06:13:38.570 --> 06:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
Education I I is it true that school
 
06:13:41.090 --> 06:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
locally elected school board members are
 
06:13:42.590 --> 06:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
answerable to the commissioner of
 
06:13:42.600 --> 06:13:44.890 align:start position:0%
answerable to the commissioner of
Education

06:13:44.890 --> 06:13:44.900 align:start position:0%
Education
 
06:13:48.470 --> 06:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
to some to some extent they are
 
06:13:48.480 --> 06:13:49.548 align:start position:0%
to some to some extent they are
oh

06:13:49.548 --> 06:13:49.558 align:start position:0%
oh
 
06:13:51.948 --> 06:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
06:13:54.770 --> 06:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
I I'm assuming attorney Fenton is going
 
06:13:56.208 --> 06:13:56.218 align:start position:0%
to testify or the School Board
 
06:13:58.730 --> 06:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
Association to answer that
 
06:14:03.670 --> 06:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:06.650 --> 06:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative Balboni
 
06:14:08.510 --> 06:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:14:12.048 --> 06:14:12.058 align:start position:0%
my question on line 14 it says that uh
 
06:14:14.030 --> 06:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
complaints shall not be limited to what
 
06:14:15.770 --> 06:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
is on the school board agenda for the
 
06:14:18.410 --> 06:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
meeting I think that school board
 
06:14:20.270 --> 06:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
agendas tend to be pretty tight there's
 
06:14:22.070 --> 06:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of business that needs to be done
 
06:14:24.170 --> 06:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
during the meeting as well as having the
 
06:14:26.510 --> 06:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
public comment and down further you say
 
06:14:28.070 --> 06:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
that the board members should be
 
06:14:31.970 --> 06:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
prepared to give the answer plus the RSA
 
06:14:34.730 --> 06:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
and the policies if we don't know or if
 
06:14:37.490 --> 06:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
a board member doesn't know what topics
 
06:14:39.350 --> 06:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
are going to be asked don't you think
 
06:14:41.448 --> 06:14:41.458 align:start position:0%
it's a little difficult for them to be
 
06:14:43.850 --> 06:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
able to then also give them the policy
 
06:14:45.590 --> 06:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
and the RSA
 
06:14:48.470 --> 06:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
no because if you're a member of the
 
06:14:49.910 --> 06:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
school board and you're making policies
 
06:14:52.128 --> 06:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
you should know
 
06:14:55.970 --> 06:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
what you're where you have uh authority
 
06:14:59.448 --> 06:14:59.458 align:start position:0%
to make those policies from and
 
06:15:02.030 --> 06:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
um whether something is on the agenda or
 
06:15:04.190 --> 06:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
not I think it should be open to
 
06:15:07.070 --> 06:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
discussion or at least question from the
 
06:15:10.430 --> 06:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:12.650 --> 06:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
06:15:14.330 --> 06:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
um a lot of school boards have a special
 
06:15:16.730 --> 06:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
meeting suggests to special topics with
 
06:15:21.048 --> 06:15:21.058 align:start position:0%
that uh alleviate the need to have an
 
06:15:23.208 --> 06:15:23.218 align:start position:0%
open session for all topics at every
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%

literally attended I would have to say
 
06:16:16.020 --> 06:16:17.208 align:start position:0%
literally attended I would have to say
probably

06:16:17.208 --> 06:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
probably
 
06:16:18.890 --> 06:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
um more than a dozen school board
 
06:16:21.590 --> 06:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
meetings over the last two years
 
06:16:24.490 --> 06:16:24.500 align:start position:0%
throughout the state Derry Londonderry
 
06:16:28.548 --> 06:16:28.558 align:start position:0%
Bedford Loudon Rochester
 
06:16:33.410 --> 06:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
SAU 16 multiple Portsmouth New Market
 
06:16:36.288 --> 06:16:36.298 align:start position:0%
this is so important and maybe there
 
06:16:38.330 --> 06:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
needs to be a little cleaning up on the
 
06:16:40.490 --> 06:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
language from some of the questions I I
 
06:16:42.708 --> 06:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
can um an amendment put in I can
 
06:16:44.628 --> 06:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
understand that but I'm just going to
 
06:16:46.788 --> 06:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
give you an example of being there to
 
06:16:49.610 --> 06:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
support friends of mine at a new market
 
06:16:52.430 --> 06:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
school board meeting where they lock the
 
06:16:56.448 --> 06:16:56.458 align:start position:0%
doors and let us sit outside and we had
 
06:16:59.150 --> 06:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
to listen to the school board meeting on
 
06:17:02.030 --> 06:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
zoom on the phone you couldn't hear
 
06:17:04.548 --> 06:17:04.558 align:start position:0%
anything try people trying to give
 
06:17:04.558 --> 06:17:05.930 align:start position:0%
anything try people trying to give
testimony

06:17:05.930 --> 06:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:17:08.990 --> 06:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
so those four families have now pulled
 
06:17:11.708 --> 06:17:11.718 align:start position:0%
their children out of that school
 
06:17:13.850 --> 06:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
I can give
 
06:17:16.670 --> 06:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
so many other examples uh Londonderry
 
06:17:18.048 --> 06:17:18.058 align:start position:0%
school board meeting
 
06:17:21.410 --> 06:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
which was they literally did they don't
 
06:17:25.010 --> 06:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
answer questions there is no open Forum
 
06:17:29.750 --> 06:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's a one-way operation usually and
 
06:17:32.030 --> 06:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's hard to
 
06:17:34.128 --> 06:17:34.138 align:start position:0%
you don't want to legislate anything but
 
06:17:36.770 --> 06:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
we're at that point and
 
06:17:38.990 --> 06:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
um people should be respectful at
 
06:17:41.090 --> 06:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
meetings definitely
 
06:17:43.430 --> 06:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
um but but it definitely goes both ways
 
06:17:45.948 --> 06:17:45.958 align:start position:0%
as well and I think just in regards with
 
06:17:49.368 --> 06:17:49.378 align:start position:0%
what's happened during the pandemic
 
06:17:49.378 --> 06:17:50.750 align:start position:0%
what's happened during the pandemic
sorry

06:17:50.750 --> 06:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:17:50.760 --> 06:17:53.810 align:start position:0%
sorry
um pandemic

06:17:53.810 --> 06:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:53.820 --> 06:17:54.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:17:54.650 --> 06:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:54.660 --> 06:17:56.868 align:start position:0%
um
sorry

06:17:56.868 --> 06:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
06:18:00.350 --> 06:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
um we've had experienced a lot of
 
06:18:02.330 --> 06:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
um this necessity to have a bill like
 
06:18:05.208 --> 06:18:05.218 align:start position:0%
this so I appreciate uh representative
 
06:18:07.730 --> 06:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
for putting this forward I'd be happy to
 
06:18:09.350 --> 06:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
06:18:12.650 --> 06:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
and most of these things are all covered
 
06:18:14.990 --> 06:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
um you know in regards with rules and
 
06:18:16.788 --> 06:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
all those different types of things in
 
06:18:20.270 --> 06:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
in a in an RSA under education or
 
06:18:22.670 --> 06:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
chapter 197 so
 
06:18:24.470 --> 06:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
um that's it
 
06:18:26.990 --> 06:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions from
 
06:18:28.548 --> 06:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
06:18:31.250 --> 06:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative miler thank you Mr
 
06:18:34.010 --> 06:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here just
 
06:18:36.770 --> 06:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
one question in those communities that
 
06:18:40.128 --> 06:18:40.138 align:start position:0%
that were abusive that's my term not
 
06:18:42.830 --> 06:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
your term to parents or to Citizens
 
06:18:44.990 --> 06:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
where those school board members then
 
06:18:48.110 --> 06:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
not elected again in the next election
 
06:18:51.288 --> 06:18:51.298 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know actually
 
06:18:53.930 --> 06:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
so if we just look at New Market
 
06:18:56.390 --> 06:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
um and Londonderry no they're all
 
06:18:58.910 --> 06:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
they're all back in thank you
 
06:19:01.788 --> 06:19:01.798 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:19:04.730 --> 06:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay
 
06:19:15.190 --> 06:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:18.650 --> 06:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman committee members uh Aubry
 
06:19:21.288 --> 06:19:21.298 align:start position:0%
Friedman Bridgewater private citizen I
 
06:19:23.810 --> 06:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
am super in support of this bill and
 
06:19:25.430 --> 06:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
I've been waiting for a bill like this
 
06:19:27.650 --> 06:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
for a while I'd go to almost every
 
06:19:30.350 --> 06:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
school board meeting and I always speak
 
06:19:30.360 --> 06:19:32.390 align:start position:0%
school board meeting and I always speak
and

06:19:32.390 --> 06:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:19:36.110 --> 06:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
they sit there with stone faces I mean
 
06:19:37.490 --> 06:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes you just make comments so if
 
06:19:40.548 --> 06:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
you make a comment uh then you don't
 
06:19:42.410 --> 06:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
really expect an answer but I do ask
 
06:19:44.150 --> 06:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
questions I will have to say for our
 
06:19:48.350 --> 06:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
school board uh they will if it's an
 
06:19:51.110 --> 06:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
easy question they will off either the
 
06:19:53.868 --> 06:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
superintendent or the chair will just
 
06:19:55.788 --> 06:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
answer right on the spot which is good
 
06:19:55.798 --> 06:19:57.590 align:start position:0%
answer right on the spot which is good
however

06:19:57.590 --> 06:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:20:01.070 --> 06:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
there are difficult questions and uh
 
06:20:04.510 --> 06:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
they're stone-faced and that is totally
 
06:20:07.970 --> 06:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
rude I mean if you ask me a question and
 
06:20:10.610 --> 06:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
I just sat there with a stone face I
 
06:20:13.510 --> 06:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
mean that is plain rude if nothing else
 
06:20:17.150 --> 06:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
let alone not being accountable so I
 
06:20:20.510 --> 06:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
think this bill is reasonable as you
 
06:20:22.910 --> 06:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
know you don't have the answer you do
 
06:20:25.368 --> 06:20:25.378 align:start position:0%
need to respond and we'll get back to
 
06:20:27.830 --> 06:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
you or something like that or you know
 
06:20:30.048 --> 06:20:30.058 align:start position:0%
if you don't have it in five days sorry
 
06:20:32.270 --> 06:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
I tried but uh we just couldn't get that
 
06:20:34.310 --> 06:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
information that's reasonable that's an
 
06:20:36.470 --> 06:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
answer but to just sit there with a
 
06:20:38.868 --> 06:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
stone phase and I know why they do it is
 
06:20:40.670 --> 06:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
because the New Hampshire School Board
 
06:20:44.030 --> 06:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
Association specifically advises school
 
06:20:46.670 --> 06:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
board members to not say anything and
 
06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
believe me I railed against that
 
06:20:51.048 --> 06:20:51.058 align:start position:0%
organization so they just don't say
 
06:20:51.058 --> 06:20:52.430 align:start position:0%
organization so they just don't say
anything

06:20:52.430 --> 06:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
anything
 
06:20:55.610 --> 06:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
um also this business about citing the
 
06:20:59.750 --> 06:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
RSA or the uh rule that I think that's
 
06:21:02.208 --> 06:21:02.218 align:start position:0%
reasonable if you're taking an action
 
06:21:04.490 --> 06:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
that affects the public and public
 
06:21:07.190 --> 06:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
dollars you should know what your
 
06:21:09.350 --> 06:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
Authority is I think this will actually
 
06:21:11.330 --> 06:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
Force they should know the rules if they
 
06:21:13.190 --> 06:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
don't it could be a little burden on
 
06:21:15.410 --> 06:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
them to make sure they know it but I
 
06:21:17.570 --> 06:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
don't think that's unreasonable to know
 
06:21:20.090 --> 06:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
what your Authority is and my only
 
06:21:22.548 --> 06:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill is actually I
 
06:21:24.288 --> 06:21:24.298 align:start position:0%
think it doesn't go far enough there
 
06:21:26.510 --> 06:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
should be an actual penalty because it
 
06:21:30.230 --> 06:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
says members of the public May file a
 
06:21:33.170 --> 06:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
complaint well that's very nice to file
 
06:21:35.810 --> 06:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
a complaint but honestly a bill without
 
06:21:39.410 --> 06:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
teeth is is only a suggestion and they
 
06:21:41.810 --> 06:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
can just ignore it I say give them a
 
06:21:44.810 --> 06:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
fine it was a 50 bucks 100 bucks if
 
06:21:47.030 --> 06:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to break the law we as
 
06:21:50.030 --> 06:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
members of the public we have to follow
 
06:21:52.788 --> 06:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
the law and we have consequences if we
 
06:21:55.368 --> 06:21:55.378 align:start position:0%
don't uh do what we're supposed to so I
 
06:21:59.030 --> 06:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
say put a penalty in it a fine and let
 
06:22:01.010 --> 06:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
them answer for it
 
06:22:01.020 --> 06:22:01.850 align:start position:0%
them answer for it
um

06:22:01.850 --> 06:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:04.250 --> 06:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
and that's it uh thank you thank you any
 
06:22:06.250 --> 06:22:06.260 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
06:22:08.810 --> 06:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
06:22:08.820 --> 06:22:10.430 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
presentation

06:22:10.430 --> 06:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
06:22:11.570 --> 06:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
um I've worked for three different
 
06:22:14.030 --> 06:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
school districts so I I'm not really
 
06:22:16.070 --> 06:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
clear and understanding
 
06:22:18.530 --> 06:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
what your experience can you give us an
 
06:22:22.070 --> 06:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
example where someone
 
06:22:25.190 --> 06:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
kind of was rude no they're out of
 
06:22:27.470 --> 06:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
curiosity or do you know any specifics
 
06:22:32.330 --> 06:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
they're not rude we in our SAU 4 like
 
06:22:34.128 --> 06:22:34.138 align:start position:0%
was described earlier we're pretty good
 
06:22:36.470 --> 06:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
now when they had the mask and all that
 
06:22:39.110 --> 06:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
kind of commotion uh they did get the
 
06:22:41.030 --> 06:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
police officers just in case but we
 
06:22:43.670 --> 06:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
never had any trouble uh we are all
 
06:22:46.730 --> 06:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
civil and I've and and so there we don't
 
06:22:48.288 --> 06:22:48.298 align:start position:0%
have any of that problem it's just
 
06:22:51.610 --> 06:22:51.620 align:start position:0%
sitting there stone-faced is
 
06:22:55.670 --> 06:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
unacceptable it's it's plain rude so um
 
06:22:57.830 --> 06:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
and I think this is that's why this bill
 
06:22:59.690 --> 06:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
is necessary but we don't have any
 
06:23:02.628 --> 06:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
trouble like that okay follow up just
 
06:23:05.628 --> 06:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
for clarity so if a school board sits
 
06:23:08.090 --> 06:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
like I'm I'm like am I sitting
 
06:23:10.190 --> 06:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
stone-faced I mean I'm interested in
 
06:23:11.948 --> 06:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
what you're saying but well is it
 
06:23:15.288 --> 06:23:15.298 align:start position:0%
precipitated on just the way they're
 
06:23:18.288 --> 06:23:18.298 align:start position:0%
presented no no sir well if you but
 
06:23:20.090 --> 06:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
you've made a comment okay a comment you
 
06:23:21.770 --> 06:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
don't need to say anything but if you've
 
06:23:23.570 --> 06:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
asked a question you've raised your
 
06:23:25.930 --> 06:23:25.940 align:start position:0%
voice at the end it was a question mark
 
06:23:29.570 --> 06:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh somebody should answer it I don't see
 
06:23:30.590 --> 06:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
why not
 
06:23:30.600 --> 06:23:32.830 align:start position:0%
why not
uh

06:23:32.830 --> 06:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:23:35.650 --> 06:23:35.660 align:start position:0%
you know somebody
 
06:23:38.990 --> 06:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's outrageous to ask
 
06:23:41.090 --> 06:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
somebody and even if you say well we
 
06:23:43.250 --> 06:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
don't know right now I don't know but we
 
06:23:45.350 --> 06:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
will get back to you that would be
 
06:23:47.030 --> 06:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable and then they have to follow
 
06:23:50.270 --> 06:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
up so it's not the way they look it's
 
06:23:53.448 --> 06:23:53.458 align:start position:0%
just you ask the question
 
06:23:56.270 --> 06:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
somebody please answer and I do ask hard
 
06:23:59.270 --> 06:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
questions so I think an answer we will
 
06:24:01.128 --> 06:24:01.138 align:start position:0%
get back to you we've got to research it
 
06:24:04.490 --> 06:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
hard questions are asked and and I do
 
06:24:07.128 --> 06:24:07.138 align:start position:0%
ask them but they're not unreasonable so
 
06:24:09.708 --> 06:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
I just think it's common courtesy of
 
06:24:11.868 --> 06:24:11.878 align:start position:0%
nothing else
 
06:24:13.610 --> 06:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
06:24:14.990 --> 06:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you
 
06:24:17.090 --> 06:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
06:24:19.250 --> 06:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
as someone you being as someone who
 
06:24:20.570 --> 06:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
attend school with me is regularly I
 
06:24:22.070 --> 06:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
take from your from your dialogue which
 
06:24:23.510 --> 06:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
is terrific it's good to have people
 
06:24:24.948 --> 06:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
like you there
 
06:24:26.810 --> 06:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned thinking about the
 
06:24:28.788 --> 06:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
other side of the table do you see that
 
06:24:30.830 --> 06:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
any problem with that someone can just
 
06:24:33.230 --> 06:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
come in and ask questions and have
 
06:24:35.270 --> 06:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
comments of about issues that aren't
 
06:24:37.310 --> 06:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
even on the school board agenda that
 
06:24:38.690 --> 06:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
night or do you think that's going to
 
06:24:40.868 --> 06:24:40.878 align:start position:0%
really be a problem
 
06:24:43.490 --> 06:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
comments or not if it's a comment it's a
 
06:24:45.770 --> 06:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
comment if you ask
 
06:24:45.780 --> 06:24:46.730 align:start position:0%
comment if you ask
um

06:24:46.730 --> 06:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:50.090 --> 06:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
you know like in ours we have the
 
06:24:51.770 --> 06:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
30-minute thing and they announce it
 
06:24:53.690 --> 06:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
right at the beginning it's a little
 
06:24:55.548 --> 06:24:55.558 align:start position:0%
awkward what the 30 minutes thing to be
 
06:24:57.350 --> 06:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
honest because something might come up
 
06:25:00.350 --> 06:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
while they start maybe 15. okay I didn't
 
06:25:01.730 --> 06:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
mean some of this on the agenda to talk
 
06:25:03.410 --> 06:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
about that that's just any yours they
 
06:25:05.270 --> 06:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
might bring up any old thing don't have
 
06:25:07.010 --> 06:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
to be on the agenda so you can just come
 
06:25:08.150 --> 06:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
in and start asking questions about
 
06:25:09.830 --> 06:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
anything I think that's going to make
 
06:25:11.270 --> 06:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
for an orderly meeting
 
06:25:13.250 --> 06:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
I don't see why not
 
06:25:14.510 --> 06:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
um I mean they're going to ask crazy
 
06:25:17.270 --> 06:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions uh no I say I don't know or
 
06:25:20.030 --> 06:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you chair you're
 
06:25:21.708 --> 06:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
welcome further questions from the
 
06:25:21.718 --> 06:25:22.970 align:start position:0%
welcome further questions from the
committee

06:25:22.970 --> 06:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:25:26.390 --> 06:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:34.070 --> 06:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:35.628 --> 06:25:35.638 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
06:25:37.490 --> 06:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
committee man
 
06:25:40.310 --> 06:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
um I am not going to bore you with my
 
06:25:42.650 --> 06:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
story but again
 
06:25:44.270 --> 06:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
um but I will tell you that I tried to
 
06:25:46.670 --> 06:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
address it with the school board
 
06:25:48.830 --> 06:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
um this was a long time ago
 
06:25:51.708 --> 06:25:51.718 align:start position:0%
but um it did not it did not end well
 
06:25:54.230 --> 06:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
for me the bottom line is is because of
 
06:25:56.990 --> 06:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
my experience I've become a child parent
 
06:25:59.930 --> 06:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
and in some instances even a teacher or
 
06:26:03.170 --> 06:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
a parent's support so it is very
 
06:26:05.868 --> 06:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
important that anyone should be able to
 
06:26:08.270 --> 06:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
raise the question because there is a
 
06:26:11.030 --> 06:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
chilling going on between parents and
 
06:26:13.310 --> 06:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
our school board between teachers and
 
06:26:17.208 --> 06:26:17.218 align:start position:0%
our school board it's it exists now if
 
06:26:18.948 --> 06:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
you don't want to believe it
 
06:26:22.190 --> 06:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
go to go to some school board meetings
 
06:26:25.310 --> 06:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
and you'll feel it ask parents ask
 
06:26:27.410 --> 06:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
children ask teachers and you'll feel it
 
06:26:30.170 --> 06:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
in my town most of our school board
 
06:26:34.670 --> 06:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
members are also on the Nea
 
06:26:37.610 --> 06:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
they're members of the Nea for me that's
 
06:26:41.208 --> 06:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
a pro National Education Association
 
06:26:43.150 --> 06:26:43.160 align:start position:0%
I believe that's a conflict of interest
 
06:26:48.650 --> 06:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
my school my school manager is not even
 
06:26:51.650 --> 06:26:51.660 align:start position:0%
a member of my town
 
06:26:55.548 --> 06:26:55.558 align:start position:0%
so as as a concerned citizen the only
 
06:26:58.910 --> 06:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
Avenue I have a lot of times is through
 
06:27:01.250 --> 06:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
this process
 
06:27:03.170 --> 06:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
um our school
 
06:27:05.090 --> 06:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
our our
 
06:27:07.548 --> 06:27:07.558 align:start position:0%
School Board
 
06:27:09.410 --> 06:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
I have been told
 
06:27:12.948 --> 06:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
is run by a bully
 
06:27:16.430 --> 06:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
our school board I have been told is
 
06:27:18.770 --> 06:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
full of bullies
 
06:27:23.150 --> 06:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
and that is why the few non-bullies that
 
06:27:25.788 --> 06:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
they us they have identified themselves
 
06:27:28.010 --> 06:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
as non-bullies and I don't know if
 
06:27:31.070 --> 06:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
they're even still on the board but they
 
06:27:33.490 --> 06:27:33.500 align:start position:0%
say that they go along to get along
 
06:27:37.070 --> 06:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
because it's better than being bullied
 
06:27:40.548 --> 06:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
so if we have school boards that even
 
06:27:44.090 --> 06:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
the members are being chilled
 
06:27:46.850 --> 06:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
it's a responsibility I am all for
 
06:27:49.368 --> 06:27:49.378 align:start position:0%
smaller government but we have gotten to
 
06:27:52.368 --> 06:27:52.378 align:start position:0%
the point that we have trusted in our
 
06:27:54.650 --> 06:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
elected officials for so long
 
06:27:57.350 --> 06:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
that it's time to start standing up it's
 
06:27:59.570 --> 06:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
time to start being vocal
 
06:28:01.010 --> 06:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to make a couple of
 
06:28:03.770 --> 06:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
comments with regards to the questions
 
06:28:07.010 --> 06:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
that you folks said sufficient time you
 
06:28:09.288 --> 06:28:09.298 align:start position:0%
folks here at the State House do a great
 
06:28:12.288 --> 06:28:12.298 align:start position:0%
job in allowing people to be heard
 
06:28:14.208 --> 06:28:14.218 align:start position:0%
even people that are very very
 
06:28:18.590 --> 06:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
impassioned very uh upset you do a great
 
06:28:22.430 --> 06:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
job you give them adequate time if if it
 
06:28:24.650 --> 06:28:24.660 align:start position:0%
can't happen in that time frame you make
 
06:28:26.510 --> 06:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
arrangements so it'll happen in the
 
06:28:26.520 --> 06:28:27.830 align:start position:0%
arrangements so it'll happen in the
future

06:28:27.830 --> 06:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
future
 
06:28:30.770 --> 06:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
why can't the school boards do that
 
06:28:32.810 --> 06:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
aren't they elected too
 
06:28:34.670 --> 06:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
aren't they held supposed to be held
 
06:28:36.048 --> 06:28:36.058 align:start position:0%
accountable and responsible to the
 
06:28:38.750 --> 06:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
people that elected them as far as a
 
06:28:40.310 --> 06:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
defined attendee I think I've already
 
06:28:42.530 --> 06:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
spoken to that is there are some
 
06:28:45.730 --> 06:28:45.740 align:start position:0%
instances that the parents are so afraid
 
06:28:49.070 --> 06:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
that their children may be singled out
 
06:28:53.208 --> 06:28:53.218 align:start position:0%
and bullied and sent to certain
 
06:28:56.208 --> 06:28:56.218 align:start position:0%
places during the school day because now
 
06:28:57.948 --> 06:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
we can't find out where they are during
 
06:29:00.530 --> 06:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
the school day that they don't want to
 
06:29:01.610 --> 06:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
speak up
 
06:29:03.170 --> 06:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
so sometimes they'll reach out to
 
06:29:04.610 --> 06:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
someone who is not part of that
 
06:29:07.490 --> 06:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
Community to speak on their behalf and
 
06:29:11.150 --> 06:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:11.160 --> 06:29:12.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:29:12.110 --> 06:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:15.110 --> 06:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's uh the address the issue they come
 
06:29:18.410 --> 06:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
up with regards to uh remains unanswered
 
06:29:20.690 --> 06:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
by the end of the public meeting
 
06:29:23.090 --> 06:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
easy solution say I don't know but I'll
 
06:29:25.070 --> 06:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
get back to you that's that shows
 
06:29:27.708 --> 06:29:27.718 align:start position:0%
respect that shows accountability and
 
06:29:27.718 --> 06:29:29.170 align:start position:0%
respect that shows accountability and
responsibility

06:29:29.170 --> 06:29:29.180 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
06:29:32.270 --> 06:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
and if it's not if it's an item you know
 
06:29:33.948 --> 06:29:33.958 align:start position:0%
how they always have the agendas and
 
06:29:36.170 --> 06:29:36.180 align:start position:0%
then they have new business if it's an
 
06:29:38.868 --> 06:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
item of new business then new business
 
06:29:41.948 --> 06:29:41.958 align:start position:0%
should be very limited in its comments
 
06:29:46.250 --> 06:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
and new business may have to go on to a
 
06:29:48.410 --> 06:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
forward agenda that is one way to keep
 
06:29:52.330 --> 06:29:52.340 align:start position:0%
the uh meetings orderly
 
06:29:56.930 --> 06:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
needs teeth with a fine I don't disagree
 
06:29:59.510 --> 06:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
um at all I don't know if needs teeth
 
06:30:01.310 --> 06:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
with a fine needs to be done at this
 
06:30:04.548 --> 06:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
level or at the at the local level but I
 
06:30:06.288 --> 06:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
do understand what's the point of having
 
06:30:09.590 --> 06:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
rules if you don't have to follow them
 
06:30:11.570 --> 06:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
um and voting people in and out of
 
06:30:14.990 --> 06:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
office unfortunately at a local level at
 
06:30:17.150 --> 06:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
a local level when we are voting for
 
06:30:17.160 --> 06:30:18.730 align:start position:0%
a local level when we are voting for
people

06:30:18.730 --> 06:30:18.740 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:30:21.230 --> 06:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately most people vote for
 
06:30:22.910 --> 06:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
people they know
 
06:30:24.890 --> 06:30:24.900 align:start position:0%
they're they oh he goes to the men's
 
06:30:27.110 --> 06:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
club he's good oh she's part of the
 
06:30:29.330 --> 06:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
Bedford Women's Club she's great
 
06:30:31.610 --> 06:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
but they don't know their politics they
 
06:30:35.330 --> 06:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
don't know how how they're going to
 
06:30:39.288 --> 06:30:39.298 align:start position:0%
enact restrictions or limitations on
 
06:30:41.030 --> 06:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
their on their
 
06:30:41.040 --> 06:30:42.368 align:start position:0%
their on their
family

06:30:42.368 --> 06:30:42.378 align:start position:0%
family
 
06:30:46.070 --> 06:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm not opposed to the fine
 
06:30:48.350 --> 06:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
um but and I do understand that it needs
 
06:30:51.470 --> 06:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
teeth but a bill like this needs to be
 
06:30:53.448 --> 06:30:53.458 align:start position:0%
done at the state level and then maybe
 
06:30:55.970 --> 06:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
the fine we can work try and work out
 
06:30:58.490 --> 06:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
individually at the local level
 
06:30:59.868 --> 06:30:59.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
06:31:02.628 --> 06:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
questions represent Allison uh thank you
 
06:31:05.208 --> 06:31:05.218 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just a clarify clarifying
 
06:31:08.030 --> 06:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
question uh you made a comment about Nea
 
06:31:10.310 --> 06:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
members are you in a position to decide
 
06:31:12.890 --> 06:31:12.900 align:start position:0%
which labor organization Educators join
 
06:31:14.208 --> 06:31:14.218 align:start position:0%
or don't join
 
06:31:17.810 --> 06:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
absolutely not but my problem is is that
 
06:31:19.610 --> 06:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
when you're a school member when you're
 
06:31:22.670 --> 06:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
when you're a member of an association
 
06:31:27.350 --> 06:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay unfortunately too many people re
 
06:31:30.590 --> 06:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
too many people are beholden to that
 
06:31:32.628 --> 06:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
organization now they sh if they're if
 
06:31:34.250 --> 06:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
they're a school board member they
 
06:31:36.048 --> 06:31:36.058 align:start position:0%
should be beholden to the constituents
 
06:31:39.530 --> 06:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
first and that organization second what
 
06:31:41.690 --> 06:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
I have seen in my town that is not the
 
06:31:41.700 --> 06:31:42.530 align:start position:0%
I have seen in my town that is not the
case

06:31:42.530 --> 06:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
case
 
06:31:44.810 --> 06:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
and that is my issue
 
06:31:47.510 --> 06:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
06:31:48.890 --> 06:31:48.900 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you for being here
 
06:31:48.900 --> 06:31:50.090 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you for being here
again

06:31:50.090 --> 06:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:31:52.610 --> 06:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering um we have to file
 
06:31:56.150 --> 06:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
campaign disclosure forms
 
06:31:59.030 --> 06:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm not aware that um local school
 
06:32:02.690 --> 06:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
board candidates or members have to what
 
06:32:04.970 --> 06:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
do you think about that proposition
 
06:32:08.208 --> 06:32:08.218 align:start position:0%
I think I think local members filing is
 
06:32:10.788 --> 06:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
an absolutely fantastic thing I think
 
06:32:12.470 --> 06:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
that even
 
06:32:16.250 --> 06:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
um taking it down we have in my town we
 
06:32:20.048 --> 06:32:20.058 align:start position:0%
have people that change their party
 
06:32:23.170 --> 06:32:23.180 align:start position:0%
before they run for a local position
 
06:32:27.170 --> 06:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
because they know we have this many of
 
06:32:29.390 --> 06:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
this party and we have that many of that
 
06:32:31.070 --> 06:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
party and I'm going to change my party
 
06:32:32.628 --> 06:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
because anyone who's going to do due
 
06:32:34.548 --> 06:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
diligence will go to the town figure out
 
06:32:36.830 --> 06:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
what party I am and vote for me
 
06:32:39.708 --> 06:32:39.718 align:start position:0%
so I do believe that it should be that
 
06:32:41.330 --> 06:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
transparent at this point are there
 
06:32:43.490 --> 06:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:32:48.430 --> 06:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:52.850 --> 06:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:52.860 --> 06:33:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:33:00.470 --> 06:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:02.990 --> 06:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
I have never done this before
 
06:33:06.230 --> 06:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh first time last year I spoke at the
 
06:33:08.570 --> 06:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
count city council here in Concord I
 
06:33:12.048 --> 06:33:12.058 align:start position:0%
live here I've lived here for about two
 
06:33:14.990 --> 06:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
and a half years and over time I have
 
06:33:17.628 --> 06:33:17.638 align:start position:0%
seen it to where it's a bigger concern
 
06:33:20.810 --> 06:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
than when I remember as a child
 
06:33:26.750 --> 06:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
as a child the school was of the quality
 
06:33:28.730 --> 06:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
of the education was always a concern
 
06:33:31.128 --> 06:33:31.138 align:start position:0%
and it's only gotten worse
 
06:33:36.128 --> 06:33:36.138 align:start position:0%
I have I'm not a parent myself but I am
 
06:33:40.190 --> 06:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
on to 14 little kids
 
06:33:42.650 --> 06:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
um all of my they're all like they call
 
06:33:44.510 --> 06:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
me on but they're actually my cousins
 
06:33:46.610 --> 06:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
but um
 
06:33:48.770 --> 06:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
three of them are not in a public school
 
06:33:52.190 --> 06:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
because of what is being taught as such
 
06:33:56.208 --> 06:33:56.218 align:start position:0%
as CRT so uh but all parents have the
 
06:33:58.548 --> 06:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
right to ask a question whether it is
 
06:34:00.470 --> 06:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
the topic of the night at the school
 
06:34:03.288 --> 06:34:03.298 align:start position:0%
board meeting it doesn't matter if you
 
06:34:05.208 --> 06:34:05.218 align:start position:0%
are a school board member then you know
 
06:34:06.830 --> 06:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
what the
 
06:34:10.430 --> 06:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
the topic is about whether you are
 
06:34:14.090 --> 06:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
researching it or whether you are quite
 
06:34:17.390 --> 06:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
educated in it Bad pun intended
 
06:34:21.288 --> 06:34:21.298 align:start position:0%
um so you are supposed to be able to
 
06:34:24.530 --> 06:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
answer a question just as the president
 
06:34:26.750 --> 06:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
does add any
 
06:34:30.170 --> 06:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
public meeting he'll answer a question
 
06:34:32.690 --> 06:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
and whether it's about the topic at hand
 
06:34:34.788 --> 06:34:34.798 align:start position:0%
or not so why can't a school board
 
06:34:38.628 --> 06:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
member do that we elect them to the
 
06:34:42.708 --> 06:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
board whether they have whether we agree
 
06:34:44.570 --> 06:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
with them or not they're still elected
 
06:34:48.650 --> 06:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
and we pay their bill we pay their
 
06:34:52.128 --> 06:34:52.138 align:start position:0%
um their pay so they should be able to
 
06:34:56.570 --> 06:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
answer a question and so I also do not
 
06:34:58.788 --> 06:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
agree that
 
06:35:01.128 --> 06:35:01.138 align:start position:0%
um the meetings get heated and the cops
 
06:35:02.090 --> 06:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
are called
 
06:35:03.948 --> 06:35:03.958 align:start position:0%
with any
 
06:35:08.288 --> 06:35:08.298 align:start position:0%
with any discussion has to become
 
06:35:11.270 --> 06:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
civil and it has to be protective
 
06:35:13.490 --> 06:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
because if you're going to start yelling
 
06:35:15.590 --> 06:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
and screaming it's not productive and
 
06:35:18.410 --> 06:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
nothing will get done and no opinion
 
06:35:21.350 --> 06:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
will be getting across because there's a
 
06:35:23.990 --> 06:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
lot of anger so
 
06:35:26.750 --> 06:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
um whether it's the topic or not it
 
06:35:28.250 --> 06:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
needs to be answered and I'm not talking
 
06:35:31.610 --> 06:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
about an hour answering it I'm talking
 
06:35:35.570 --> 06:35:35.580 align:start position:0%
30 minutes or little less so I don't see
 
06:35:38.030 --> 06:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
the big deal in that so why is that
 
06:35:41.628 --> 06:35:41.638 align:start position:0%
topic you coming up as a debate here at
 
06:35:44.030 --> 06:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
this meeting today it should be obvious
 
06:35:46.610 --> 06:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
answer the question and move on
 
06:35:48.590 --> 06:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
and that's it thank you very much are
 
06:35:51.530 --> 06:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
06:35:55.250 --> 06:35:55.260 align:start position:0%

06:37:03.170 --> 06:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
not really a question directly if he's
 
06:37:05.570 --> 06:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
making a point there are times I've
 
06:37:07.548 --> 06:37:07.558 align:start position:0%
emailed members of this committee and
 
06:37:09.110 --> 06:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
not gotten a response of times I've
 
06:37:10.788 --> 06:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
emailed other legislators and have not
 
06:37:12.948 --> 06:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
gotten a response
 
06:37:12.958 --> 06:37:13.730 align:start position:0%
gotten a response
um

06:37:13.730 --> 06:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:17.930 --> 06:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
so uh the to the point of the bill aside
 
06:37:20.030 --> 06:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
from some of the other absurdities there
 
06:37:22.128 --> 06:37:22.138 align:start position:0%
are a handful policies school boards
 
06:37:24.230 --> 06:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
don't have um I bet school boards have
 
06:37:26.150 --> 06:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
on file that don't have a direct
 
06:37:27.708 --> 06:37:27.718 align:start position:0%
correlation to any Department of
 
06:37:29.570 --> 06:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
Education regulation or any state
 
06:37:32.270 --> 06:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
statute I I thought of just holding up
 
06:37:34.250 --> 06:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
my phone and showing like my testimony
 
06:37:37.610 --> 06:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
from last year but we'll go through this
 
06:37:41.628 --> 06:37:41.638 align:start position:0%
sample policy bbab roles and duties of
 
06:37:43.730 --> 06:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
the board chairperson there's nothing in
 
06:37:45.530 --> 06:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
law that allows a school board to elect
 
06:37:48.530 --> 06:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
a chairperson or officers uniquely the
 
06:37:50.110 --> 06:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
SAU statute
 
06:37:52.670 --> 06:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
rsa194-c does does call for the election
 
06:37:54.948 --> 06:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
of officers but nothing in RSA 189
 
06:37:56.750 --> 06:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
relative to single District school
 
06:37:59.390 --> 06:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
boards that have officers so I don't
 
06:38:00.288 --> 06:38:00.298 align:start position:0%
know who's going to run the meeting
 
06:38:02.090 --> 06:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
there's no provision to have a chair or
 
06:38:05.230 --> 06:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
a vice chair or secretary or a clerk
 
06:38:07.788 --> 06:38:07.798 align:start position:0%
bdg School attorney there's no statute
 
06:38:09.530 --> 06:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
that specifically authorizes a school
 
06:38:12.368 --> 06:38:12.378 align:start position:0%
board to hire an attorney
 
06:38:14.868 --> 06:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
b-e-d-d-a board meeting rules of
 
06:38:16.670 --> 06:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
procedure there's no statute that
 
06:38:18.350 --> 06:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
specifically allows a school board to
 
06:38:19.970 --> 06:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
adopt rules of procedures such as
 
06:38:22.128 --> 06:38:22.138 align:start position:0%
Robert's Rules or some amended rules or
 
06:38:22.138 --> 06:38:23.330 align:start position:0%
Robert's Rules or some amended rules or

06:38:23.330 --> 06:38:23.340 align:start position:0%

06:38:25.850 --> 06:38:25.860 align:start position:0%
Bia new board new board member
 
06:38:27.530 --> 06:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
orientation there's nothing a law that
 
06:38:28.850 --> 06:38:28.860 align:start position:0%
allows a new school board member to
 
06:38:31.250 --> 06:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
undergo some sort of orientation with
 
06:38:32.890 --> 06:38:32.900 align:start position:0%
their local school board
 
06:38:36.230 --> 06:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
jfab foreign exchange students I could
 
06:38:37.970 --> 06:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
be wrong maybe there's a state statute
 
06:38:40.070 --> 06:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
that allows for school boards to accept
 
06:38:41.810 --> 06:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
foreign exchange students if there is
 
06:38:43.970 --> 06:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of it I presume it would
 
06:38:45.770 --> 06:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
be in the education statute so if there
 
06:38:47.030 --> 06:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
is I would appreciate if somebody could
 
06:38:48.850 --> 06:38:48.860 align:start position:0%
let me know what that is
 
06:38:50.990 --> 06:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
jiba student government there's nothing
 
06:38:53.030 --> 06:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
in law that allows um high schools to
 
06:38:54.470 --> 06:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
have sort of a student government
 
06:38:56.330 --> 06:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
process or system
 
06:38:58.850 --> 06:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
KD School District social media websites
 
06:39:00.110 --> 06:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
or something a lot that allows the
 
06:39:02.030 --> 06:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
school district to have a website
 
06:39:05.868 --> 06:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
KDC website publishing same thing here's
 
06:39:07.190 --> 06:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
one that's near and dear to our hearts
 
06:39:08.930 --> 06:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
we discussed this the other day sample
 
06:39:11.090 --> 06:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
policy kec reconsideration of
 
06:39:13.548 --> 06:39:13.558 align:start position:0%
instructional materials there's nothing
 
06:39:16.548 --> 06:39:16.558 align:start position:0%
in statute that specifically allows or
 
06:39:18.110 --> 06:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
requires a school board to review
 
06:39:20.150 --> 06:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
instructional course materials with a
 
06:39:21.830 --> 06:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
parent complains about them so I guess
 
06:39:22.910 --> 06:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
we don't need to listen to those
 
06:39:24.590 --> 06:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
complaints until representative
 
06:39:25.910 --> 06:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
cordelli's Bill maybe has some
 
06:39:28.610 --> 06:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
amendments and gets through KF use of
 
06:39:30.230 --> 06:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
school buildings and Facilities there's
 
06:39:31.548 --> 06:39:31.558 align:start position:0%
nothing in law that allows the school
 
06:39:33.350 --> 06:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
board to rent out space in its facility
 
06:39:36.230 --> 06:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
to the town for the basketball the youth
 
06:39:38.270 --> 06:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
basketball program the Bible Club wants
 
06:39:40.190 --> 06:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
to come in uh you know some other
 
06:39:41.810 --> 06:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
outside organization wants to come in
 
06:39:43.670 --> 06:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
and run space so we'll stop doing that
 
06:39:45.048 --> 06:39:45.058 align:start position:0%
since there's no law that specifically
 
06:39:48.410 --> 06:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
authorizes us to do that the other
 
06:39:51.948 --> 06:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
aspect a couple of Provisions relative
 
06:39:54.590 --> 06:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
to the law specifically paragraphs line
 
06:39:57.048 --> 06:39:57.058 align:start position:0%
25 paragraph
 
06:39:59.810 --> 06:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
um five members of the public May file a
 
06:40:01.368 --> 06:40:01.378 align:start position:0%
complaint with the commissioner of the
 
06:40:03.250 --> 06:40:03.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Education of Education
 
06:40:05.448 --> 06:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
parents are already doing that if
 
06:40:07.250 --> 06:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
there's a statute that allows them to do
 
06:40:08.690 --> 06:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
that currently I'd like to know what
 
06:40:10.850 --> 06:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
that is too if that's again an education
 
06:40:13.190 --> 06:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
statute I know Miss Fenton is here maybe
 
06:40:15.890 --> 06:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
she she can answer some of these for me
 
06:40:19.788 --> 06:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
um the uh the the other point a question
 
06:40:22.010 --> 06:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
was asked and response was given our
 
06:40:23.570 --> 06:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
elected school board members accountable
 
06:40:25.788 --> 06:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner again show me that
 
06:40:28.430 --> 06:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
statute because I'm not aware of any if
 
06:40:31.430 --> 06:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
they are so again this is the same bill
 
06:40:32.990 --> 06:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
that was introduced last year that was
 
06:40:34.730 --> 06:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
unanimous out of committee and expedient
 
06:40:36.770 --> 06:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
to legislate I don't understand what's
 
06:40:39.770 --> 06:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
changed we have the law last year Senate
 
06:40:42.230 --> 06:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 410 that requires public comment
 
06:40:45.048 --> 06:40:45.058 align:start position:0%
periods we've amended our sample policy
 
06:40:47.628 --> 06:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
school boards are implementing that uh
 
06:40:49.070 --> 06:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
we oppose the bill I'm happy to answer
 
06:40:50.810 --> 06:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much
 
06:40:52.788 --> 06:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
06:40:54.530 --> 06:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here once
 
06:40:57.288 --> 06:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
again do you have a ballpark about maybe
 
06:40:59.330 --> 06:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
how many scoreboards across the state
 
06:41:01.250 --> 06:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
already Implement a best practice
 
06:41:05.090 --> 06:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
perhaps of allowing time for Testimony
 
06:41:07.368 --> 06:41:07.378 align:start position:0%
comments questions Etc sure thank you
 
06:41:08.150 --> 06:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
very much for the question
 
06:41:11.090 --> 06:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative current Law requires this
 
06:41:13.390 --> 06:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
was adopted last year it's RSA
 
06:41:17.330 --> 06:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
189 colon 74. and if you look at your
 
06:41:19.430 --> 06:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
local school board sample policies it
 
06:41:21.170 --> 06:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
will be policy
 
06:41:23.330 --> 06:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
not sample policies or just to go
 
06:41:24.708 --> 06:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
circuit wouldn't have sample policies I
 
06:41:26.690 --> 06:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
have sample policies it should be that
 
06:41:28.850 --> 06:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
the call letters should be b as in boy
 
06:41:31.310 --> 06:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
E's and elephant d as in David H's and
 
06:41:31.320 --> 06:41:32.890 align:start position:0%
E's and elephant d as in David H's and
Henry

06:41:32.890 --> 06:41:32.900 align:start position:0%
Henry
 
06:41:35.090 --> 06:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
b-e-d-h- that's the code that we use for
 
06:41:37.070 --> 06:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
our sample policies
 
06:41:39.830 --> 06:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
um uh so our our sample policy has some
 
06:41:41.868 --> 06:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
optional Provisions in it so I don't
 
06:41:43.490 --> 06:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
know exactly what the Salem school board
 
06:41:45.288 --> 06:41:45.298 align:start position:0%
has adopted but I know your board
 
06:41:47.330 --> 06:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
usually been pretty good on on policy
 
06:41:48.650 --> 06:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
work so I would imagine that they're in
 
06:41:50.208 --> 06:41:50.218 align:start position:0%
compliance with the law relative to that
 
06:41:51.830 --> 06:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you I'm going
 
06:41:53.510 --> 06:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
to answer the this of your question how
 
06:41:54.890 --> 06:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
many well every school board should have
 
06:41:56.868 --> 06:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
the policy relative to public comments
 
06:41:58.910 --> 06:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
30 minutes for a public comment period
 
06:42:01.610 --> 06:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
is typical in terms of the Q a back and
 
06:42:03.470 --> 06:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
forth I mean part of that depends on the
 
06:42:04.610 --> 06:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
nature of the question part of that
 
06:42:05.868 --> 06:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
depends on the number of people that are
 
06:42:07.310 --> 06:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
at the school board meeting you know
 
06:42:09.170 --> 06:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
I've been to school board meetings where
 
06:42:10.910 --> 06:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
the the gentleman I believe tested by
 
06:42:12.590 --> 06:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
that if it's a simple easy question yeah
 
06:42:14.690 --> 06:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
they'll give an answer I've also been to
 
06:42:17.750 --> 06:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
informal school board meetings where you
 
06:42:19.368 --> 06:42:19.378 align:start position:0%
know depending on the flow of the of the
 
06:42:20.810 --> 06:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
meeting and how much time they have and
 
06:42:22.670 --> 06:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
what else is on the agenda they'll sit
 
06:42:24.110 --> 06:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
there and have a conversation with it
 
06:42:26.330 --> 06:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
with the person it's not even a formal q
 
06:42:28.368 --> 06:42:28.378 align:start position:0%
a right they're sending somebody they're
 
06:42:30.470 --> 06:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
talking about a budget or a policy and
 
06:42:32.690 --> 06:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
there's one person in the audience they
 
06:42:34.250 --> 06:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
say hey excuse me Mr chair can you
 
06:42:35.448 --> 06:42:35.458 align:start position:0%
repeat that can you I didn't quite hear
 
06:42:36.770 --> 06:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
you or I didn't see where you're going
 
06:42:38.150 --> 06:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
with that or can you give me that number
 
06:42:40.788 --> 06:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
again and they and they do it informally
 
06:42:42.830 --> 06:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
you know the reasons we had to put in
 
06:42:46.010 --> 06:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
some some stringent rules relative to
 
06:42:47.810 --> 06:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
public comments as we I talked about
 
06:42:49.910 --> 06:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
this last year on a couple bills because
 
06:42:53.270 --> 06:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
in 2021 and 2022 we had hundreds of
 
06:42:55.730 --> 06:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
people showing up a lot of them not even
 
06:42:57.590 --> 06:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
from that Community you want to talk
 
06:43:00.048 --> 06:43:00.058 align:start position:0%
about why you travel 60 miles to come to
 
06:43:01.670 --> 06:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
a school board that meeting that is in
 
06:43:02.930 --> 06:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
your community because you want to
 
06:43:04.670 --> 06:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
complain about masks and be disruptive
 
06:43:07.490 --> 06:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's why that happened so but anyway
 
06:43:09.890 --> 06:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
we had to put parameters around public
 
06:43:11.628 --> 06:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
comment meetings because we had 200
 
06:43:13.670 --> 06:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
people at the meetings yelling screaming
 
06:43:15.650 --> 06:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
being disruptive threatening school
 
06:43:17.390 --> 06:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
board members who had no interest in
 
06:43:18.948 --> 06:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
letting the board get his business done
 
06:43:21.948 --> 06:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
and no no interest in actually asking
 
06:43:24.230 --> 06:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
legitimate questions that's why we had
 
06:43:25.910 --> 06:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
06:43:27.890 --> 06:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
and now we have a public comment period
 
06:43:30.048 --> 06:43:30.058 align:start position:0%
to address that issue from Pam from from
 
06:43:32.090 --> 06:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
from the pandemic we have a statute
 
06:43:33.650 --> 06:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
requiring public comments how many
 
06:43:35.090 --> 06:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
people go to the right Europe school
 
06:43:36.230 --> 06:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
board meetings now we're back down to
 
06:43:37.368 --> 06:43:37.378 align:start position:0%
two or three people at the regular
 
06:43:39.708 --> 06:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
school board meetings correct I see
 
06:43:42.110 --> 06:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
United representative so we went through
 
06:43:44.930 --> 06:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
that rigging rule two bills last year I
 
06:43:47.208 --> 06:43:47.218 align:start position:0%
wrote the amendment we got it in place
 
06:43:48.650 --> 06:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
and now we're back to two people with
 
06:43:50.170 --> 06:43:50.180 align:start position:0%
any school board meetings again because
 
06:43:52.430 --> 06:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
covert is over and we're asking people
 
06:43:54.770 --> 06:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
to to mask or you know get some fresh
 
06:43:57.230 --> 06:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
air or whatnot so
 
06:43:59.448 --> 06:43:59.458 align:start position:0%
Barrett I have a question for you
 
06:44:01.970 --> 06:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
um the bill starts out on line four with
 
06:44:03.948 --> 06:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
during any public meeting I'd like to
 
06:44:07.548 --> 06:44:07.558 align:start position:0%
discuss this just that terminology alone
 
06:44:10.850 --> 06:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
um having been on a school board select
 
06:44:13.548 --> 06:44:13.558 align:start position:0%
board city council this right here
 
06:44:15.708 --> 06:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
there's a number of meetings which we
 
06:44:18.170 --> 06:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
have are for training purpose of new
 
06:44:22.368 --> 06:44:22.378 align:start position:0%
Personnel or it can be a work session
 
06:44:25.128 --> 06:44:25.138 align:start position:0%
um is is it your understanding that by
 
06:44:27.410 --> 06:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
reading this that if we have a special
 
06:44:29.448 --> 06:44:29.458 align:start position:0%
meeting set up for the purpose of
 
06:44:31.850 --> 06:44:31.860 align:start position:0%
training and bringing folks in to do the
 
06:44:33.770 --> 06:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
training of new school board members
 
06:44:36.470 --> 06:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
that we would have to have this comment
 
06:44:36.480 --> 06:44:38.330 align:start position:0%
that we would have to have this comment
period

06:44:38.330 --> 06:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
period
 
06:44:40.310 --> 06:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Mr chair yes
 
06:44:44.448 --> 06:44:44.458 align:start position:0%
according to RSA 18974 even even if it's
 
06:44:45.948 --> 06:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
even if the board is not working through
 
06:44:47.208 --> 06:44:47.218 align:start position:0%
its quote-unquote regular business
 
06:44:49.128 --> 06:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
you're onboarding new school board
 
06:44:51.170 --> 06:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
members you're meeting with the the
 
06:44:51.180 --> 06:44:52.250 align:start position:0%
members you're meeting with the the
teachers

06:44:52.250 --> 06:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
06:44:53.690 --> 06:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
um or some school board will have what
 
06:44:55.670 --> 06:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
they call a budget Workshop where it's
 
06:44:57.288 --> 06:44:57.298 align:start position:0%
not a regular board meeting but tonight
 
06:44:58.910 --> 06:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
they're only spending two or three hours
 
06:45:01.250 --> 06:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
working on the budget
 
06:45:02.750 --> 06:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
um whether you call it a workshop
 
06:45:04.850 --> 06:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
whether you call it an informal meeting
 
06:45:07.128 --> 06:45:07.138 align:start position:0%
it's a meeting under the under the right
 
06:45:09.850 --> 06:45:09.860 align:start position:0%
to know law and so the language of
 
06:45:12.350 --> 06:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
189.74 the school board public comment
 
06:45:14.448 --> 06:45:14.458 align:start position:0%
period Bill School Board shall provide
 
06:45:16.548 --> 06:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for public to comment on
 
06:45:18.530 --> 06:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
School District matters at a meeting of
 
06:45:21.410 --> 06:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
the school board held under RSA 91a2 so
 
06:45:22.610 --> 06:45:22.620 align:start position:0%
it's still a meeting under the school
 
06:45:24.288 --> 06:45:24.298 align:start position:0%
board even if you're just having your
 
06:45:25.610 --> 06:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
budget hearing tonight we're only
 
06:45:27.470 --> 06:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
working on the budget it's still a
 
06:45:29.930 --> 06:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
public meeting under RSA 91a2 and you do
 
06:45:31.970 --> 06:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
have to allow for and provide public
 
06:45:31.980 --> 06:45:32.990 align:start position:0%
have to allow for and provide public
comment

06:45:32.990 --> 06:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
comment
 
06:45:36.410 --> 06:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
I I understand the you know public right
 
06:45:40.070 --> 06:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
public rights right to know and be there
 
06:45:42.170 --> 06:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
we had an orientation for this group
 
06:45:43.430 --> 06:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
right here
 
06:45:45.110 --> 06:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
over at
 
06:45:47.390 --> 06:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
Granite State College that's a public
 
06:45:49.730 --> 06:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
meeting yes I would I would argue it is
 
06:45:51.770 --> 06:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
yes well I would that was in the
 
06:45:53.650 --> 06:45:53.660 align:start position:0%
calendar it was noticed in the accounts
 
06:45:58.010 --> 06:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
however that is for doe to present to us
 
06:46:00.948 --> 06:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
no action was taken
 
06:46:04.030 --> 06:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
is it necessary then that we you know
 
06:46:06.288 --> 06:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
you know acknowledge all these different
 
06:46:09.048 --> 06:46:09.058 align:start position:0%
questions at that meeting which has a
 
06:46:12.110 --> 06:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
whole different purpose right right so I
 
06:46:14.208 --> 06:46:14.218 align:start position:0%
mean you know I I mean yeah I would
 
06:46:15.948 --> 06:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
argue that that was a public meeting of
 
06:46:18.468 --> 06:46:18.478 align:start position:0%
this body House Education committee but
 
06:46:20.448 --> 06:46:20.458 align:start position:0%
you know and that should also be
 
06:46:21.948 --> 06:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
distinguished what we're doing right now
 
06:46:24.468 --> 06:46:24.478 align:start position:0%
is not a meeting this is a hearing yes
 
06:46:26.570 --> 06:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction between the two a
 
06:46:29.150 --> 06:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
meeting is when the public body whether
 
06:46:30.530 --> 06:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
or not it's your school board your
 
06:46:32.990 --> 06:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
select board your city council the Water
 
06:46:36.048 --> 06:46:36.058 align:start position:0%
Commission the library trustees
 
06:46:37.910 --> 06:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
um are doing their business adopting
 
06:46:40.190 --> 06:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
policies adopting the budget receiving
 
06:46:43.310 --> 06:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
reports a hearing implies that the
 
06:46:44.990 --> 06:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
public has the right to speak such as
 
06:46:48.170 --> 06:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
your budget hearing under RSA 32 colon 5
 
06:46:50.628 --> 06:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
I believe it is if one person shows up
 
06:46:52.310 --> 06:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
at your public hearing or your budget
 
06:46:54.890 --> 06:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
hearing you just let them speak if 500
 
06:46:56.930 --> 06:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
people show up at your budget hearing
 
06:46:58.250 --> 06:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
you have to let them speak the same way
 
06:47:00.110 --> 06:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
we had with you know some of the the the
 
06:47:02.510 --> 06:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
firearms bills yesterday and some of the
 
06:47:04.730 --> 06:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
voucher bills we get 200 people that
 
06:47:06.468 --> 06:47:06.478 align:start position:0%
sign up you have to let them speak
 
06:47:08.208 --> 06:47:08.218 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between a hearing
 
06:47:10.010 --> 06:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
and a meeting
 
06:47:13.070 --> 06:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
um but you know relative to what I just
 
06:47:15.048 --> 06:47:15.058 align:start position:0%
said why is this just being directed at
 
06:47:17.208 --> 06:47:17.218 align:start position:0%
school boards I've you know brought this
 
06:47:18.708 --> 06:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
forward before with the public comment
 
06:47:20.570 --> 06:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
Bill last year a handful of other bills
 
06:47:21.948 --> 06:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
that are aimed solely at school
 
06:47:24.590 --> 06:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
districts in school boards if this is
 
06:47:26.690 --> 06:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
such a good idea why don't we extend it
 
06:47:29.208 --> 06:47:29.218 align:start position:0%
to city council select board Library
 
06:47:31.850 --> 06:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
trustees and any of the other thousands
 
06:47:33.288 --> 06:47:33.298 align:start position:0%
how about how about the State Board of
 
06:47:35.208 --> 06:47:35.218 align:start position:0%
Education as well too I'd like to be
 
06:47:38.208 --> 06:47:38.218 align:start position:0%
able to stand up and ask Mr Mr Klein the
 
06:47:39.410 --> 06:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
commissioner a handful of questions and
 
06:47:41.690 --> 06:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
demand answers on the spot how's that
 
06:47:44.990 --> 06:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
going to fly state agencies Library
 
06:47:48.230 --> 06:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
trustees so on and so forth
 
06:47:50.990 --> 06:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
further questions representative uh
 
06:47:54.468 --> 06:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
right try excuse me thank you Mr
 
06:47:57.110 --> 06:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you I I don't want more
 
06:47:58.788 --> 06:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
to go I mean to be facetious I was
 
06:48:01.250 --> 06:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
trying to to be Clerk and listen at the
 
06:48:03.548 --> 06:48:03.558 align:start position:0%
same time but that list of
 
06:48:06.890 --> 06:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
alphabetes policies I didn't get why you
 
06:48:09.110 --> 06:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
were doing that list the list of
 
06:48:09.120 --> 06:48:10.670 align:start position:0%
were doing that list the list of
policies

06:48:10.670 --> 06:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
policies
 
06:48:13.250 --> 06:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
um the the the the coded policies that I
 
06:48:14.230 --> 06:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
was reading
 
06:48:17.390 --> 06:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
those policies don't have any there's no
 
06:48:18.890 --> 06:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
statute or Department of Education
 
06:48:21.770 --> 06:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
regulation that authorizes or allows the
 
06:48:23.628 --> 06:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
school board to have a policy on those
 
06:48:26.090 --> 06:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
topics and the bill says you can only
 
06:48:28.128 --> 06:48:28.138 align:start position:0%
have a policy that is tied back to a
 
06:48:31.430 --> 06:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
state regulation or a state statute it
 
06:48:31.440 --> 06:48:32.948 align:start position:0%
state regulation or a state statute it
says

06:48:32.948 --> 06:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
says
 
06:48:35.208 --> 06:48:35.218 align:start position:0%

06:48:51.048 --> 06:48:51.058 align:start position:0%
Authority described in their school
 
06:48:53.390 --> 06:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
policy or operational procedure the
 
06:48:54.830 --> 06:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
school board shall immediately respond
 
06:48:57.288 --> 06:48:57.298 align:start position:0%
with the citation to its Authority if
 
06:48:58.968 --> 06:48:58.978 align:start position:0%
the school board is unable to respond
 
06:49:00.948 --> 06:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
affirmatively that there is such a New
 
06:49:03.230 --> 06:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute or administrative rule
 
06:49:05.150 --> 06:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
the school policy or operational
 
06:49:07.368 --> 06:49:07.378 align:start position:0%
procedure shall be immediately withdrawn
 
06:49:09.288 --> 06:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
until such time that the school board
 
06:49:12.230 --> 06:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
can show it does have such Authority the
 
06:49:14.390 --> 06:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
policies that I read off don't have any
 
06:49:16.190 --> 06:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
basis they're a matter of common law and
 
06:49:18.410 --> 06:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
practice and allowances of public bodies
 
06:49:20.930 --> 06:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
so that's why we have policies that
 
06:49:23.288 --> 06:49:23.298 align:start position:0%
don't have any tie back to a specific
 
06:49:25.968 --> 06:49:25.978 align:start position:0%
statute or regulation the implication is
 
06:49:28.010 --> 06:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
that through this bill is that you can't
 
06:49:30.650 --> 06:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
have policies that don't have a basis in
 
06:49:32.990 --> 06:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
statute or administrative rule okay can
 
06:49:34.788 --> 06:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
I have just a quick follow-up yes all
 
06:49:37.010 --> 06:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
right so administrative rule is
 
06:49:40.070 --> 06:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
different than regulation the rule
 
06:49:41.570 --> 06:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
regulation is used interchangeably
 
06:49:43.368 --> 06:49:43.378 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for clearing
 
06:49:43.378 --> 06:49:45.410 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for clearing
yes

06:49:45.410 --> 06:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:49:48.708 --> 06:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
yes representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
06:49:49.910 --> 06:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for that testimony
 
06:49:51.708 --> 06:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
it did clear it up as far as my earlier
 
06:49:52.850 --> 06:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
question about
 
06:49:54.770 --> 06:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
some of these mundane things that might
 
06:49:57.110 --> 06:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
not be existing but I wanted to go back
 
06:49:59.030 --> 06:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
because you had mentioned specifically
 
06:50:00.830 --> 06:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
masking policies and I'm trying to
 
06:50:02.390 --> 06:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
remember because I wasn't obviously here
 
06:50:04.730 --> 06:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
in this committee there was a period in
 
06:50:08.570 --> 06:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
time in which this the things such as
 
06:50:10.430 --> 06:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
masking policies were in fact
 
06:50:12.530 --> 06:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
disseminated down to school boards to
 
06:50:14.628 --> 06:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
make decisions about is that right thank
 
06:50:16.128 --> 06:50:16.138 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative the
 
06:50:17.868 --> 06:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the uh commissioner
 
06:50:19.730 --> 06:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
Edward blue and the governor both said
 
06:50:21.230 --> 06:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
that there will be no mandate from the
 
06:50:22.548 --> 06:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
state and that it was a matter of local
 
06:50:24.468 --> 06:50:24.478 align:start position:0%
decision the local school board and each
 
06:50:25.968 --> 06:50:25.978 align:start position:0%
local community could decide whether or
 
06:50:30.468 --> 06:50:30.478 align:start position:0%
not to mandate or allow masking
 
06:50:33.110 --> 06:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
if I may just real briefly so
 
06:50:35.330 --> 06:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
obviously being of a matter for local
 
06:50:37.250 --> 06:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
control on that one
 
06:50:39.048 --> 06:50:39.058 align:start position:0%
parents showing up and asking questions
 
06:50:40.250 --> 06:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
about them those are obviously
 
06:50:42.350 --> 06:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
legitimate questions right certainly
 
06:50:44.390 --> 06:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
06:50:46.968 --> 06:50:46.978 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you thank
 
06:50:48.890 --> 06:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
you um for being here
 
06:50:50.330 --> 06:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
um first of all just a correction we we
 
06:50:51.830 --> 06:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
don't have any vouchers in New Hampshire
 
06:50:51.840 --> 06:50:54.468 align:start position:0%
don't have any vouchers in New Hampshire
secondly

06:50:54.468 --> 06:50:54.478 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
06:50:57.230 --> 06:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry but it's a fact all right
 
06:50:59.750 --> 06:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking facts here wouldn't you
 
06:51:02.208 --> 06:51:02.218 align:start position:0%
agree that maybe this bill and other
 
06:51:06.190 --> 06:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
similar were put forward on a basis of
 
06:51:09.708 --> 06:51:09.718 align:start position:0%
frustration because there were incidents
 
06:51:09.718 --> 06:51:11.208 align:start position:0%
frustration because there were incidents
where

06:51:11.208 --> 06:51:11.218 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:51:15.468 --> 06:51:15.478 align:start position:0%
um maybe things got heated in school
 
06:51:17.330 --> 06:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
board meetings during that period of
 
06:51:17.340 --> 06:51:18.890 align:start position:0%
board meetings during that period of
time

06:51:18.890 --> 06:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:51:22.910 --> 06:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
um and so this is a response to to that
 
06:51:25.150 --> 06:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
and frustrations
 
06:51:27.890 --> 06:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
during that period
 
06:51:27.900 --> 06:51:28.610 align:start position:0%
during that period
um

06:51:28.610 --> 06:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:31.670 --> 06:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
on both sides because I know of a local
 
06:51:34.190 --> 06:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
situation where parents were threatened
 
06:51:35.930 --> 06:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
and being reported to the Attorney
 
06:51:37.910 --> 06:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
General's office for requesting
 
06:51:40.490 --> 06:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
curriculum materials so I wouldn't you
 
06:51:42.288 --> 06:51:42.298 align:start position:0%
agree that it's a two-way street in
 
06:51:43.788 --> 06:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
06:51:47.030 --> 06:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
um respect between parents and board
 
06:51:48.288 --> 06:51:48.298 align:start position:0%
members thank you for the question
 
06:51:50.868 --> 06:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
representative there are thousands of
 
06:51:52.968 --> 06:51:52.978 align:start position:0%
school board meetings every single year
 
06:51:55.190 --> 06:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
across the state thousands of public
 
06:51:57.170 --> 06:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
meetings by thousands of public bodies
 
06:51:59.390 --> 06:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
across the state we've heard of a couple
 
06:52:01.788 --> 06:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
people that don't specifically like a
 
06:52:03.410 --> 06:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
response from their particular school
 
06:52:05.448 --> 06:52:05.458 align:start position:0%
board and we also heard responses that
 
06:52:06.890 --> 06:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
in some of those communities the same
 
06:52:08.208 --> 06:52:08.218 align:start position:0%
people keep getting elected to the
 
06:52:11.270 --> 06:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:13.310 --> 06:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:52:15.468 --> 06:52:15.478 align:start position:0%
not yes represent Woodcock thank you
 
06:52:18.230 --> 06:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
chairman I just want uh Mr Crusader can
 
06:52:20.868 --> 06:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
can you uh imagine any problems that may
 
06:52:23.030 --> 06:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
arise if if people are allowed to come
 
06:52:24.770 --> 06:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
and question or complain about anything
 
06:52:26.090 --> 06:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
the start of the school board agenda
 
06:52:28.430 --> 06:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question I mean it's
 
06:52:31.310 --> 06:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
School Board School Board public comment
 
06:52:33.468 --> 06:52:33.478 align:start position:0%
um uh uh Provisions are dictated by
 
06:52:35.930 --> 06:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
local school board policies there are a
 
06:52:37.788 --> 06:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
lot of variations in there I mean you
 
06:52:40.430 --> 06:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
can do I as I mentioned last year you
 
06:52:41.810 --> 06:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
can do a full day seminar on First
 
06:52:43.310 --> 06:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment laws it relates to public
 
06:52:45.048 --> 06:52:45.058 align:start position:0%
comment periods most School Board
 
06:52:47.330 --> 06:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
policies have have most school boards
 
06:52:49.788 --> 06:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's in New Hampshire or
 
06:52:52.250 --> 06:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
nationally have policies that restrict
 
06:52:55.430 --> 06:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
or otherwise a limit an ability of a of
 
06:52:57.530 --> 06:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
a the ability of a member of the public
 
06:53:00.110 --> 06:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
to come and publicly disparage employees
 
06:53:03.468 --> 06:53:03.478 align:start position:0%
our right to no law requires that
 
06:53:05.690 --> 06:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
um staff student matters are all
 
06:53:07.910 --> 06:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
discussed in non-public session so our
 
06:53:09.890 --> 06:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
sample policies reflect that that we're
 
06:53:12.230 --> 06:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
not allowed to come and and disclose
 
06:53:14.868 --> 06:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information or
 
06:53:17.030 --> 06:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
ironically you know disparage a second
 
06:53:18.948 --> 06:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
grade teacher because with an allegation
 
06:53:20.030 --> 06:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
about something that happened in the
 
06:53:22.010 --> 06:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
class when that teacher is not allowed
 
06:53:24.230 --> 06:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
by law to respond because they have an
 
06:53:25.788 --> 06:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
obligation to protect child privacy
 
06:53:28.010 --> 06:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
under FERPA and other various
 
06:53:31.670 --> 06:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
information uh you know privacy laws
 
06:53:32.868 --> 06:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:53:35.150 --> 06:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
further questions of the school boards
 
06:53:35.160 --> 06:53:37.070 align:start position:0%
further questions of the school boards
Association

06:53:37.070 --> 06:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
Association
 
06:53:40.010 --> 06:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you yeah
 
06:53:41.990 --> 06:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh we have one card left on this bill
 
06:53:43.610 --> 06:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
the department are there any questions
 
06:53:47.510 --> 06:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:05.208 --> 06:54:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:07.310 --> 06:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
may I
 
06:54:09.890 --> 06:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
um yeah yes go ahead so I I still had
 
06:54:12.110 --> 06:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
the question about line
 
06:54:14.690 --> 06:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
25 of the public May file a complaint to
 
06:54:16.368 --> 06:54:16.378 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
06:54:18.350 --> 06:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
Education about the school board because
 
06:54:20.810 --> 06:54:20.820 align:start position:0%
I I just don't think that locally
 
06:54:23.150 --> 06:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
elected school board members are
 
06:54:25.310 --> 06:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
answerable to the commissioner of
 
06:54:26.868 --> 06:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
Education are they
 
06:54:28.910 --> 06:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
for the record Diana Fenton with the
 
06:54:31.010 --> 06:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
department and you were correct thank
 
06:54:33.110 --> 06:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
you that is one of the technical issues
 
06:54:35.510 --> 06:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
the department has a concern about on
 
06:54:37.310 --> 06:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
this bill the department does not have
 
06:54:38.930 --> 06:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
any oversight over school board
 
06:54:40.788 --> 06:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
officials they are elected officials
 
06:54:43.310 --> 06:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
when you look at how that is written on
 
06:54:44.628 --> 06:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
line 25
 
06:54:46.128 --> 06:54:46.138 align:start position:0%
um the public
 
06:54:48.530 --> 06:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
can call the department and file a
 
06:54:48.540 --> 06:54:49.490 align:start position:0%
can call the department and file a
complaint

06:54:49.490 --> 06:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
06:54:51.350 --> 06:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
they are not prohibited from doing so
 
06:54:53.868 --> 06:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
currently the question is what action
 
06:54:56.810 --> 06:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
can the department take in this
 
06:54:58.788 --> 06:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
particular paragraph does not address
 
06:55:01.190 --> 06:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
that so again I reiterate and this
 
06:55:02.990 --> 06:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
question was brought up a few
 
06:55:05.570 --> 06:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions ago when a bill was
 
06:55:07.010 --> 06:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
brought forward to impose a code of
 
06:55:08.990 --> 06:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
conduct or code of ethics on school
 
06:55:11.150 --> 06:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
board members the department does not
 
06:55:12.830 --> 06:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
have any oversight we don't issue them A
 
06:55:15.530 --> 06:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
license they are elected officials and
 
06:55:17.990 --> 06:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
so we are we the department are limited
 
06:55:20.628 --> 06:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
as to what action we can take and
 
06:55:21.890 --> 06:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell you are
 
06:55:24.368 --> 06:55:24.378 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct
 
06:55:26.510 --> 06:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
further questions for the Department
 
06:55:31.250 --> 06:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:34.548 --> 06:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
so this closes that I think I see here
 
06:55:36.890 --> 06:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
629 yeah
 
06:55:39.650 --> 06:55:39.660 align:start position:0%

06:55:40.850 --> 06:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
this last one we're going to open up
 
06:55:43.670 --> 06:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:49.570 --> 06:55:49.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:56.448 --> 06:55:56.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:59.690 --> 06:55:59.700 align:start position:0%

um and that I am the last so I will try
 
06:56:15.170 --> 06:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
to make this uh fairly quickly my intent
 
06:56:16.788 --> 06:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
in bringing this bill forward is to
 
06:56:20.030 --> 06:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
bring our Focus back on students
 
06:56:24.410 --> 06:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
um and uh to bring some discourse
 
06:56:27.830 --> 06:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and and uh focus on their rights it's
 
06:56:29.930 --> 06:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
an attempt to centralize in one place
 
06:56:32.030 --> 06:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
the rights of students as guaranteed by
 
06:56:34.490 --> 06:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
our federal and state constitutions and
 
06:56:38.270 --> 06:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
statutes it's not intended to create any
 
06:56:39.590 --> 06:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
new rights
 
06:56:41.330 --> 06:56:41.340 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to
 
06:56:45.010 --> 06:56:45.020 align:start position:0%
um just read a paragraph of one of my
 
06:56:47.090 --> 06:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
constituents sent me
 
06:56:50.448 --> 06:56:50.458 align:start position:0%
um and I've I've turned it in as part of
 
06:56:54.048 --> 06:56:54.058 align:start position:0%
the testimony but she said education is
 
06:56:56.750 --> 06:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
the Bedrock of our democracy teaching
 
06:56:58.430 --> 06:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
students that they are respected members
 
06:56:59.868 --> 06:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
of our school
 
06:57:01.670 --> 06:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
that their voice is worth listening to
 
06:57:04.250 --> 06:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
that their ideas may have Merit that
 
06:57:06.230 --> 06:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
they have rights guaranteed in the U.S
 
06:57:08.330 --> 06:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire constitutions
 
06:57:10.610 --> 06:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
help them to become active members of
 
06:57:12.530 --> 06:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
their school and communities and then to
 
06:57:16.010 --> 06:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
become active citizens as adults our
 
06:57:18.468 --> 06:57:18.478 align:start position:0%
democracy needs a citizenry which
 
06:57:19.610 --> 06:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
understands our rights and
 
06:57:21.890 --> 06:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
responsibility understands our
 
06:57:23.930 --> 06:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
government how our government works and
 
06:57:25.368 --> 06:57:25.378 align:start position:0%
the system of checks and balances
 
06:57:28.208 --> 06:57:28.218 align:start position:0%
between the three branches of government
 
06:57:30.770 --> 06:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
will vote and participate in our
 
06:57:30.780 --> 06:57:31.850 align:start position:0%
will vote and participate in our
government

06:57:31.850 --> 06:57:31.860 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:57:33.350 --> 06:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
those who have been learning this
 
06:57:34.968 --> 06:57:34.978 align:start position:0%
knowledge and practicing the skills of
 
06:57:36.850 --> 06:57:36.860 align:start position:0%
speaking out and voting in their schools
 
06:57:38.990 --> 06:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
respecting their classmates and their
 
06:57:40.730 --> 06:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
teachers will become the adults who will
 
06:57:42.708 --> 06:57:42.718 align:start position:0%

they will be our Defenders and
 
06:57:49.128 --> 06:57:49.138 align:start position:0%
practitioners of democracy I thought
 
06:57:52.968 --> 06:57:52.978 align:start position:0%
that was worth talking about
 
06:57:55.548 --> 06:57:55.558 align:start position:0%
um and I think you know we we have been
 
06:57:57.110 --> 06:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot of bills in this
 
06:58:00.110 --> 06:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
committee already more to come uh summer
 
06:58:02.930 --> 06:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
meant uh to disrupt the system others to
 
06:58:05.090 --> 06:58:05.100 align:start position:0%
force methods or parts of the curriculum
 
06:58:07.910 --> 06:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
offering or technical bills on funding
 
06:58:10.548 --> 06:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
or special education we work on bills
 
06:58:13.310 --> 06:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
that try to Define funding adequacy and
 
06:58:16.190 --> 06:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
guard rails for academic standards uh
 
06:58:19.430 --> 06:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
bills that focus on high what how what
 
06:58:22.128 --> 06:58:22.138 align:start position:0%
and what not to teach and a bill will be
 
06:58:24.048 --> 06:58:24.058 align:start position:0%
introducing to the house on parents
 
06:58:26.270 --> 06:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
rights that list the rights already in
 
06:58:26.280 --> 06:58:27.110 align:start position:0%
rights that list the rights already in
law

06:58:27.110 --> 06:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:58:29.330 --> 06:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
and adds a required reporting of all
 
06:58:31.670 --> 06:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
conversations or actions of students to
 
06:58:33.830 --> 06:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
their parents these bills are about
 
06:58:36.110 --> 06:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
adult concerns and again
 
06:58:38.330 --> 06:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to bring
 
06:58:40.430 --> 06:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
Focus back on our students
 
06:58:44.350 --> 06:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
when I sent this bill to OLS
 
06:58:48.250 --> 06:58:48.260 align:start position:0%
and got it back at the at the last hour
 
06:58:50.690 --> 06:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
they had omitted
 
06:58:53.270 --> 06:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
the Preamble or the opening statement
 
06:58:57.048 --> 06:58:57.058 align:start position:0%
for the bill which I have as and the
 
06:58:58.610 --> 06:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
only way I could get it back in was an
 
06:59:01.250 --> 06:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
amendment which when we're in executive
 
06:59:03.350 --> 06:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
session I will be offering it to put it
 
06:59:05.448 --> 06:59:05.458 align:start position:0%
back in but I'd like to read it to you
 
06:59:08.030 --> 06:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
now so you have an understanding of why
 
06:59:11.810 --> 06:59:11.820 align:start position:0%
it's important it sets sets up why this
 
06:59:14.990 --> 06:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
bill is is what it is so it starts out
 
06:59:16.910 --> 06:59:16.920 align:start position:0%

knowledge of those rights including
 
06:59:50.030 --> 06:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
their evolution and interpretation and
 
06:59:52.250 --> 06:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
how they may be subject to extension or
 
06:59:53.990 --> 06:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
elimination through executive
 
06:59:57.288 --> 06:59:57.298 align:start position:0%

guaranteed by our federal and state
 
07:01:07.490 --> 07:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
constitution statutes and it's not
 
07:01:11.690 --> 07:01:11.700 align:start position:0%

um I'm just a curious
 
07:01:21.770 --> 07:01:21.780 align:start position:0%

07:01:24.110 --> 07:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
rights but only for public school
 
07:01:27.548 --> 07:01:27.558 align:start position:0%

07:01:57.590 --> 07:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
um that's in the state constitution part
 
07:02:00.770 --> 07:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:03.830 --> 07:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
so it's it's already listed and
 
07:02:05.510 --> 07:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
um you know there's been much written
 
07:02:07.670 --> 07:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
about obtaining happiness and what
 
07:02:11.448 --> 07:02:11.458 align:start position:0%
creates happiness and and um
 
07:02:15.708 --> 07:02:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:18.048 --> 07:02:18.058 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
07:02:20.390 --> 07:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
chair I have several questions but I'll
 
07:02:22.910 --> 07:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
start off with one you mind if I just
 
07:02:24.468 --> 07:02:24.478 align:start position:0%
take a moment I forgot to bring the
 
07:02:26.270 --> 07:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
initial bill up and right when you're
 
07:02:39.530 --> 07:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:39.540 --> 07:02:41.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:02:41.390 --> 07:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:02:46.150 --> 07:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:49.430 --> 07:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
07:02:51.910 --> 07:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
defines a few papers today
 
07:02:55.128 --> 07:02:55.138 align:start position:0%
okay I'm ready okay so I guess the first
 
07:02:56.690 --> 07:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
question I'll see if afterwards if I
 
07:02:58.430 --> 07:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
could ask another the first thing you
 
07:03:00.048 --> 07:03:00.058 align:start position:0%
mentioned that your intent is to bring
 
07:03:02.448 --> 07:03:02.458 align:start position:0%
the focus back on students yes but
 
07:03:04.070 --> 07:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
nowhere in your introduction did you
 
07:03:06.350 --> 07:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
include anything from students in terms
 
07:03:08.510 --> 07:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
of testimony so I'd like to know what
 
07:03:10.910 --> 07:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
was your method of contacting students
 
07:03:12.948 --> 07:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
to ask for their input on this
 
07:03:15.110 --> 07:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
and how is that done
 
07:03:19.128 --> 07:03:19.138 align:start position:0%
this this was a a bill that um what we
 
07:03:23.030 --> 07:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
did was uh compile uh just going through
 
07:03:24.590 --> 07:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire constitution U.S
 
07:03:27.170 --> 07:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
Constitution and and figuring out what
 
07:03:29.690 --> 07:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
rights they had there and in the statues
 
07:03:32.570 --> 07:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
it was not particularly to ask as I said
 
07:03:34.910 --> 07:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's not anything to create new so it
 
07:03:36.830 --> 07:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't to ask students what they think
 
07:03:39.288 --> 07:03:39.298 align:start position:0%
their rights are or to get their input
 
07:03:41.868 --> 07:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
it was more to enumerate them so you did
 
07:03:43.548 --> 07:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
not contact any students about a student
 
07:03:45.650 --> 07:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights is that correct okay
 
07:03:46.850 --> 07:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:03:48.590 --> 07:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
you have another question or are you
 
07:03:50.750 --> 07:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
related if that's all right well you
 
07:03:52.010 --> 07:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
said you had a couple questions right so
 
07:03:54.468 --> 07:03:54.478 align:start position:0%
yeah you might as well
 
07:03:55.788 --> 07:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
um you did mention
 
07:03:57.468 --> 07:03:57.478 align:start position:0%
um that a lot of this has to do with the
 
07:03:59.330 --> 07:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution I have that
 
07:04:00.770 --> 07:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
in front of me and also the New
 
07:04:02.628 --> 07:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state constitution I'm looking
 
07:04:05.628 --> 07:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
specifically at lines 14 through 20 on
 
07:04:07.910 --> 07:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
the first page and you noted different
 
07:04:09.590 --> 07:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
sections that are in the First Amendment
 
07:04:12.288 --> 07:04:12.298 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment 14th Amendment I'm
 
07:04:15.288 --> 07:04:15.298 align:start position:0%
curious why you picked these to include
 
07:04:17.690 --> 07:04:17.700 align:start position:0%
because there are 27 amendments in the
 
07:04:20.030 --> 07:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
U.S Constitution so I'm curious why
 
07:04:22.430 --> 07:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
specifically these listed if this is not
 
07:04:24.230 --> 07:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
to create new brights why are you
 
07:04:26.030 --> 07:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
drawing attention to just certain rights
 
07:04:28.490 --> 07:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
and not others I think it it was
 
07:04:30.890 --> 07:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
pointing out the rights that that we
 
07:04:35.510 --> 07:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
felt um students would would be more
 
07:04:37.968 --> 07:04:37.978 align:start position:0%
subjected to uh and should learn about
 
07:04:41.030 --> 07:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
them that they they were running for
 
07:04:42.468 --> 07:04:42.478 align:start position:0%
example the freedom of speech and
 
07:04:44.868 --> 07:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
publication I know that there's been in
 
07:04:47.930 --> 07:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
the past a lot of issues around student
 
07:04:50.750 --> 07:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
publication student newsletters what's
 
07:04:53.090 --> 07:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
allowed what's not and what rights they
 
07:04:55.730 --> 07:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
have and also about their protests there
 
07:04:57.350 --> 07:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
were a lot of students that protested
 
07:04:59.810 --> 07:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
about climate change and and how that
 
07:05:02.208 --> 07:05:02.218 align:start position:0%
you know how that worked out through the
 
07:05:04.070 --> 07:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
system okay thank you can I have one
 
07:05:06.230 --> 07:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
final question yes you may yes I'd like
 
07:05:08.628 --> 07:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
to draw our attention back to line 31 on
 
07:05:10.548 --> 07:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
the first page as representative
 
07:05:12.890 --> 07:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
cordelli noted it said the right to seek
 
07:05:15.230 --> 07:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
and obtain happiness I believe that
 
07:05:17.150 --> 07:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
might be misquoted I know at least in
 
07:05:18.708 --> 07:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
the Federal Constitution it's the
 
07:05:20.270 --> 07:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
pursuit of happiness because it's
 
07:05:22.070 --> 07:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
impossible for anyone to guarantee
 
07:05:24.288 --> 07:05:24.298 align:start position:0%
happiness to another individual so could
 
07:05:26.030 --> 07:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
you just remind us what you said a
 
07:05:27.410 --> 07:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
moment ago where in the New Hampshire
 
07:05:30.288 --> 07:05:30.298 align:start position:0%
Constitution it says obtain happiness so
 
07:05:32.570 --> 07:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
I can just check part one article two
 
07:05:34.310 --> 07:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
07:05:36.288 --> 07:05:36.298 align:start position:0%
that'll be it for me
 
07:05:37.850 --> 07:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
for the question mark representative
 
07:05:41.030 --> 07:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
07:05:43.010 --> 07:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
um I won't lie I could have a lot of
 
07:05:44.150 --> 07:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
questions but I'm gonna try to keep this
 
07:05:46.910 --> 07:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
focused and narrow so if I could direct
 
07:05:50.628 --> 07:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
our attention to the second page
 
07:05:54.288 --> 07:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
um starting here with line
 
07:05:56.868 --> 07:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
where are we at
 
07:06:00.530 --> 07:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
line four it says the right to absolute
 
07:06:03.590 --> 07:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
freedom of conscience in all matters of
 
07:06:06.288 --> 07:06:06.298 align:start position:0%
religious sentiment belief and worship
 
07:06:09.410 --> 07:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
so my concern here is if for instance if
 
07:06:11.570 --> 07:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
a 10 year old has absolute freedom of
 
07:06:11.580 --> 07:06:12.890 align:start position:0%
a 10 year old has absolute freedom of
conscience

07:06:12.890 --> 07:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
07:06:14.628 --> 07:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
does that mean his parents can't help
 
07:06:18.288 --> 07:06:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:21.708 --> 07:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
I think that's a
 
07:06:24.468 --> 07:06:24.478 align:start position:0%
that's that's taking that sentence
 
07:06:27.170 --> 07:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
totally and making it irrelevant to the
 
07:06:27.180 --> 07:06:28.310 align:start position:0%
totally and making it irrelevant to the
question

07:06:28.310 --> 07:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:06:31.190 --> 07:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't see that that's something to
 
07:06:33.410 --> 07:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
respond to at this point well if I may
 
07:06:35.090 --> 07:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
I'll continue on that same line on
 
07:06:37.310 --> 07:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
another on another line
 
07:06:39.770 --> 07:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
um if we go down just a few lines here
 
07:06:43.010 --> 07:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
to let's see
 
07:06:45.948 --> 07:06:45.958 align:start position:0%
line 11 the right to countenance and
 
07:06:47.330 --> 07:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
implication of the principles of
 
07:06:50.150 --> 07:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
humanity and general benevolence
 
07:06:55.430 --> 07:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
that seems less of a student right than
 
07:06:57.650 --> 07:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
a state power
 
07:07:00.788 --> 07:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
to inculcate in a student
 
07:07:03.830 --> 07:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
ideological values so taken together is
 
07:07:07.010 --> 07:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
that not actually taking those two items
 
07:07:10.310 --> 07:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
together is that not shifting the
 
07:07:12.410 --> 07:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
responsibility and right of a parent to
 
07:07:16.128 --> 07:07:16.138 align:start position:0%
direct the religious faith and values
 
07:07:18.230 --> 07:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
upbringing of their children to the to
 
07:07:20.230 --> 07:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
the government to the state you know
 
07:07:23.830 --> 07:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
none of this is is trying to supersede
 
07:07:26.330 --> 07:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
parental rights as I said in the
 
07:07:29.448 --> 07:07:29.458 align:start position:0%
beginning it's a way to numerate to
 
07:07:31.070 --> 07:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
focus on students
 
07:07:34.128 --> 07:07:34.138 align:start position:0%
and give them rights out of our
 
07:07:36.490 --> 07:07:36.500 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the U.S Constitution
 
07:07:41.030 --> 07:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
benevolence as as a definition means
 
07:07:43.190 --> 07:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
communication that conveys a sense of
 
07:07:45.708 --> 07:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
compassion or commiseration emanating
 
07:07:48.708 --> 07:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
from Humane impulses so benevolence
 
07:07:51.770 --> 07:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
means empathy and we hope that that
 
07:07:54.590 --> 07:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's one thing that that students will
 
07:07:59.810 --> 07:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:02.930 --> 07:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
and if I may just one one more quick one
 
07:08:04.968 --> 07:08:04.978 align:start position:0%
um I noticed again that this goes to a
 
07:08:07.490 --> 07:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
question uh rep McDonnell asked that the
 
07:08:09.170 --> 07:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
manner of selecting certain rights but
 
07:08:11.750 --> 07:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
leaving others out I didn't notice any
 
07:08:14.330 --> 07:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
references to the rights to obtaining
 
07:08:16.730 --> 07:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
seeking or enjoying property nor to
 
07:08:19.368 --> 07:08:19.378 align:start position:0%
enjoying or defending life or Liberty is
 
07:08:20.510 --> 07:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
there a reason that those were not
 
07:08:23.810 --> 07:08:23.820 align:start position:0%
included I believe I believe
 
07:08:25.788 --> 07:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
um well certainly you can check that out
 
07:08:28.850 --> 07:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
with um lawyers or other Law Services
 
07:08:31.070 --> 07:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
but I I believe that wouldn't be
 
07:08:33.948 --> 07:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
applicable to a lot of students because
 
07:08:35.510 --> 07:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the age
 
07:08:37.968 --> 07:08:37.978 align:start position:0%
thank you I got a question for you right
 
07:08:40.548 --> 07:08:40.558 align:start position:0%
here um I guess I'm questioning why
 
07:08:42.708 --> 07:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
we're even seeing this bill or why this
 
07:08:44.628 --> 07:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
bill is needed
 
07:08:47.390 --> 07:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
these are students who are residents of
 
07:08:49.730 --> 07:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
our country
 
07:08:52.910 --> 07:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
they have the same rights to the
 
07:08:56.030 --> 07:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
Constitutions of the United States and
 
07:08:58.610 --> 07:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
07:09:00.708 --> 07:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
as adults do
 
07:09:04.070 --> 07:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
so why are we trying to pick and choose
 
07:09:05.330 --> 07:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
some of these rights and throw in here
 
07:09:07.128 --> 07:09:07.138 align:start position:0%
when they already have these rights by
 
07:09:08.810 --> 07:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
way the Constitution and both
 
07:09:08.820 --> 07:09:10.730 align:start position:0%
way the Constitution and both
constitutions

07:09:10.730 --> 07:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
constitutions
 
07:09:12.948 --> 07:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh to bring the focus back on students
 
07:09:16.070 --> 07:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
we have as as I said we last year and
 
07:09:17.570 --> 07:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
this year we're hearing a parental Bill
 
07:09:20.030 --> 07:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
of Rights that enumerates
 
07:09:22.548 --> 07:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
the rights that are in this Constitution
 
07:09:25.850 --> 07:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
and also in statutes and and uh adds a
 
07:09:29.570 --> 07:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
few and this one simply says that
 
07:09:31.310 --> 07:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
students have rights as well
 
07:09:34.968 --> 07:09:34.978 align:start position:0%
and pick and choose well some rights are
 
07:09:40.190 --> 07:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
more applicable to minors and to um you
 
07:09:41.510 --> 07:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
know they don't have the same right of
 
07:09:44.690 --> 07:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
that that adults do uh and certainly not
 
07:09:47.390 --> 07:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
in school sometimes so
 
07:09:49.610 --> 07:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
07:09:49.620 --> 07:09:53.030 align:start position:0%
further questions
yes

07:09:53.030 --> 07:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:55.010 --> 07:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
07:09:58.548 --> 07:09:58.558 align:start position:0%
what's the fiscal note for
 
07:10:01.010 --> 07:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
the physical note I don't know they
 
07:10:02.690 --> 07:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
didn't put one
 
07:10:02.700 --> 07:10:05.150 align:start position:0%
didn't put one
yeah

07:10:05.150 --> 07:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:10:07.670 --> 07:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
yeah that's uh they said they didn't
 
07:10:10.610 --> 07:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
couldn't surprise I had no idea what
 
07:10:13.430 --> 07:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
they thought unless it was the part
 
07:10:13.440 --> 07:10:14.448 align:start position:0%
they thought unless it was the part
about

07:10:14.448 --> 07:10:14.458 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:10:18.590 --> 07:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
um that schools needed to uh post it
 
07:10:18.600 --> 07:10:19.310 align:start position:0%
um that schools needed to uh post it
um

07:10:19.310 --> 07:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:10:21.530 --> 07:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
you know that would that was one of the
 
07:10:23.690 --> 07:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
parts but that was in the part they cut
 
07:10:23.700 --> 07:10:24.530 align:start position:0%
parts but that was in the part they cut
out

07:10:24.530 --> 07:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
out
 
07:10:26.208 --> 07:10:26.218 align:start position:0%
when all of us
 
07:10:28.850 --> 07:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
did it they cut out that part but in the
 
07:10:31.250 --> 07:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
opening statement you know it has about
 
07:10:33.530 --> 07:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
that the schools should should display
 
07:10:36.170 --> 07:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
it and I think that's probably where it
 
07:10:37.548 --> 07:10:37.558 align:start position:0%
came from
 
07:10:39.230 --> 07:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
07:10:39.240 --> 07:10:41.150 align:start position:0%
for the questions
yes

07:10:41.150 --> 07:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:10:43.250 --> 07:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
forgive me if you said this already and
 
07:10:44.690 --> 07:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
I missed it but are there any other
 
07:10:46.910 --> 07:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
states that have enacted a student Bill
 
07:10:49.368 --> 07:10:49.378 align:start position:0%
of Rights I think there are a couple
 
07:10:49.378 --> 07:10:50.468 align:start position:0%
of Rights I think there are a couple
um

07:10:50.468 --> 07:10:50.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:10:54.350 --> 07:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
I was reading uh ncls uh and they were
 
07:10:56.390 --> 07:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
talking about some states that actually
 
07:10:59.570 --> 07:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
had started this project to try to
 
07:11:01.850 --> 07:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
enumerate the bill you know the student
 
07:11:05.930 --> 07:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:08.150 --> 07:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you thank
 
07:11:11.030 --> 07:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
you I just wanted to go back
 
07:11:14.208 --> 07:11:14.218 align:start position:0%
um if these are all existing
 
07:11:17.030 --> 07:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
um rights per the U.S or New Hampshire
 
07:11:20.330 --> 07:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh I'm still not sure why
 
07:11:23.090 --> 07:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
it's limited to just public school
 
07:11:25.788 --> 07:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
students who don't non-public school
 
07:11:27.890 --> 07:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
students and home school students have
 
07:11:30.170 --> 07:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
these same rights as well well I think
 
07:11:32.150 --> 07:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
just like the parental Bill of Rights
 
07:11:34.910 --> 07:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
only affect public schools and public
 
07:11:38.048 --> 07:11:38.058 align:start position:0%
school students and parents I certainly
 
07:11:41.270 --> 07:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know these rights are in the
 
07:11:43.670 --> 07:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution both the US and and New
 
07:11:46.448 --> 07:11:46.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constitutions and certainly
 
07:11:49.128 --> 07:11:49.138 align:start position:0%
apply like I said the purpose of this
 
07:11:52.070 --> 07:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
was not to add any new ones but simply
 
07:11:55.670 --> 07:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
simply to enumerate the ones that exist
 
07:11:58.610 --> 07:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
07:12:04.730 --> 07:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:15.350 --> 07:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:18.110 --> 07:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
let me see I'm going to hand this to
 
07:12:20.390 --> 07:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative dry if you're okay with
 
07:12:27.230 --> 07:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:27.240 --> 07:12:30.788 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:12:30.788 --> 07:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:33.770 --> 07:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
so in all honesty I was going to make a
 
07:12:35.868 --> 07:12:35.878 align:start position:0%
joke about coming in today to check on
 
07:12:37.910 --> 07:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
my representative that I was doing a
 
07:12:41.150 --> 07:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
wellness check to make sure that at 4 15
 
07:12:43.850 --> 07:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
on a Friday afternoon she was handling
 
07:12:46.128 --> 07:12:46.138 align:start position:0%
things okay but she looks good so I'll
 
07:12:48.890 --> 07:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
just uh I'll just proceed thank you uh
 
07:12:51.890 --> 07:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and chair people for having me
 
07:12:51.900 --> 07:12:53.570 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and chair people for having me
today

07:12:53.570 --> 07:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:12:56.270 --> 07:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
um I have often heard members of House
 
07:12:56.280 --> 07:12:57.708 align:start position:0%
um I have often heard members of House
Education

07:12:57.708 --> 07:12:57.718 align:start position:0%
Education
 
07:13:00.590 --> 07:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
reference the fact that somebody needs
 
07:13:03.650 --> 07:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
to continuously advocate for the kids
 
07:13:06.110 --> 07:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
when we consider changes to New
 
07:13:08.628 --> 07:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law we'd be that additions or
 
07:13:12.170 --> 07:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
deletions and today is no exception
 
07:13:14.930 --> 07:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 629 the student Bill of
 
07:13:17.208 --> 07:13:17.218 align:start position:0%
Rights looks to me to be centered around
 
07:13:19.968 --> 07:13:19.978 align:start position:0%
the concept that children have the same
 
07:13:22.910 --> 07:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
right to respect and autonomy as the
 
07:13:24.230 --> 07:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
rest of us
 
07:13:27.048 --> 07:13:27.058 align:start position:0%
it reminds us that both the federal and
 
07:13:29.810 --> 07:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
state constitutions as well as the
 
07:13:32.810 --> 07:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
corresponding statutes seek to defend an
 
07:13:35.990 --> 07:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
individual's rights to formulate
 
07:13:38.868 --> 07:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
and act upon their thoughts and beliefs
 
07:13:41.628 --> 07:13:41.638 align:start position:0%
without fear of reprisal
 
07:13:44.330 --> 07:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
it protects the vulnerable and reaffirms
 
07:13:46.968 --> 07:13:46.978 align:start position:0%
public schools as a Cornerstone of the
 
07:13:49.788 --> 07:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
foundation upon which Live Free or Die
 
07:13:52.968 --> 07:13:52.978 align:start position:0%
proudly stands
 
07:13:56.990 --> 07:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
again HB 629 appears to me to be The
 
07:13:59.090 --> 07:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
Offspring of principles that have stood
 
07:14:01.310 --> 07:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
the test of time
 
07:14:03.530 --> 07:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
all people have the right to pursue
 
07:14:06.650 --> 07:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
happiness yes representative I did say
 
07:14:06.660 --> 07:14:08.530 align:start position:0%
happiness yes representative I did say
pursue

07:14:08.530 --> 07:14:08.540 align:start position:0%
pursue
 
07:14:11.330 --> 07:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
the essential freedoms of speech
 
07:14:14.090 --> 07:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
petition the Press peaceful assembly
 
07:14:17.030 --> 07:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
privacy conscience and representation
 
07:14:19.368 --> 07:14:19.378 align:start position:0%
are to be cherished
 
07:14:22.368 --> 07:14:22.378 align:start position:0%
modeling benevolence is a worthy and
 
07:14:25.250 --> 07:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
shared Duty that speaks to the best in
 
07:14:25.260 --> 07:14:26.628 align:start position:0%
shared Duty that speaks to the best in
US

07:14:26.628 --> 07:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
US
 
07:14:29.628 --> 07:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
we are all created equally and deserve
 
07:14:32.390 --> 07:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
to exercise our commitment towards being
 
07:14:34.430 --> 07:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
contributing members of our communities
 
07:14:37.430 --> 07:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
without judgment
 
07:14:40.910 --> 07:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
HB 629 points out that the fact that
 
07:14:43.968 --> 07:14:43.978 align:start position:0%
these rights extend to minors as well as
 
07:14:45.468 --> 07:14:45.478 align:start position:0%
to adults
 
07:14:48.110 --> 07:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
it does not attempt to create an
 
07:14:50.810 --> 07:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list of Rights but rather
 
07:14:52.910 --> 07:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
appears to frame some of the core
 
07:14:55.730 --> 07:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
principles that such a list might be
 
07:14:57.890 --> 07:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
based upon
 
07:15:00.288 --> 07:15:00.298 align:start position:0%
advocating for student rights requires
 
07:15:02.090 --> 07:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
an understanding of the importance of
 
07:15:02.100 --> 07:15:03.590 align:start position:0%
an understanding of the importance of
relationships

07:15:03.590 --> 07:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
07:15:06.830 --> 07:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
it highlights trust and the necessity
 
07:15:09.590 --> 07:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
for authentic communication
 
07:15:12.048 --> 07:15:12.058 align:start position:0%
reading this bill I was reminded of the
 
07:15:14.750 --> 07:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
countless times I was grateful for the
 
07:15:17.750 --> 07:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities my own children had to
 
07:15:17.760 --> 07:15:19.190 align:start position:0%
opportunities my own children had to
question

07:15:19.190 --> 07:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:15:23.150 --> 07:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
to learn to evaluate and adopt their own
 
07:15:25.910 --> 07:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
standards and project their own values
 
07:15:28.368 --> 07:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
into the world as it is
 
07:15:31.190 --> 07:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
even as we all struggled as parents of
 
07:15:33.650 --> 07:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
adolescents to get through it
 
07:15:36.708 --> 07:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support 629 as a safeguard
 
07:15:39.830 --> 07:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
to the ideals that we all hold dear
 
07:15:43.070 --> 07:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
in our imperfect Union it stands as a
 
07:15:45.048 --> 07:15:45.058 align:start position:0%
statement of support for New Hampshire's
 
07:15:47.150 --> 07:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
children thank you
 
07:15:49.190 --> 07:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other questions for
 
07:15:51.708 --> 07:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
our honorable moments
 
07:15:53.510 --> 07:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon
 
07:15:56.330 --> 07:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
um I was just curious as to
 
07:15:58.610 --> 07:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
um what you meant by students have the
 
07:16:02.510 --> 07:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
right to autonomy when I told my kids to
 
07:16:04.610 --> 07:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
do their homework or go to bed I'm not
 
07:16:06.530 --> 07:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
sure how much autonomy I was really
 
07:16:09.650 --> 07:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
giving them uh
 
07:16:09.660 --> 07:16:10.968 align:start position:0%
giving them uh
companion

07:16:10.968 --> 07:16:10.978 align:start position:0%
companion
 
07:16:13.430 --> 07:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative to court cordelli to you
 
07:16:15.590 --> 07:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
don't always have to say what you think
 
07:16:19.910 --> 07:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
I I when I meant when I said autonomy I
 
07:16:22.310 --> 07:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
did not mean uh Independence and all
 
07:16:25.670 --> 07:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
decision making but rather
 
07:16:27.770 --> 07:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
that kids have a right to have their own
 
07:16:30.948 --> 07:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
thoughts and feelings without judgment
 
07:16:34.788 --> 07:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:36.468 --> 07:16:36.478 align:start position:0%
reps in the god
 
07:16:38.510 --> 07:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
07:16:42.048 --> 07:16:42.058 align:start position:0%
your testimony on this in
 
07:16:44.628 --> 07:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
in addition to representative cordelli's
 
07:16:46.128 --> 07:16:46.138 align:start position:0%
comment that some lines could be
 
07:16:48.110 --> 07:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
misconstrued by students who are
 
07:16:50.930 --> 07:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
children such as the autonomy measure
 
07:16:53.930 --> 07:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
would you agree that it might be better
 
07:16:57.468 --> 07:16:57.478 align:start position:0%
to teach students about their civic
 
07:17:00.410 --> 07:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
rights and their rights as people in
 
07:17:02.448 --> 07:17:02.458 align:start position:0%
this country within the state and maybe
 
07:17:04.610 --> 07:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
a civics class or Civics instruction
 
07:17:06.350 --> 07:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
within school that might be the better
 
07:17:08.690 --> 07:17:08.700 align:start position:0%
place for something like this I'm sure
 
07:17:09.948 --> 07:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
you probably already know this because
 
07:17:11.330 --> 07:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
you've experienced it yourself
 
07:17:13.490 --> 07:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative but that is already a
 
07:17:15.350 --> 07:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
requirement in New Hampshire that
 
07:17:18.110 --> 07:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
students must study Civics yes do you
 
07:17:19.968 --> 07:17:19.978 align:start position:0%
think that that should be expanded it's
 
07:17:21.770 --> 07:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
not required that it's a specific course
 
07:17:23.810 --> 07:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
as it is during the course required
 
07:17:25.730 --> 07:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
maybe as a graduation requirement you
 
07:17:27.350 --> 07:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
know I would have to see the specifics
 
07:17:29.448 --> 07:17:29.458 align:start position:0%
of that before I commented on it but I
 
07:17:31.670 --> 07:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
certainly believe that Civics education
 
07:17:33.708 --> 07:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
ought to be embedded in everything that
 
07:17:34.548 --> 07:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
we do
 
07:17:36.170 --> 07:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:17:37.850 --> 07:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
07:17:39.468 --> 07:17:39.478 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
07:17:41.030 --> 07:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
07:17:43.128 --> 07:17:43.138 align:start position:0%
testimony I just wanted to ask are you
 
07:17:45.590 --> 07:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
are you aware generally that there's a a
 
07:17:47.868 --> 07:17:47.878 align:start position:0%
Litany of Supreme Court precedent on a
 
07:17:49.548 --> 07:17:49.558 align:start position:0%
number of items that are on here that
 
07:17:52.070 --> 07:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
would seem to directly go against
 
07:17:53.448 --> 07:17:53.458 align:start position:0%
a number of the items that are on here
 
07:17:56.030 --> 07:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
if I was they probably would not be in
 
07:17:58.548 --> 07:17:58.558 align:start position:0%
front of you right now okay if I'm not
 
07:18:00.948 --> 07:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
just just to offer an example to get a
 
07:18:03.048 --> 07:18:03.058 align:start position:0%
specific on for instance the right to
 
07:18:05.270 --> 07:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
peaceably assemble the Supreme Court has
 
07:18:07.368 --> 07:18:07.378 align:start position:0%
ruled that children do not essentially
 
07:18:09.048 --> 07:18:09.058 align:start position:0%
have right to peaceably assemble
 
07:18:11.270 --> 07:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
Outdoors during chemistry
 
07:18:11.280 --> 07:18:13.150 align:start position:0%
Outdoors during chemistry
it's

07:18:13.150 --> 07:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
it's
 
07:18:15.948 --> 07:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
they have more limitations on them than
 
07:18:17.750 --> 07:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
adults do and this has been repeatedly
 
07:18:19.430 --> 07:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
upheld they don't have the right to
 
07:18:20.750 --> 07:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
publish anything they want through the
 
07:18:22.670 --> 07:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
school newspaper
 
07:18:22.680 --> 07:18:23.770 align:start position:0%
school newspaper
um

07:18:23.770 --> 07:18:23.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:18:26.270 --> 07:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
is that can I respond to the
 
07:18:26.280 --> 07:18:27.350 align:start position:0%
is that can I respond to the
representative

07:18:27.350 --> 07:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:18:31.490 --> 07:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
um are you indicating to me that context
 
07:18:36.770 --> 07:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:38.690 --> 07:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
um I mean you said they don't have the
 
07:18:40.190 --> 07:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
right to be supportive they don't have
 
07:18:42.170 --> 07:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
the right to peaceably assemble during
 
07:18:44.750 --> 07:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
chemistry class or whatever that's a
 
07:18:47.750 --> 07:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
context yes that it doesn't mean that
 
07:18:49.010 --> 07:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
children don't have the right to
 
07:18:51.110 --> 07:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
peaceably assemble it means that there
 
07:18:53.690 --> 07:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
may be parameters around appropriate
 
07:18:55.968 --> 07:18:55.978 align:start position:0%
time and places that what you're
 
07:18:58.968 --> 07:18:58.978 align:start position:0%
intimating I was I was merely suggesting
 
07:19:01.070 --> 07:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
that compared to adult rights there is
 
07:19:03.288 --> 07:19:03.298 align:start position:0%
more limitations placed on children's
 
07:19:05.930 --> 07:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
rights and especially in the context of
 
07:19:09.288 --> 07:19:09.298 align:start position:0%
being in in a school environment
 
07:19:12.048 --> 07:19:12.058 align:start position:0%
um right I don't think anything I don't
 
07:19:15.410 --> 07:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
think anything in this bill uh supposes
 
07:19:18.110 --> 07:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
that orderliness of a school would be in
 
07:19:21.350 --> 07:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
violation with with the rights of their
 
07:19:23.150 --> 07:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
students thank you
 
07:19:24.890 --> 07:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
07:19:27.670 --> 07:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
I got one for you sure um
 
07:19:30.650 --> 07:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
obviously this is about our children in
 
07:19:33.468 --> 07:19:33.478 align:start position:0%
schools has there been any thought to
 
07:19:35.990 --> 07:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
try to involve the process we have in
 
07:19:38.270 --> 07:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
place right now uh the student
 
07:19:38.280 --> 07:19:39.368 align:start position:0%
place right now uh the student
legislative

07:19:39.368 --> 07:19:39.378 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
07:19:42.410 --> 07:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
advisory Council which we have we have a
 
07:19:46.010 --> 07:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
group uh is it possible that you know by
 
07:19:47.330 --> 07:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
ramming something like this through
 
07:19:50.868 --> 07:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
without seeking that input and
 
07:19:54.288 --> 07:19:54.298 align:start position:0%
help from the students themselves maybe
 
07:19:56.330 --> 07:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
we're missing a real learning
 
07:19:58.070 --> 07:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity here
 
07:20:00.110 --> 07:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with you on that
 
07:20:00.120 --> 07:20:01.368 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with you on that
representative

07:20:01.368 --> 07:20:01.378 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:20:03.948 --> 07:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
um I don't know whether or not lyak has
 
07:20:06.770 --> 07:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
identified one of these bills
 
07:20:06.780 --> 07:20:07.968 align:start position:0%
identified one of these bills
um

07:20:07.968 --> 07:20:07.978 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:20:09.708 --> 07:20:09.718 align:start position:0%
but I certainly think that they would
 
07:20:12.288 --> 07:20:12.298 align:start position:0%
have valid input thank you further
 
07:20:12.298 --> 07:20:13.730 align:start position:0%
have valid input thank you further
questions

07:20:13.730 --> 07:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:20:15.468 --> 07:20:15.478 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome have
 
07:20:17.150 --> 07:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
a good weekend
 
07:20:28.208 --> 07:20:28.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:30.770 --> 07:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
Mr chair committee members Aubrey
 
07:20:33.650 --> 07:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
Friedman Bridgewater well this is an odd
 
07:20:33.660 --> 07:20:34.730 align:start position:0%
Friedman Bridgewater well this is an odd
one

07:20:34.730 --> 07:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
one
 
07:20:37.310 --> 07:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to oppose it but it has
 
07:20:39.170 --> 07:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
actually some some good things in it
 
07:20:41.390 --> 07:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
that I really like
 
07:20:43.850 --> 07:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
um I think if they had just stuck to the
 
07:20:46.670 --> 07:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
things that were in the Constitution
 
07:20:49.430 --> 07:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
which I went through and you know
 
07:20:51.530 --> 07:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
article two and that is right that one
 
07:20:54.830 --> 07:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
about obtain happiness I said how can
 
07:20:56.510 --> 07:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
that be and it really is in the New
 
07:20:59.750 --> 07:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution that's incredible
 
07:21:03.890 --> 07:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
but it is so in general is pretty good
 
07:21:07.070 --> 07:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me they've added a
 
07:21:09.048 --> 07:21:09.058 align:start position:0%
couple things in here that are
 
07:21:12.170 --> 07:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
problematic that uh to me look like
 
07:21:16.310 --> 07:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
going into entitlements for example uh
 
07:21:18.530 --> 07:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
if you look under section two there's a
 
07:21:20.770 --> 07:21:20.780 align:start position:0%
couple here section two
 
07:21:24.468 --> 07:21:24.478 align:start position:0%
uh let's see a the right so the right of
 
07:21:24.478 --> 07:21:25.548 align:start position:0%
uh let's see a the right so the right of
students

07:21:25.548 --> 07:21:25.558 align:start position:0%
students
 
07:21:27.890 --> 07:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
and these are especially which Patriots
 
07:21:31.128 --> 07:21:31.138 align:start position:0%
oh well sorry I printed it out
 
07:21:34.310 --> 07:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
differently so for me too but so it
 
07:21:35.868 --> 07:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
might not match your lines but it's
 
07:21:38.628 --> 07:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
under section two
 
07:21:40.368 --> 07:21:40.378 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple there's about five
 
07:21:43.190 --> 07:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
places in here to me these involve money
 
07:21:45.770 --> 07:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
and so I'm wondering and also because
 
07:21:48.410 --> 07:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
there's not a fiscal note I wonder if
 
07:21:51.230 --> 07:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
these kind of things became law would
 
07:21:54.250 --> 07:21:54.260 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers be on the hook for
 
07:21:57.890 --> 07:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
providing more services for example and
 
07:21:59.390 --> 07:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
they're kind of vague too so this is
 
07:22:02.150 --> 07:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
under Section 2A it's a right mind you
 
07:22:05.750 --> 07:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
free and appropriate education
 
07:22:08.030 --> 07:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
free and appropriate that's a little we
 
07:22:10.128 --> 07:22:10.138 align:start position:0%
already know about adequate education or
 
07:22:12.708 --> 07:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
the Claremont decision 20 years ago so
 
07:22:15.468 --> 07:22:15.478 align:start position:0%
that's a little problem here then look
 
07:22:19.368 --> 07:22:19.378 align:start position:0%
at c section 2C again it's a right uh
 
07:22:22.670 --> 07:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
and then it's offered by a recipient a
 
07:22:25.190 --> 07:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
federal financial assistance so we're
 
07:22:27.468 --> 07:22:27.478 align:start position:0%
getting into money areas here and these
 
07:22:29.868 --> 07:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
are not in the Constitution so there's
 
07:22:32.448 --> 07:22:32.458 align:start position:0%
there's about five of them here the
 
07:22:36.350 --> 07:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
weirdest one of all uh okay okay now in
 
07:22:38.628 --> 07:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
section three
 
07:22:40.548 --> 07:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
um the right to attend public school
 
07:22:43.548 --> 07:22:43.558 align:start position:0%
excuse me three F the right to attend
 
07:22:46.670 --> 07:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
public schools that are funded that is
 
07:22:49.868 --> 07:22:49.878 align:start position:0%
consistent and then they say ample so
 
07:22:54.048 --> 07:22:54.058 align:start position:0%
this is getting Beyond you know Civics
 
07:22:55.730 --> 07:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
type of things
 
07:22:58.548 --> 07:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
um the and I'm worried that this you
 
07:23:00.530 --> 07:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
know if you hit the financial note and
 
07:23:02.270 --> 07:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
all that and they oh we actually have to
 
07:23:05.330 --> 07:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
give more money so and the weirdest one
 
07:23:09.410 --> 07:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
of all look at this one section three
 
07:23:13.788 --> 07:23:13.798 align:start position:0%
G I read this about 10 times does it
 
07:23:15.590 --> 07:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
what look at the wording on here the
 
07:23:17.270 --> 07:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
right to have schools that are
 
07:23:20.150 --> 07:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
maintained holy or partially by public
 
07:23:23.868 --> 07:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
funds free from sectarian control or
 
07:23:23.878 --> 07:23:25.490 align:start position:0%
funds free from sectarian control or
influence

07:23:25.490 --> 07:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
influence
 
07:23:28.968 --> 07:23:28.978 align:start position:0%
that the words maintain holy or
 
07:23:32.150 --> 07:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
partially by public funds that's
 
07:23:35.090 --> 07:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
disturbing why not just say just take
 
07:23:36.770 --> 07:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
out those words and just say the right
 
07:23:39.468 --> 07:23:39.478 align:start position:0%
to have schools that are free from
 
07:23:42.708 --> 07:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
sectarian uh sectarian control or
 
07:23:44.330 --> 07:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
influence in other words to have schools
 
07:23:46.548 --> 07:23:46.558 align:start position:0%
you know so there are schools that are
 
07:23:48.708 --> 07:23:48.718 align:start position:0%
not religious schools to have the option
 
07:23:50.930 --> 07:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
that's reasonable why would they put
 
07:23:53.628 --> 07:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
that in there that's it to me looks like
 
07:23:57.890 --> 07:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
infringing on maybe any uh anybody that
 
07:24:00.468 --> 07:24:00.478 align:start position:0%
takes public funds maybe an independent
 
07:24:03.948 --> 07:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
school or efas or who knows it's that's
 
07:24:03.958 --> 07:24:05.990 align:start position:0%
school or efas or who knows it's that's
weird

07:24:05.990 --> 07:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
weird
 
07:24:10.968 --> 07:24:10.978 align:start position:0%
um then this is section four a again
 
07:24:13.310 --> 07:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
right it's a right to access without
 
07:24:15.730 --> 07:24:15.740 align:start position:0%
tuition so
 
07:24:18.770 --> 07:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
these mentions of tuition and money and
 
07:24:22.190 --> 07:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
funding is concerning to me that we're
 
07:24:24.288 --> 07:24:24.298 align:start position:0%
going we're going into entitlements now
 
07:24:27.350 --> 07:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
and has been brought up before
 
07:24:29.868 --> 07:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
what problem is this bill trying to
 
07:24:29.878 --> 07:24:31.190 align:start position:0%
what problem is this bill trying to
solve

07:24:31.190 --> 07:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
solve
 
07:24:32.930 --> 07:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
um and what proof is there that this
 
07:24:34.610 --> 07:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
bill will actually solve a problem and
 
07:24:36.468 --> 07:24:36.478 align:start position:0%
was as was mentioned
 
07:24:38.930 --> 07:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
maybe should be taught
 
07:24:41.690 --> 07:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
um when I was growing up we had in
 
07:24:43.368 --> 07:24:43.378 align:start position:0%
eighth grade I believe it was the
 
07:24:46.368 --> 07:24:46.378 align:start position:0%
Constitution and it was a big project
 
07:24:48.230 --> 07:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
everybody knew when you got to eighth
 
07:24:51.230 --> 07:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
grade so that would be the time to
 
07:24:55.490 --> 07:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
really get into these issues and it I
 
07:24:57.288 --> 07:24:57.298 align:start position:0%
think they're not doing it these days to
 
07:24:59.570 --> 07:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
be honest so that would be rather than
 
07:25:02.570 --> 07:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
passing a law with a vague language and
 
07:25:02.580 --> 07:25:04.010 align:start position:0%
passing a law with a vague language and
stuff

07:25:04.010 --> 07:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
07:25:08.090 --> 07:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
um and then my last thought uh oh and by
 
07:25:10.010 --> 07:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
the way why it only mentioned Public
 
07:25:12.788 --> 07:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
Schools that's problematic too that's
 
07:25:15.110 --> 07:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
discriminatory kids who don't go to
 
07:25:16.548 --> 07:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
public schools they don't have the
 
07:25:20.690 --> 07:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
rights so that's really was a a boo-boo
 
07:25:22.788 --> 07:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
there as far as I'm concerned but my
 
07:25:24.468 --> 07:25:24.478 align:start position:0%
last thought on this so
 
07:25:27.350 --> 07:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
student Bill of Rights I grew up you
 
07:25:29.390 --> 07:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
just went to school with that and we
 
07:25:31.190 --> 07:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
didn't have rights you're a student
 
07:25:32.990 --> 07:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're a minor and that's the end of
 
07:25:36.890 --> 07:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
then my son I'm a parent now I mean he's
 
07:25:38.570 --> 07:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
grown now but it was the same thing you
 
07:25:41.030 --> 07:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the same rights as adults so
 
07:25:43.208 --> 07:25:43.218 align:start position:0%
but now it's a different day and time
 
07:25:46.128 --> 07:25:46.138 align:start position:0%
student what is it so let me do a little
 
07:25:47.990 --> 07:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
research because this bill interested me
 
07:25:50.510 --> 07:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
and I went online to look and I actually
 
07:25:52.910 --> 07:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
found one and I I'll pass it around as
 
07:25:55.430 --> 07:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
the uh my backup here and it's actually
 
07:25:57.650 --> 07:25:57.660 align:start position:0%
from the National Youth Rights
 
07:26:01.968 --> 07:26:01.978 align:start position:0%
Association and it's uh six pages is
 
07:26:04.548 --> 07:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
pretty good of course I don't agree with
 
07:26:07.850 --> 07:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
everything in here but that's a real The
 
07:26:09.830 --> 07:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
Real McCoy talking about students like
 
07:26:12.110 --> 07:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
you're really people and I mean it
 
07:26:13.670 --> 07:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
includes some things that parents would
 
07:26:16.730 --> 07:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
freak out for example uh the right well
 
07:26:18.288 --> 07:26:18.298 align:start position:0%
some of them are okay I really agree
 
07:26:20.090 --> 07:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
with most of it the right to view your
 
07:26:22.250 --> 07:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
own school records I don't think the
 
07:26:24.590 --> 07:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
right the right to refuse assistance
 
07:26:28.070 --> 07:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
schools where do you hear that then at
 
07:26:31.310 --> 07:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
school policies like zero and tolerance
 
07:26:33.948 --> 07:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
and then find another one right to
 
07:26:36.948 --> 07:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
refuse education citing the 13th
 
07:26:40.610 --> 07:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
Amendment as involuntary servitude so
 
07:26:43.010 --> 07:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
that's quite uh there's quite a bit
 
07:26:45.468 --> 07:26:45.478 align:start position:0%
there it's pretty good I mean there was
 
07:26:47.810 --> 07:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
one thing in here about like the budget
 
07:26:49.968 --> 07:26:49.978 align:start position:0%
that they get to vote on the budget no
 
07:26:51.590 --> 07:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
you don't get to vote on the budget if
 
07:26:53.750 --> 07:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
you're not paying for it sorry kids you
 
07:26:56.208 --> 07:26:56.218 align:start position:0%
don't but it's pretty good so when it
 
07:26:58.610 --> 07:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
comes around maybe you'll take that is a
 
07:27:01.070 --> 07:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
real student I mean it's too much but
 
07:27:03.110 --> 07:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of thing that's pretty
 
07:27:04.930 --> 07:27:04.940 align:start position:0%
good would bring up a lot of discussion
 
07:27:08.868 --> 07:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
and you know that'd be uh pretty good
 
07:27:11.150 --> 07:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
but I I really think this bill as it is
 
07:27:15.590 --> 07:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
is not needed and uh brings up some
 
07:27:18.170 --> 07:27:18.180 align:start position:0%
issues maybe with financing I think
 
07:27:20.090 --> 07:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
we're spending like plenty of money on
 
07:27:22.670 --> 07:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
the school so we I don't have to force
 
07:27:24.830 --> 07:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
anymore and
 
07:27:27.230 --> 07:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
I think that's it yeah thank you thank
 
07:27:29.930 --> 07:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
you very much are there questions yes
 
07:27:31.968 --> 07:27:31.978 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
07:27:33.230 --> 07:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I
 
07:27:34.670 --> 07:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you brought up the money
 
07:27:35.990 --> 07:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
side of things because that caught my
 
07:27:37.250 --> 07:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
eye a little bit too and I wanted to ask
 
07:27:40.250 --> 07:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
you if you were to look at uh Article 2
 
07:27:42.530 --> 07:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
here section A it says the right of
 
07:27:44.030 --> 07:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
students with identified disabilities to
 
07:27:45.530 --> 07:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
receive a free appropriate education
 
07:27:48.048 --> 07:27:48.058 align:start position:0%
that addresses their individual needs do
 
07:27:49.368 --> 07:27:49.378 align:start position:0%
you see anything in there that would
 
07:27:53.270 --> 07:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
identify what disabilities or what
 
07:27:55.430 --> 07:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
schooling this is limited to is this do
 
07:27:56.570 --> 07:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
you think this might include college
 
07:28:01.128 --> 07:28:01.138 align:start position:0%
grad school I mean I yeah well it's true
 
07:28:04.490 --> 07:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
I mean what is it any child enrolled in
 
07:28:07.310 --> 07:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire public or or chartered
 
07:28:09.530 --> 07:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
school and now since they're getting up
 
07:28:12.350 --> 07:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
to age 22 in in a public schools and
 
07:28:14.590 --> 07:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
stuff it really could
 
07:28:17.868 --> 07:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
and so I don't know I
 
07:28:20.270 --> 07:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
this is a can of worms as far as I'm
 
07:28:23.628 --> 07:28:23.638 align:start position:0%
concerned and I don't think it's a good
 
07:28:23.638 --> 07:28:25.010 align:start position:0%
concerned and I don't think it's a good
idea

07:28:25.010 --> 07:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
idea
 
07:28:26.770 --> 07:28:26.780 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
07:28:30.230 --> 07:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
reps and whitcock thank you
 
07:28:32.830 --> 07:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me here um
 
07:28:35.270 --> 07:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the thank you for identifying
 
07:28:37.850 --> 07:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
those sections in in item two I I
 
07:28:39.708 --> 07:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
clearly don't agree with you for most of
 
07:28:41.930 --> 07:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
that but I would ask you on C that
 
07:28:43.910 --> 07:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the the free from
 
07:28:43.920 --> 07:28:45.948 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the the free from
discrimination

07:28:45.948 --> 07:28:45.958 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
07:28:48.048 --> 07:28:48.058 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that says the people
 
07:28:50.810 --> 07:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
who receive any financial assistance uh
 
07:28:52.610 --> 07:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to access education
 
07:28:55.070 --> 07:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
without being discriminated against
 
07:28:57.468 --> 07:28:57.478 align:start position:0%
did you read that differently well I
 
07:28:58.610 --> 07:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
think we should discriminate free from
 
07:29:00.650 --> 07:29:00.660 align:start position:0%
discrimination I'm okay with that part
 
07:29:02.810 --> 07:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
07:29:05.948 --> 07:29:05.958 align:start position:0%
when they get into recipient and federal
 
07:29:08.628 --> 07:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
financial assistance I'm either getting
 
07:29:10.610 --> 07:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
some type of Aid so it's freaking
 
07:29:10.620 --> 07:29:12.170 align:start position:0%
some type of Aid so it's freaking
survive

07:29:12.170 --> 07:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
survive
 
07:29:13.730 --> 07:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
could be food stamps could be anything
 
07:29:13.740 --> 07:29:17.390 align:start position:0%
could be food stamps could be anything
housing

07:29:17.390 --> 07:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:19.670 --> 07:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
um well I really don't like free
 
07:29:21.110 --> 07:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
programs from the federal government
 
07:29:23.208 --> 07:29:23.218 align:start position:0%
okay but that's fine that's the answer
 
07:29:26.170 --> 07:29:26.180 align:start position:0%
but thank you further questions
 
07:29:28.610 --> 07:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
07:29:30.410 --> 07:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
testimony once again it's good to have
 
07:29:31.430 --> 07:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
you back
 
07:29:34.430 --> 07:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
do you see within this bill a
 
07:29:37.730 --> 07:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
stipulation or a practice in place to
 
07:29:39.948 --> 07:29:39.958 align:start position:0%
talk to students who might misconstrue
 
07:29:43.310 --> 07:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
this and say maybe oh my tuition should
 
07:29:45.410 --> 07:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
be paid for or I should be able to
 
07:29:47.390 --> 07:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
peaceably assemble it to get out of
 
07:29:50.150 --> 07:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
class what's the method in place to tell
 
07:29:51.530 --> 07:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
those students that's not how this
 
07:29:54.468 --> 07:29:54.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:55.910 --> 07:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
well that's a problem when you start
 
07:29:58.628 --> 07:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
with a student Bill of Rights you know
 
07:30:02.030 --> 07:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's kind of oh wow I have I didn't know
 
07:30:04.430 --> 07:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
I had these I better exercise them or
 
07:30:07.490 --> 07:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
especially that obtain happiness and
 
07:30:08.750 --> 07:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
which is in the New Hampshire
 
07:30:12.548 --> 07:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
Constitution so I actually think
 
07:30:15.590 --> 07:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
students should be aware of these rights
 
07:30:17.810 --> 07:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
absolutely because when they become an
 
07:30:21.110 --> 07:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
adult they really will get them but as a
 
07:30:23.330 --> 07:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
student they kind of get them but I
 
07:30:27.288 --> 07:30:27.298 align:start position:0%
think yeah it could uh could create an
 
07:30:30.708 --> 07:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
illusion of oh wow we're like an adult
 
07:30:33.110 --> 07:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
now we can we can do all these things so
 
07:30:34.788 --> 07:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
it could be a problem
 
07:30:38.208 --> 07:30:38.218 align:start position:0%
yes so by that cause you would say this
 
07:30:40.910 --> 07:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill as is is lacking a protocol and
 
07:30:43.310 --> 07:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
could create disillusionment in students
 
07:30:46.670 --> 07:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
as is good it could yeah I think and
 
07:30:46.680 --> 07:30:48.230 align:start position:0%
as is good it could yeah I think and
yeah

07:30:48.230 --> 07:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:30:48.240 --> 07:30:49.190 align:start position:0%
yeah
foreign

07:30:49.190 --> 07:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:30:49.200 --> 07:30:50.990 align:start position:0%
foreign
questions

07:30:50.990 --> 07:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:30:53.208 --> 07:30:53.218 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:30:56.810 --> 07:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:02.030 --> 07:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:03.708 --> 07:31:03.718 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be very very quick
 
07:31:05.030 --> 07:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
07:31:06.948 --> 07:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
committee man thank you
 
07:31:10.010 --> 07:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
um so just a couple of points on here it
 
07:31:12.650 --> 07:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
says pre-exercise of religion and I am
 
07:31:15.230 --> 07:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
taking no position on this okay I see a
 
07:31:16.788 --> 07:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
lot of good in it I see a lot of
 
07:31:19.910 --> 07:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity but I know the way kids work
 
07:31:23.390 --> 07:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
okay and the bottom line is when you say
 
07:31:26.570 --> 07:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
you have your you have the free choice
 
07:31:30.530 --> 07:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
to exercise your religion we're going to
 
07:31:30.540 --> 07:31:32.230 align:start position:0%
to exercise your religion we're going to
see

07:31:32.230 --> 07:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
see
 
07:31:36.048 --> 07:31:36.058 align:start position:0%
wwjd t-shirts we're going to see satanic
 
07:31:38.208 --> 07:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
t-shirts we're going to see because
 
07:31:41.090 --> 07:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
Satanism is a form of religion it's a
 
07:31:43.368 --> 07:31:43.378 align:start position:0%
recognized form of religion uh we're
 
07:31:46.548 --> 07:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
going to see you know who knows what and
 
07:31:48.170 --> 07:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a problem
 
07:31:50.890 --> 07:31:50.900 align:start position:0%
because we've already we've already
 
07:31:54.048 --> 07:31:54.058 align:start position:0%
found problems in our school through
 
07:31:57.468 --> 07:31:57.478 align:start position:0%
litigation where people have worn
 
07:32:01.070 --> 07:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
um proudly warn their position on
 
07:32:05.270 --> 07:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
religion or a political candidate or
 
07:32:07.910 --> 07:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
whatever and it has become a problem so
 
07:32:10.670 --> 07:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
there I see it the other one I think is
 
07:32:14.270 --> 07:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
beautifully expressed and how what a
 
07:32:16.548 --> 07:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
slippery slope this could be is freedom
 
07:32:18.048 --> 07:32:18.058 align:start position:0%
of speech
 
07:32:21.770 --> 07:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
you're in a classroom and you decide
 
07:32:24.170 --> 07:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
that you don't like what's going on or
 
07:32:25.910 --> 07:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's a test and everyone's supposed to
 
07:32:28.070 --> 07:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
be quiet I'm exercising my freedom of
 
07:32:28.080 --> 07:32:29.270 align:start position:0%
be quiet I'm exercising my freedom of
speech

07:32:29.270 --> 07:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
speech
 
07:32:31.070 --> 07:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter whether it's appropriate
 
07:32:33.530 --> 07:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
or not I'm exercising it it says right
 
07:32:36.350 --> 07:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
here in my Bill of Rights
 
07:32:38.330 --> 07:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
slippery slope especially when we're
 
07:32:39.830 --> 07:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with children who have not
 
07:32:42.788 --> 07:32:42.798 align:start position:0%
developed the full sense of of
 
07:32:46.430 --> 07:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
consequences for choices made
 
07:32:51.110 --> 07:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
um I chose to look up if we had any
 
07:32:51.120 --> 07:32:51.948 align:start position:0%
um I chose to look up if we had any
um

07:32:51.948 --> 07:32:51.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:54.288 --> 07:32:54.298 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights for students here in our
 
07:32:57.590 --> 07:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
country what I got is a quote no country
 
07:33:00.830 --> 07:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
in North America has yet to adopt a
 
07:33:03.770 --> 07:33:03.780 align:start position:0%
national student Bill of Rights
 
07:33:07.190 --> 07:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's a good reason for that most likely
 
07:33:09.708 --> 07:33:09.718 align:start position:0%
um interestingly enough
 
07:33:13.548 --> 07:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
many well I don't know if many but I
 
07:33:16.850 --> 07:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
hope if this committee supports this
 
07:33:19.788 --> 07:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
bill that they will be as quickly to
 
07:33:21.530 --> 07:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
support a parent's Bill of Rights
 
07:33:24.830 --> 07:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
because what I heard today in defense of
 
07:33:27.650 --> 07:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
this was exactly what I heard opposing
 
07:33:30.350 --> 07:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
last session for the parents bills of
 
07:33:32.628 --> 07:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
Rights it's not needed it's not
 
07:33:35.448 --> 07:33:35.458 align:start position:0%
necessary it's all in here or it's all
 
07:33:36.530 --> 07:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
in here
 
07:33:40.548 --> 07:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:42.350 --> 07:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you thank you very much
 
07:33:44.868 --> 07:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions
 
07:33:48.230 --> 07:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you once again and thank
 
07:33:50.090 --> 07:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned that you were in
 
07:33:51.770 --> 07:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
support of a parent's Bill of Rights as
 
07:33:53.690 --> 07:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
well and I see these two things as
 
07:33:55.968 --> 07:33:55.978 align:start position:0%
standing in stark contrast to each other
 
07:33:58.968 --> 07:33:58.978 align:start position:0%
but regardless of that what other group
 
07:34:00.948 --> 07:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
or entity do you believe deserves a Bill
 
07:34:02.690 --> 07:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
of Rights is this just Limitless in
 
07:34:04.250 --> 07:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
every group every organization should
 
07:34:06.288 --> 07:34:06.298 align:start position:0%
get its own Bill of Rights
 
07:34:08.150 --> 07:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
with regards to the parents Bill of
 
07:34:10.070 --> 07:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
Rights the the parents Bill of Rights
 
07:34:12.590 --> 07:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately parents rights have been
 
07:34:14.868 --> 07:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
violated in our school systems in our
 
07:34:17.570 --> 07:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
state in our in our schools in our
 
07:34:19.788 --> 07:34:19.798 align:start position:0%
school boards in our state in our nation
 
07:34:23.390 --> 07:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
so that's why we need a parent's Bill of
 
07:34:26.150 --> 07:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
Rights unfortunately in our state in my
 
07:34:26.160 --> 07:34:27.468 align:start position:0%
Rights unfortunately in our state in my
opinion

07:34:27.468 --> 07:34:27.478 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
07:34:27.478 --> 07:34:28.548 align:start position:0%
opinion
um

07:34:28.548 --> 07:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:34:31.730 --> 07:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
because parents don't have the ability
 
07:34:35.510 --> 07:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
to bring litigation in yes there's a
 
07:34:38.390 --> 07:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
process but that process has a huge
 
07:34:41.030 --> 07:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
financial burden
 
07:34:44.090 --> 07:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
um students on the other hand all of
 
07:34:46.430 --> 07:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
their Bill of Rights are protected
 
07:34:49.730 --> 07:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
through their parents and through
 
07:34:52.250 --> 07:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
through the Constitution but also
 
07:34:54.110 --> 07:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
through their parents because the
 
07:34:57.530 --> 07:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
parents bottom line is is that every
 
07:34:59.628 --> 07:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
right that a student holds every right
 
07:35:02.990 --> 07:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
that a child holds that ultimate
 
07:35:05.270 --> 07:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility is the parents if the
 
07:35:08.390 --> 07:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
parent does If the child does something
 
07:35:11.030 --> 07:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
that is against the law or that is
 
07:35:13.730 --> 07:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
against someone else's right that parent
 
07:35:16.310 --> 07:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
is held accountable
 
07:35:18.530 --> 07:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
if the parent does something wrong is
 
07:35:20.270 --> 07:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
this if the school does something wrong
 
07:35:22.730 --> 07:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
is the school held accountable to the
 
07:35:25.010 --> 07:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
parent is the school held accountable to
 
07:35:26.930 --> 07:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
the child
 
07:35:28.730 --> 07:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
that's why we need a parent's Bill of
 
07:35:31.250 --> 07:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
Right versus a child's bill right thank
 
07:35:36.850 --> 07:35:36.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:39.350 --> 07:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
it'll be two seconds I swear that's what
 
07:35:42.230 --> 07:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
I said representative Potenza I wasn't
 
07:35:44.090 --> 07:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
going to speak
 
07:35:44.100 --> 07:35:50.510 align:start position:0%
going to speak
foreign

07:35:50.510 --> 07:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:52.628 --> 07:35:52.638 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Potenza again
 
07:35:55.368 --> 07:35:55.378 align:start position:0%
Rochester's Stratford District 19
 
07:35:58.910 --> 07:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
Rochester one through four and six
 
07:36:02.390 --> 07:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
um so of course I uh strongly oppose the
 
07:36:02.400 --> 07:36:03.350 align:start position:0%
um so of course I uh strongly oppose the
spill

07:36:03.350 --> 07:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
spill
 
07:36:05.150 --> 07:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
um for a number of different reasons
 
07:36:07.430 --> 07:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
that were already covered but I'd just
 
07:36:10.128 --> 07:36:10.138 align:start position:0%
love to say this because
 
07:36:12.230 --> 07:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
where were all of these people that put
 
07:36:15.530 --> 07:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
this bill in when the child that was
 
07:36:19.150 --> 07:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
from the Exeter Middle School
 
07:36:25.250 --> 07:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
or a Thin Blue Line flag shirt to school
 
07:36:27.830 --> 07:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
one said anything no one was coming out
 
07:36:30.770 --> 07:36:30.780 align:start position:0%
these parents have now had to take this
 
07:36:33.770 --> 07:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
on themselves hiring an attorney in
 
07:36:37.010 --> 07:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
litigation and fees it's ridiculous they
 
07:36:39.890 --> 07:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
allow the American flag they allow the
 
07:36:41.390 --> 07:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
rainbow flag
 
07:36:44.868 --> 07:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
but a student wears a flag that looks
 
07:36:47.090 --> 07:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
like the American flag that has The Thin
 
07:36:50.270 --> 07:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
Blue Line because his parent was in law
 
07:36:50.280 --> 07:36:51.468 align:start position:0%
Blue Line because his parent was in law
enforcement

07:36:51.468 --> 07:36:51.478 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
07:36:53.930 --> 07:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
and he's literally taken out of the
 
07:36:56.750 --> 07:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
class and put in a room
 
07:36:59.390 --> 07:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
until his parents could come and change
 
07:37:02.448 --> 07:37:02.458 align:start position:0%
his shirt so that's where we're at I
 
07:37:04.690 --> 07:37:04.700 align:start position:0%
just don't understand how
 
07:37:07.368 --> 07:37:07.378 align:start position:0%
we just um
 
07:37:09.288 --> 07:37:09.298 align:start position:0%
it's good for one group it's not good
 
07:37:10.670 --> 07:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
for other there's just a lot of
 
07:37:13.490 --> 07:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
hypocrisy here I really I like it I
 
07:37:14.570 --> 07:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
think we should say this bill
 
07:37:16.670 --> 07:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
establishes a parent student Bill of
 
07:37:18.350 --> 07:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
Rights and then we'll have to still
 
07:37:20.868 --> 07:37:20.878 align:start position:0%
amend a ton of it but I think then we
 
07:37:22.968 --> 07:37:22.978 align:start position:0%
cover all bases right
 
07:37:24.708 --> 07:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
um because that's these are minors that
 
07:37:29.270 --> 07:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here so uh but I
 
07:37:31.810 --> 07:37:31.820 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill and uh please
 
07:37:34.368 --> 07:37:34.378 align:start position:0%
IDL thank you thank you very much
 
07:37:34.378 --> 07:37:39.310 align:start position:0%
IDL thank you thank you very much
questions

07:37:39.310 --> 07:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:42.350 --> 07:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
see the young one it's okay though
 
07:37:45.410 --> 07:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you taking my question in
 
07:37:47.330 --> 07:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
this build do you see anything that
 
07:37:49.670 --> 07:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
would stipulate this to just k for 12 or
 
07:37:51.350 --> 07:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
is this extended to college students
 
07:37:53.208 --> 07:37:53.218 align:start position:0%
such as myself do these student Bill of
 
07:37:56.030 --> 07:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
Rights apply to me and my peers
 
07:37:58.968 --> 07:37:58.978 align:start position:0%
I agree I think this is very open-ended
 
07:38:01.128 --> 07:38:01.138 align:start position:0%
in so many ways and it is
 
07:38:06.048 --> 07:38:06.058 align:start position:0%
um like rasan stated a slippery slope uh
 
07:38:07.730 --> 07:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
with a lot of different things
 
07:38:09.288 --> 07:38:09.298 align:start position:0%
um you know I love some stuff that's in
 
07:38:11.810 --> 07:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
here the freedom exercise of religion I
 
07:38:13.190 --> 07:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
think we desperately need that in
 
07:38:15.650 --> 07:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
schools so if you're telling me that a
 
07:38:17.448 --> 07:38:17.458 align:start position:0%
student is going to be able to put up a
 
07:38:19.548 --> 07:38:19.558 align:start position:0%
whole big billboard of everything that
 
07:38:21.948 --> 07:38:21.958 align:start position:0%
they believe about Jesus Christ and all
 
07:38:24.288 --> 07:38:24.298 align:start position:0%
of that let's see if the school is going
 
07:38:26.270 --> 07:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
to let that happen like this is
 
07:38:26.280 --> 07:38:28.430 align:start position:0%
to let that happen like this is
unfortunately

07:38:28.430 --> 07:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
07:38:32.650 --> 07:38:32.660 align:start position:0%
um you know really only I believe uh
 
07:38:36.288 --> 07:38:36.298 align:start position:0%
helping one-sided view of things thank
 
07:38:39.410 --> 07:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
you further questions not seeing thank
 
07:38:41.090 --> 07:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
you very much and that will close this
 
07:38:41.100 --> 07:38:42.850 align:start position:0%
you very much and that will close this
