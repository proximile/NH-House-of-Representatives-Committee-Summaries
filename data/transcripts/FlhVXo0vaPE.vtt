time I would ask everybody who's here to
 
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
testify this morning on the three bills
 
00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
that I just mentioned to be mindful of
 
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's a busy day for the
 
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
committee and we very much need our
 
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
lunch break from 12 to 1 or 12ish to
 
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
oneish so I would ask you all as you
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
testify on these bills to be mindful of
 
00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 align:start position:0%
the time you're taking to be as succinct
 
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
as possible try not to repeat what other
 
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
people are are saying so that we can
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
have some assurance that we can get out
 
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
of here in time to relax a little bit
 
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
between a busy morning and what will be
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
a busy
 
00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 align:start position:0%
afternoon and so with that I'm going to
 
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
open a public hearing on the first bill
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%

Warner and I'm here to uh present hb1
 
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
1431 on uh relative to utility
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for integrated distribution
 
00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
planning um I think we are all aware of
 
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
the history of the LCP statute which was
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh killed last year in the Senate
 
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill that came down to us uh and
 
00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
uh it also appeared in a in a in a house
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
bill and the argument I remember at the
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
time for for killing it was that that
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
the LCP statute was an out outdated
 
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
statute coming from the days when the
 
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
utilities own their own uh generation
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
sources and uh it had fallen into disuse
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
and uh disrepute and was no longer
 
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
really any service at all so uh we
 
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
killed it off the problem with that is
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
that it is the only statute that gives
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
the utility the Public Utilities
 
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
Commission the uh statutory authority to
 
00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 align:start position:0%
carry out its oversight duty of
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
balancing the needs of private
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
shareholders with the needs of the
 
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
public to receive a service in a
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
beneficial manner um so I I seem to
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
recall at the time the word on the
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
street that was that we were going to
 
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
try to bring this back in some form or
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
other so this bill HB 1431 is an attempt
 
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
to do that it's an attempt to give the
 
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission the
 
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to carry out its
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
oversight Duty and to give the public
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
the the needed weight it needs on on its
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
side in the form of a a requirement for
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
the utilities to carry out a long-term
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
strategic uh Vision visioning visioning
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
plan of what their needs are balanced
 
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
and integrated with the needs of the
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
public in terms of Public Health in
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
terms of the environmental impacts and
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of cost impacts of their
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
strategic needs and their infrastructure
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
needs um so that's what this bill is I
 
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
have shared an amendment with you or at
 
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
least I I uh shared it by email I've got
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
now and basically the amendment is to
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
fix two deficiencies if I can just
 
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
describe it really briefly the original
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill has no word no language in it uh uh
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
about Gas Utilities and also has no
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
enforceability mechanism and I think
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
we'd all agree that uh you know a
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
requirement with no enforceability
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
mechanism is a useless requirement um so
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
those are the two main differences
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
between the amendment and the original
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
bill as you see it before you
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's it in a nutshell uh
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is basically an attempt to
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
reinstate the statutory Authority that
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
we need for the Public Utilities
 
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
Commission to carry out its duty to
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
oversee the utilities in a balanced
 
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
manner between the the needs of its of
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
the private shareholders of the
 
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
utilities and the needs of the public to
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
receive a service in a beneficial manner
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
you know in essence right now we have a
 
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
vehicle that's running on three
 
00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:34.519 align:start position:0%
cylinders uh and my view is that if we
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
don't get it into the shop to fix it it
 
00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:38.919 align:start position:0%
it's you know it might carry on working
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
and get us to point B but it might just
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
suffer a breakdown so this is a guard
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
rail it's a necessary uh it's a
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
necessary part of the mechanism to make
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
the the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
function in the way it's intended to do
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%

00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you representative cap
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
for public input which is an important
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
thing that was removed when we when this
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
um statute was killed thank you yeah I
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
mean the uh the the requirement for the
 
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
utilities to file a plan uh is is in the
 
00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
in the context of an a judicative
 
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
proceeding which means that it's a it
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
has has to be duly noted in a public

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
question is around um the second piece
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
you spoke of which is the enforcement
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism that's intended in the bill
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
could you say a little more about that
 
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
well I mean the the original bill has no
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism it allows the
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
utilities to submit a plan uh if the
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
plan is rejected they have up to a year
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
to submit another plan and then that
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
process just continues until the plan is
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh is approved if it's not approved the
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
previous plan is still in effect so you
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
know that's fine but it's it's sort of
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
becomes an empty bureaucratic exercise
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
in my in my you know estimation so uh
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
the enforceability mechanism in the
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
amendment is that uh you know after two
 
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
attempts they're they are no longer
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to proceed with rate rate making
 
00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
uh rate changes so that you know
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
basically gums up the works to an extent
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
so it does require them to have a plan
 
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
an updated plan every five years on file
 
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
and I followup yeah thank you so my
 
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
followup would be around section 378 37
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
which is the first section of the bill I
 
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
know that there was some contention last
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
year about not losing that piece which
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
is basically a purpose statement right
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
um and so we left that in place and now
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
we've got several bills that attempt to
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
rewrite that piece so could you tell us
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit about uh how the language
 
00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:43.959 align:start position:0%
of this piece came about because I
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
actually I like this language I like the
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
way it it covers um covers the piece
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
without pushing it in any One Direction
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
but um right I mean the difference
 
00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
between the 378 37 uh as you see it in
 
00:11:59.069 --> 00:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
this bill and the original language
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
which um there are there are a couple
 
00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
differences I don't have I don't have
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
the original Statute in front of me
 
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
right now and I can tell you that you
 
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
know I received feedback from several
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
people who helped me write this and so
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
that you know it depends on on who who
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
who gave me some of the direction on
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
that but uh it does attempt
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
to uh I mean it it starts off with a
 
00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
consideration of the financial stability
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
of the state's utility so that that is
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
the number one thing right off the bat
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
uh and it but it does provide for the
 
00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:34.839 align:start position:0%
needs of the public as I said to receive
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
a service in a beneficial manner
 
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.790 align:start position:0%
a service in a beneficial manner
including

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh cost effective Energy Efficiency
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh demand side uh resources that would
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
be distributed generation uh and
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
protection safety and health of citizens
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal environment and future supplies
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
of resources so it does attempt to wait
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
uh you know to carry out that balance
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
ing act so to speak of of the needs of
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
the utility to receive a guaranteed rate
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
of return and the needs of the of the
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
citizens to receive a service in a
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
beneficial manner including everything a
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
holistic kind of look at everything
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
environment Public Health uh and all
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
those sort of things thank you
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a
 
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh represent Kaplan um uh at the very
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
bottom of the first page line 31
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
section four there's a requirement that
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
the plan include an assessment of
 
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
potential nonwired solutions for
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
electric distribution I I have no clue
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
what that might be could you explain
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
that a little further that's a great
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
question representative and I'm going to
 
00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:50.839 align:start position:0%
defer to somebody coming after me
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully one of the uh expert witnesses
 
00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519 align:start position:0%
that will be up here at the table after
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
me will be able to answer that with more
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
pertinent and exact information than I
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
have Vice chair Thomas has a question
 
00:14:04.749 --> 00:14:04.759 align:start position:0%
for you thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question just uh because this
 
00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
bill seems to be all-encompassing did
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
you happen to confer with all of our
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
state utilities to get their to get
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
their input I did not confer with all of
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
them I conferred with ever
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
Source representative
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
followup um no I'll wait thank
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington has a
 
00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:27.759 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I I read this
 
00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:31.959 align:start position:0%
bill and it's sort of like wide open so
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
I guess I have two questions first do
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
you think that the Pu is not doing its
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
job and has to be directed by statute on
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
how to do it right and second having
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
seen this before when we had this
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
planning mode back some years ago when I
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
was on the commission it was like a wide
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
open season for anybody to come in and
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
challenge anything and they could go
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
after the because this bill has no
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
limits on it it seems like they could go
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
after anything is am I missing something
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't really see where you're
 
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
coming from I mean it seems like there's
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
pretty specific language about I mean
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
are you looking at the original bill or
 
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment because the the original
 
00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
Bill does is a little bit more wide open
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
than the amendment the amendment is very
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
specific in terms of uh you know what uh
 
00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
what the what details should be in the
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
plan and the the process by which the
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
plan is filed and uh the process by
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
which the public has input I mean do you
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
believe that the puc should not have
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
should not be required to be under any
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
kind of scrutiny I I don't think that's
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
really uh intended in in in the statutes
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
that set up the Public Utilities
 
00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
Commission the reason we have laws the
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
reason we have regulations is because
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a Public Utilities
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
Commission overseeing a utility it's a
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
kind of a jury rigged cont Contraption
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's not purely Market base it's not
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
purely centralized planning it's kind of
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
a hybrid system it needs regulation and
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean there there is a kind of
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
a a bureaucratic element to the process
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
I agree with you on that but it we
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
haven't come up with a better system we
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
need to have some kind of guard rail so
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
that the public has some weight on its
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
side and it's not just purely about the
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
current accounting for the for the
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
private company otherwise it's not uh
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's not you know we're not doing our
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
job of overseeing the public utility for
 
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:24.759 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
public as we're not here to debate I
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
okay further questions uh for the
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative I have one for you uh
 
00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:38.839 align:start position:0%
does your
 
00:16:38.839 --> 00:16:40.470 align:start position:0%
does your
legislation

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
estimate the costs that would be
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
incurred by the Pu to undertake these uh
 
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.829 align:start position:0%
incurred by the Pu to undertake these uh
Plan

00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
Plan
 
00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:51.670 align:start position:0%
Plan
reviews

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
reviews
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
and can you give us some idea of what uh
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
rape payers would end up having to pay
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
in order for these plans to be reviewed
 
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
by the
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
commission yeah I mean this is basically
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
a Manpower exercise and so what what the
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
Staffing requirements for the Pu in
 
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
order to carry this out I can't really
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
answer that question I think you should
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
really be asking the Pu there is no
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
so well as you I'm sure can surmise no
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
utility business could stay in Business
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
Without doing long range planning of the
 
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
sort that this legislation would
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
require so would you agree that it's
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
safe to assume that utilities are
 
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
already doing this planning
 
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
internally today no I disagree with you
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative with all due respect I I
 
00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
don't think the utilities left to their
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
own devices would do long-term planning
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh to consider any sort of public
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
benefit in terms of the environment in
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
terms of Public Health uh if they
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
weren't required to do so if they if
 
00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799 align:start position:0%
it's not built into if it's not built
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
into their pricing structure in some
 
00:18:02.909 --> 00:18:02.919 align:start position:0%
form or fashion their fiduciary duty to
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
their shareholders leaves them no reason
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
at all to consider a public benefit why
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
would they do it that's why we have to
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
have a a regulation like this in place
 
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
because it's not built into the current
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
system well since you mentioned that
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up with another question in
 
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
the original bill on line 28 it says
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
that an assessment of the plan's long
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
and short-term Environmental
 
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.190 align:start position:0%
and short-term Environmental
and

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
economic and energy price impact on the
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
state is part of this plan isn't that
 
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
kind of outside the scope of
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
what a distribution plan would be all
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
about well not for a public utility uh
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
representative with all due respect I
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
mean the reason we have the reason it's
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
called a public utility is because it's
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to function uh in in benefit of
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
the public and the you know when you're
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
talking about short uh what is it long
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
and short-term environmental economic
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
and energy price impact I mean yeah the
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
energy price impact would be included in
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
any any any private company's plans but
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the long and short-term
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
environmental impact I don't
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
think I would think okay we we'll leave
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
it at that representative Thomas has a
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um on line
 
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:26.919 align:start position:0%
12 you talk about the physical
 
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
environment and then on line 28 you just
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
talk about environment so are physical
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
environment and environment the same
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
thing and is there a legal definition of
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
physical environment Does it include
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
infrastructure okay line 12 the physical
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
environment of the State uh I am not
 
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
sure if there's a legal definition of
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
that but I would think that yes that
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
would Encompass all the things that you
 
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.870 align:start position:0%
would Encompass all the things that you
mentioned

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
Harrington has one thank you thank you
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so just listening
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
to what you just said it I'm I'm
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
concluding then and I'm asking this as a
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
question you assume that the Pu is not
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
doing its job to take care of the
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
benefit Because unless they given
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
specific legislative Direction they
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
won't take into account environment
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
public good all this other stuff uh that
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be taking in by
 
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
Statute already so you need to the
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
saying I think that the that the
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
requirement of the utilities to file a
 
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
10-year plan is not only yes it it is a
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
a doubling down so to speak of the
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority the Public Utilities
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
Commission but it also gives the public
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
a process by which they can take part
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
and have some sort of impact and say in
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
what these plans should should include
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
and I I think that's a necessary thing
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
input additional questions for the
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative we have four more people
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
who would like to speak so I'd like to
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
move on if that's acceptable to the
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
committee and I would like to next call
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
on the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
energy represented by Mr
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
frons good morning Mr fron and welcome
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
to st&amp; good to see you good to see you
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
two members of the committee my name is
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
Tom France I'm the director of
 
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory at the New Hampshire
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
Department of energy previous to that I
 
00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:39.559 align:start position:0%
was with the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
for many many many years as director of
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
electric and at one point uh Chief
 
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
Economist the New Hampshire Department
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
of energy appreciates this opportunity
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
and we want to just clearly state that
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
we are not opposed to lease cost
 
00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.590 align:start position:0%
we are not opposed to lease cost
planning

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
planning
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
in general as a principle however we
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill is needed uh we
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
think it has faults and we do oppose
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
this bill for many of the same reasons
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
that we did for the lease cost uh
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
integrated resource plans last year uh
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
I'll start by saying that the standard
 
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to regulations really is
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
safe reliable service atj and reasonable
 
00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:23.110 align:start position:0%
safe reliable service atj and reasonable
rates

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of things in here that
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
we already do we have
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
uh tremendous review of the
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
utilities Energy Efficiency programs
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
they're filed every three years uh
 
00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:41.559 align:start position:0%
they're looked at they're basically set
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
out in statute for what the budgets are
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
as you well know and we take a close
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
look at those programs we do look at
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
Alternatives I want to be clear that uh
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
in a rate
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
case and it might be different if rate
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
cases were filed every 10 to 20 years
 
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:00.039 align:start position:0%
but we we seem to see rate cases that
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
are filed with the Public Utilities
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
Commission Now on about a 3 to four year
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
basis before
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
those changes and rates go into effect
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
and those capital projects are approved
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of time and effort as do
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
others uh
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
including the
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
OCA looking at what those Al
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
alternatives are and whether or not the
 
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
utility chose the lowest cost lost for
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
the for the risk that was needed or for
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
the demand for that service whether it's
 
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.029 align:start position:0%
the demand for that service whether it's
a

00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
substation uh whatever that may be and
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
and a great example is what we did in
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
the recent testimony in the Liberty
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
Utilities uh electric
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
case so I think there's a lot of good
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
things that are uh intended by this
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
legislation I just don't actually think
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
they're needed and I think in some ways
 
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
they're duplicative and costly least
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
cost integrated resource plans that we
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
used to have often took well over a year
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
to for the Pu to adjudicate sometimes up
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
to 18 months um it took a tremendous
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
amount of resources from the Department
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
of energy I'm sure from the Pu and from
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
others to actually look at the plans
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
they evolved they changed and so that's
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
always been a concern we have
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
a resource constraint as everybody does
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
and we put a lot of resources into the
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
rate cases that are before us and as I
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have a gas and electric
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
utility rate case before uh the Pu right
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
now that we're deeply involved in uh we
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
expect to see another rate case possibly
 
00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:45.559 align:start position:0%
two electric rate cases in 2024 and I
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
think that's the place that we need to
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
answer these questions look at the costs
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
and uh many of the things that are in
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
here we'll be taking a look at in those
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
cases so I respectfully uh appreci
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the intent of this but want
 
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
to say that we the department of energy
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
does oppose it I also have a concern on
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
one area about the
 
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
amendment I haven't had time and we
 
00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:12.919 align:start position:0%
haven't taken it back to look at but
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
when I hear
 
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.630 align:start position:0%
when I hear
that

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
uh and we appreciate that it may have
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
teeth I I I do appreciate that but when
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
you say after a couple chances you
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
strike out and no changes in rates that
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
raises a red flag right away because
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
every 6 months default Service rates are
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
changing and I don't think that's a
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
great idea to not have default Service
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
rates change every six months because an
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
approved thank you questions from the
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
committee repres uh Vice chair Thomas
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
has a question oh thank you Mr chair
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um it
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
was inferred earlier in testimony
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
that it's only natural that Public
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
Utilities would not be after the public
 
00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:05.799 align:start position:0%
interest um do you think that this bill
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
though with the things that are in it do
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
you think that would ensure more public
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
input and and put more teeth into the
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
utilities uh looking after public
 
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
interest I think in some ways this bill
 
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.870 align:start position:0%
interest I think in some ways this bill
would

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
actually perhaps read in the utilities
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
View and they can speak for themselves
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh view it as reducing their risk uh
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
example it it goes back away
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
so have some patience with me when we
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
restructured the industry uh back in
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
1997 98 99 the order that came out from
 
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
the commission had to do with strained
 
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
cost and whether than not all the
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
utilities at the time of course were
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated uh met their
 
00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
burdens and to reduce straining costs
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut Val electric company
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
which was a subsidiary of central
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
Vermont public service at the time the
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
puc's decision was that they should have
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
divested their purchase power agreements
 
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
with with Central Vermont Public Service
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
and therefore they were on the hook for
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
many many millions of dollars of
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
strained costs that the commission said
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
they their shareholders should actually
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
eat they took us to court um and I
 
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
participated in that we were also at the
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
firk and their one of their main
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
arguments was well the the decision that
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
the Pu made
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
here is unwarranted because they've seen
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
our lease cost plans every couple years
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
they've approved them they've understood
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
the planning process and therefore they
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
can't come back now and say that we
 
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
should have done this or done that that
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
should have been in the orders of the
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
puc as part of the lease cost integrated
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
resource plans at the time that were on
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
file so I think utilities uh often view
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
these as once those plans are approved
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
and legal people can argue about this
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
but certainly that was their main
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
argument at the time that these plans
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
protected them now again as as I've said
 
00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
utilities should do good forecasting
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
utilities should look at Alternatives
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
utilities should be looking at things
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
that actually bring the same value to
 
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
their customers for the lowest cost
 
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
possible and and I think the best place
 
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
to do that is actually through a rate
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
case followup uh thank you for the
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
followup so are you saying that
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
um the Pu actually would be uh uh that's
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
part of the job is to look to see if the
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
utilities are working in the public
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
interest and doing all these four range
 
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
plannings when they when they do they
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
they review cases so would you see the
 
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
that's part of the puc's job anyway yes
 
00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
okay representative McGee has a question
 
00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr France
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um I notice
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
you know this is a a stab at replacing
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
what we lost with the LCP and trying to
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
sort of reinstate in statute
 
00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.149 align:start position:0%
sort of reinstate in statute
language

00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
um that seem to be important in terms of
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
the process right to make sure that
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere it was covered what it is that
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
we would like out of integrated planning
 
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
and so it it doesn't say least cost here
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
while it does say cost considerations
 
00:29:47.549 --> 00:29:47.559 align:start position:0%
are important and need to be part of the
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
formula so my question is I
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
I'm am I mistaken that this what is the
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
substance of um
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
the items that are detailed in the
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
amendment in terms of what would be in
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
statute for review that those do not
 
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
appear anywhere else in New Hampshire
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
point I'm not sure they're in statute um
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
think I'd have to probably confer with
 
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
our attorneys but non- wires
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
Alternatives I'm not sure are in
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
statutes but they are certainly part of
 
00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:29.519 align:start position:0%
a rate case uh because we'd sit there
 
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
and say and others should you know if
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
the utility could have brought the same
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
level of reliability or met certain
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
demand requirements for $100 but instead
 
00:30:40.159 --> 00:30:41.909 align:start position:0%
demand requirements for $100 but instead
spent

00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
$150 that's not a very prudent decision
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
in our opinion and we would make that
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
case at the Pu and we have made those
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
cases at the Pu and then it's up to the
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
PC decide whether or not uh that was
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
based on the record and and if so they
 
00:30:59.789 --> 00:30:59.799 align:start position:0%
should disallow anything above what the
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
actual cost should have been and would
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
have been prudently incurred to get the
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
same level of service reliability for
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
customers okay and followup followup
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
okay so then following that logical
 
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
conclusion um and understanding that a
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
lot of what is in here is is uh among
 
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.350 align:start position:0%
lot of what is in here is is uh among
the

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the doe and the Pu
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
as it is today would you be willing to
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
work to try and figure out how this
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
language could be uh amended by the time
 
00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:34.519 align:start position:0%
we're going to be voting on this bill so
 
00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:38.519 align:start position:0%
that it actually uh reflects the work
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
that is undertaken so that we actually
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
have something in statute that says what
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
we want it to say I'm happy to take that
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
back and confer with the commissioner
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
and Deputy Commissioner and and normally
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
we're more than willing to to work with
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
people on language thank
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
you representative Bernardi has a
 
00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:59.710 align:start position:0%
you representative Bernardi has a
question

00:31:59.710 --> 00:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:04.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh so in the previous
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
testimony one of the key issues that
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
seems to be a driver for this uh
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
proposed bill is uh public input and so
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
I would like your assessment is the
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
public input that you see in this plan
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
somehow different than one would have in
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
public input in a rate case
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat yes um for a ray case and again
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
we have very competent attorneys behind
 
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
me uh and I'm sure Mr cre could answer
 
00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:40.710 align:start position:0%
me uh and I'm sure Mr cre could answer
that

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
but for standing at a as part of a
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
proceeding you normally have to show
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
that you have a interest so that if it's
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
an lease cost plan or some kind of
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
distribution resource uh planning
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
process integrated distribution planning
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure you could normally
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
intervene in that if you lived let's say
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon and it was an eversource
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
integrated distribution plan uh
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
certainly in a rate case you'd have to
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
have a clear connection to the actual
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
docket and case and how you would be
 
00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
affected and I would think that for
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
integrated distribution plan that would
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
also be the case although groups that
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
represent environmental interests that
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
are across the state or the region
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
they've often intervened and always that
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of been uh included in
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
proceedings so you have to show that you
 
00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
have an interest that your members would
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
be affected and I think you'd be allowed
 
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
in the Pu historically has been pretty
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
inclusive in its
 
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
proceedings representative Thomas has a
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um and thank
 
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
testified that this bill covers a lot of
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
things that the Pu already does would it
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
not be best practiced to protect the
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
Integrity of that of those procedures
 
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.149 align:start position:0%
Integrity of that of those procedures
and

00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
statute well I think they are basically
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
protected in statute for uh when it
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
comes to Safe reliable service adjust
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
and reasonable rates that uh authority
 
00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
of the puc to determine that based on
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
the record I think a lot of those things
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
are there when you actually look at what
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
goes into a ray case and the kind of
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
testimony as well as all the uh data
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
requests responses I think you'd come to
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that many many of these
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
issues are certainly uh covered
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
comprehensively as part of a full rate
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
case followup yes thank you followup so
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
you just said that a lot of those things
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
are already there but just clarification
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
but not all correct probably not all um
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean there's a lot of again there
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
are there's a lot of useful information
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
and and and in my opinion it's in one
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
place when you actually look at a lease
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
cost plan or an integrated distribution
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
plan uh that's a document that many
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
people would find useful I don't deny
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
that it's a one it's almost like
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
One-Stop shopping you can pick it up and
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
you can see a lot of really useful
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
information uh in one one spot instead
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
of hunting for it but we do get filings
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
of the utilities uh and the p certainly
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
gets them as part of their requirements
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
as part of the public utilities
 
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
commission's rules as part of our rules
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
there I have a question for you do
 
00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.230 align:start position:0%
there I have a question for you do
utilities

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
typically include in a rate case
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
environmental and economic issues the
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
potential of non-wire solutions the
 
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
costs and benefits of grid
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
modernization those kinds of things show
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
up and
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
cases to some degree the answer to that
 
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
is yes but uh for example there may be
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
grid modernization issues in a rate case
 
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
that may make uh
 
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
customers more able to take care take on
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
some of the things that are of interest
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
to customers such as perhaps EV charging
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
or uh demand reductions on certain
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
circuits uh there could be battery is
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
storage that's part of a rate case those
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
things are all put of there but as far
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
as actually looking at specific
 
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.750 align:start position:0%
as actually looking at specific
environmental

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
regulations uh we'll ask questions
 
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps about that but we're not first
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
and foremost either the Pu or the
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
Regulators so to follow up on that if
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
some of these issues are part of rate
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
cases what kind of an extra burden does
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
it add to the commission to evaluate
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
more amorphous uh questions and what
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
kind of an impact does that have on rate
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
payers well it's challenging um I just
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
said that we're not environmental
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
Regulators the Public Utilities
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
Commission is not an environmental
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
regulator um so I think it requires
 
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:29.079 align:start position:0%
additional resources and more time and
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
effort and probably some
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
more discipline as far as what exactly
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
or guidance in in uh the evaluation you
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
know there's might be a question of well
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
does this project or does this policy or
 
00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
this program reduce emissions okay well
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
it may reduce emissions to what level
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
should it reduce emissions well if
 
00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
there's not guidance there that's a
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
question what's the value of the avoided
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
emissions you know um some have markets
 
00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
some don't lots of argument about what
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
those markets should be is the price of
 
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
CO2 $20 per ton avoided or is it $20 per
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
ton avoided those things you you you end
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
up in dockets that can have long
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
discussions arguments and and
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh really disputes about a lot of
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
environmental and economic issues that
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that's the best place
 
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
before pu to do in general time is money
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
so is a longer docket cost more money to
 
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
adjudicate sure absolutely I mean
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
there's in some ways almost as much
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
resources go into
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
a resource planning docket as a rate
 
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
case depending on uh what's in it so
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
they can be very expensive then and and
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
time consuming okay thank you
 
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
France for taking my question you may
 
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
have just answered it but I really would
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
like to get some clarity here until last
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
year least cost integrated resource
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
planning was required so the Pu was
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
already evaluating those cases so can
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
you please explain the difference in
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
cost and effort uh between what the Pu
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
did have to do until uh that statute was
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
repealed versus what this statute this
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
bill would require well I think if you
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
look at those integrated resource plans
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
that the Pu did they took a very long
 
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
time some of them were outstanding for
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
over 18 months uh it there's an
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity costs so if you're spending
 
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of hours on an
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
integrated resource plan that's hundreds
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
of hours that you're not spending on
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
something else so unless you add more
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
resources or you're already
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh flush with resources which I don't
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
think the Pu would say they are and
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
certainly I don't think uh the
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy is that's things
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
that we're either going to have to hire
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
Consultants to do or something else gets
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's opportunity costs are real costs
 
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.069 align:start position:0%
it's opportunity costs are real costs
follow

00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
up thank you but I was asking in
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
specifically about the difference
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
between what was done and what this bill
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
would do not not just the effort that
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
this bill would require but just what's
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
the what what is the incremental
 
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
difference if any between what was done
 
00:40:41.309 --> 00:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
and what this bill would require thank
 
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
you for the clarification representative
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
and I'd have to say I'm not sure there
 
00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:46.309 align:start position:0%
and I'd have to say I'm not sure there
is

00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
any a lot of the things uh similar in
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
this that were in previous uh
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
statute representative Harrington has a
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman thank you
 
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:01.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question Tom um based on what
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
you just said and um it sounds like the
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
the bill uh if if it was to be Go full
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
would would need some guard rails right
 
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
now it's kind of like kind of fuzzy
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
protect the environment do all this good
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
stuff uh isn't that just a license to
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
litigate for certain you know
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
organizations that have three letters
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
that they go by uh they could tie this
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
PU up for months and months and months
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
and then they'd go to court on it and it
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
would just be litigation after
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
litigation is is that is without those
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
God Wills would that be happening that's
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
always a potential in any proceeding as
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
you know representative and uh we've
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
seen plenty of litigation and uh
 
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
integrated resource plans in the past uh
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's possible for any any any
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
proceeding and certainly this would be
 
00:41:53.839 --> 00:41:55.230 align:start position:0%
proceeding and certainly this would be
no

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
different okay let's get the utilities
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
perspective thank you Mr France
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here today thank
 
00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:02.839 align:start position:0%
you let's get the utilities perspective
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
on this and ask Mike Lata from
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
eversource to give us his take on this
 
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.470 align:start position:0%
eversource to give us his take on this
proposed

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
legislation good morning Mr
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
Lata good morning uh Michael Lata
 
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
representing eversource uh energy
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
you before before you this morning um
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
eversource uh does support uh the
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
legislation as introduced uh I did have
 
00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to uh see the amendment
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
previous uh earlier uh but I'm going to
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
focus my my comments on the bill that
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
was uh introduced and is before you
 
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
today um we believe that the legislation
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
represents a reasonable approach to
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
create a regulatory framework whereby
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
which utilities can present for review
 
00:42:57.069 --> 00:42:57.079 align:start position:0%
and approval before the Pu their
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
long-term uh planning uh criteria and
 
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
plans um the bill requires that every
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
five years uh electric distribution
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
utilities uh file uh these long-term uh
 
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
integrated distribution plans uh they're
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
fairly straightforward um called for
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
under the bill I I think it's um uh I I
 
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:23.720 align:start position:0%
would say very consistent with the
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
utility planning that we're doing today
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh so a 10-year load
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
forecast uh several assessments of
 
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
various factors that might impact those
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
forecasts for example the Energy
 
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs that are authorized
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
under other statutes the New Hampshire
 
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
safes programs um what we're seeing in
 
00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
terms of uh demand response programs
 
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
that would have been previously approved
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
by uh the Public Utilities Commission uh
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
customer adoption of uh I'll say
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
industry trends that are are driving
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
customer adoption of various you know
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's heat pumps or
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
electrification of the the
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
transportation system uh and so really
 
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
this is is what utilities do from a
 
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
planning perspective uh today and so you
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
know it sort of begs the question why is
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
utility up here before you saying we're
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
good with with more
 
00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
regulation um and I think you know Mr
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
France touched on on a number of the
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
areas quite frankly we see risk um
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
without a a planning framework uh
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
whereby we can present these Trends uh
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
let the commission let other
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders know what we're seeing uh
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
from a a high level prior to a rate case
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
so if you think of of a rate case that's
 
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
really the utility has has already gone
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
out and and built infrastructure to meet
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
that customer demand so we've upgraded a
 
00:44:57.309 --> 00:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
substation we've reinforced a a circuit
 
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
um and we're now bringing that uh into
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
the commission and seeking cost recovery
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
of those Investments that we've already
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
made um and so I think a lot of the
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
concerns that you heard from director
 
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
France about you know litigation risk or
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
open-ended or you know this will be a
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
lengthy exercise our fear is all of
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
those risks still exist they're just
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
pushed into the rate case and so we
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
would uh prefer a a a venue and and I
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
understand the concerns about open-ended
 
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
nature we we actually think that um this
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable approach but certainly
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
if if stakeholders would like to to work
 
00:45:41.069 --> 00:45:41.079 align:start position:0%
on uh refinements we we welcome that uh
 
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
but we would prefer a a more uh orderly
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
proceeding uh that is is done uh in
 
00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:51.079 align:start position:0%
advance of or or informing a future rate
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
case so you
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
know again why is the utility supporting
 
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
a bill with with more regulation because
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
we think that that the concerns raised
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
by uh the department of energy are real
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
uh and just get pushed into to another
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
venue um without uh without this
 
00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
framework um and you know to answer the
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
question can't the commission do this
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
this today um as you heard there there
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
are bits and pieces and other um other
 
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
proceedings the Energy Efficiency
 
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:24.559 align:start position:0%
proceeding you know a lot of this uh in
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
rate cases um
 
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
but absent uh absent this bill the
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
utilities don't have um the ability to
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
offer a plan and the commission have
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
approval of that plan uh that H carries
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
some Force so um with that I'd be happy
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that the
 
00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:47.559 align:start position:0%
committee may have thank you appreciate
 
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
your test I have a couple questions for
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
you the first one is a couple of weeks
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
ago ever Source gave a presentation to
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire transport ation
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
Council and during the course of that
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
presentation it indic
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
indicated and showed a slide about its
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
integrad distribution planning process
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
so it's clear that you already do this
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
process and my question would be if
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
you're already doing this process and
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
you could certainly share that plan with
 
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
the Pu why do we need legislation of
 
00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.510 align:start position:0%
the Pu why do we need legislation of
this

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
nature thank you for the question and uh
 
00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.309 align:start position:0%
nature thank you for the question and uh
just

00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
by way of background um we did give a
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
presentation to the uh New Hampshire
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
transmission uh Transportation sorry uh
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
Transportation Council uh at their
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
request uh they were interested in how
 
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
customer adoption of electric vehicles
 
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
was in impacting our utility planning
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
and I I just start off by saying we
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
would very much welcome the opportunity
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
to provide um a similar presentation to
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
this committee I I think um it would be
 
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
quite uh quite helpful in the context of
 
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
this um so absent uh a statutory
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
framework like the one that is um uh
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
considered as part of hb1
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
1431 there isn't that venue for us to
 
00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:15.640 align:start position:0%
provide that plan and have an
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding to review that
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
plan have stakeholders as with any
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding um if they have
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
standing engage in that obviously the
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
cons conser Advocate the department of
 
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
energy being uh uh two of them and then
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
have approval of that plan uh so absent
 
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
this framework there really isn't that
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
mechanism where the commission can say
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature has has told us to
 
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
review and and render judgment on these
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
plans which again helps
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
inform uh uh future uh decisions of the
 
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
utility and cost recovery of
 
00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.589 align:start position:0%
utility and cost recovery of
infrastructure

00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
Investments well my follow-up question
 
00:48:59.789 --> 00:48:59.799 align:start position:0%
would be who plan is this and the reason
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
I asked that plan if you look in the on
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
page two of the
 
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
legislation on line five it says the
 
00:49:10.109 --> 00:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
commission shall either approve reject
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
or modify the
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
plan the commission can modify the plan
 
00:49:16.349 --> 00:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
it's not your plan is it the
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
commission's plan so so uh I think this
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
is fairly consistent with um how the Pu
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
can SU conducts uh its proceedings where
 
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
the utility makes a filing whether it's
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
a rate case whether it's uh an Energy
 
00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:35.079 align:start position:0%
Efficiency filing the commission will
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
review that they could say nope throw
 
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
the whole thing out or yes this is the
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
best thing we've ever seen or we approve
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
this with the following stipulation so
 
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
uh so certainly the commission um based
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
upon the record that's in front of them
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh the testimony that's provided the
 
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
data requests that are provided uh could
 
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.030 align:start position:0%
data requests that are provided uh could
say

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
changes so did I understand you to say
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
that maybe the language of the bill
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
should say the commission shall either
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve or reject the
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
plan uh it could read approve
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve or or uh or or
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
reject I mean I i' have to take that
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
back and review it with the
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
team okay thank you additional questions
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative McGee
 
00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
has a question had a question let's see
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
okay my question is around uh the
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
difference in what an integrated uh
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
distribution planning requirement gets
 
00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
at which is that there are a lot of
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
moving pieces right now in how utilities
 
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
are operating um in terms of being able
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
to contract uh being able to participate
 
00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
in the in the wholesale markets being
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
able to um help us create new
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and also supporting the
 
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
distribution system so my question is
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
whether there is value in requiring an
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
integrated distribution plan for that
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
purpose for the purpose that um I think
 
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
what we're asking is that that holistic
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
planning that you're doing behind the
 
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
scenes that there is some requirement
 
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
and oversight for saying how are all
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
these pieces fitting together in order
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
to create a public utilities product
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
that is in the best interest of the
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
consumer yeah and maybe that would be a
 
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
question for Mr GRE as well but sure at
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
the end of the day um and I very much
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
agree with uh director France what we're
 
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
what we're seeking to achieve here is a
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
safe reliable system that meets our
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
customers needs at the lowest cost and
 
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
and so you know long-term planning is is
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
a critical component of that and it's
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
sort of one step in the process it is
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
not uh the end of the process by by any
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
stretch you know approval of these plans
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
does not relinquish the obligation of
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
the utility to continue to evaluate um
 
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
alternatives to to make the best
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
decisions present those decisions and
 
00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
defend them as part of a raid case um
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
but this is a a higher level look at
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
broader Trends um in terms of what our
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
customers are choosing the
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that's required to to
 
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
meet um uh those choices and you know
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
the costs and implications of that and
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
so you know I do want to point out that
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
this is a a distribution plan it's not a
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
generation plan uh it's not a
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
transmission plan uh those are areas
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
obviously as as a restructured utility
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
we don't own generation resources uh
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
transmission planning is something that
 
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
is done uh subject to F jurisdiction at
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
the regional level um but looking at
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
that broader you know what are the
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
different factors that in impact the
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
development of the distribution system
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
and the ab and the ability of the
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
utility to to offer a safe reliable
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
system that meets customers needs we we
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
think that that's uh an appropriate
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
framework representative Harrington has
 
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
a question thank you and thank you for
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I was going to ask
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
something different but I get to start
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
with this one because what you just said
 
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
I'm reading off of the bill it says
 
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
submission of integrated electric
 
00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
distribution and transmission plans and
 
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
you just stated it doesn't include
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
transmission so I I'm uh keeping my
 
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
focus on the bill as introduced not the
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
amendment I believe the amendment uh
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
calls in in uh transmission which is
 
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
something that would be a concern for us
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
because of the jurisdictional issues
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
okay in followup followup okay in both
 
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
of them they they have a thing that it
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
says that um it's the New Hampshire
 
00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:55.640 align:start position:0%
energy policy to make sure that future
 
00:53:58.990 --> 00:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
supplies of resources are taken into
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
consideration and the plan has to
 
00:54:04.589 --> 00:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
address that as one of the criteria how
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
would a utility electric utility in New
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have to weigh in on future
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
supply of resources I don't know if is
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
natural gas oil wind solar offshore wind
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
coal I
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
mean how how could you possibly do that
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
so I I I think um the future supplies of
 
00:54:24.319 --> 00:54:25.750 align:start position:0%
so I I I think um the future supplies of
resources

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh is the reference in
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
378 uh 37 the New Hampshire energy
 
00:54:31.119 --> 00:54:32.710 align:start position:0%
378 uh 37 the New Hampshire energy
policy

00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
which I have to compare to existing
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
statute but but that is I think either
 
00:54:41.309 --> 00:54:41.319 align:start position:0%
consistent with or or currently existing
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
statute um and so it does say that the
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
plan needs to be consistent with uh that
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
as part of the plan there needs to be an
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
assessment uh of the consistency with
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
the energy statute um uh but you know
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
that is a broad overarching statement
 
00:55:02.829 --> 00:55:02.839 align:start position:0%
and clearly we we don't own generation
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
resources we as the committee well knows
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
and you representative we we go to the
 
00:55:10.589 --> 00:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
market the market gives us uh what we
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
get so so I I think that that's existing
 
00:55:17.549 --> 00:55:17.559 align:start position:0%
um uh in the existing
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
law representative Bernardi has a
 
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh so uh
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Lotti you offered to present uh the
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
information you presented to the
 
00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
transportation committee um I would be
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
interested in to know if you can then
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
when you
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
present uh your expected uh uh
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
development needs in on the distribution
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
side if it could be divided or is
 
00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:50.839 align:start position:0%
divided into this is what we need to do
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
to maintain the current system all the
 
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
old stuff how do we keep it working
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
working this is what we need to do to
 
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
add to the system for growth in
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
population and this is what we need to
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
do to add to the system to cover
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
EVs and this is what we need to do to
 
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
add to the system to cover heat pumps
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
are those categories of growth and cost
 
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
available in your plan or could they be
 
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll have to
 
00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
so very much appreciate the opportunity
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
to have the folks who actually put
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
together these plans and and do the
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
forecasting uh come in and and talk
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
about how they do
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
that electrification of the
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
transportation system electrification of
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
the the heating um sector those are
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
inputs and criteria that we we consider
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
as part of our planning and I I think
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
they could speak to how they impact our
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
load and the infrastructure um required
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
in order to meet that that additional
 
00:56:59.230 --> 00:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
usage so I I think they could speak to
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
you we have two more people who would
 
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
like to testify on this bill and we're
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
running up against the time constraint
 
00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
here so um does anybody really need to
 
00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
ask another question of Mr
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
M okay thank you appreciate you being
 
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.630 align:start position:0%
M okay thank you appreciate you being

00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
you could keep your remarks as succinct
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
please thank you um thank you for
 
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak I understand we are
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
over time
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
already um but I have a handout um to uh
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
highlight the different uh topics uh to
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
introduce myself my name is Katherine
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
represent New Hampshire Sierra club and
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh we that is about 10 uh I'm sorry
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
15,000 people in the state and um we
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
support the the spirit of the bill um
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
and the promise to reinstate the
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
planning process uh to support rate
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
payer accountability
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
transparency economic Justice for the
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
current law for just and reasonable
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
rates that's RSA 37
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
8.8 um additions to the bill that uh
 
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
Sierra Club uh believes that could
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
strengthen uh the pursuit to reinstate
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
planning the planning process based on
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
these these four principles but uh I do
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
want to highlight that the planning
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
process is before they spend the money
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
and the rate case is after they spend
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
the money that is a really important
 
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.589 align:start position:0%
the money that is a really important
piece

00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
um uh so uh the first principle if it
 
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
looks like a
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
duck it's a duck um the plan should
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
include all the all of the
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh to improve to upgrade to
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
maintain to expand to reroute the
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure network of poles and
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
wires and Transformers and
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
pipelines and um all of the energy
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
infrastructure exam uh to must be
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
vigorously examined by the puc for rap
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
paers continued service transparency and
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
confidence confidence we need to have
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
confidence in the spending of our
 
01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
utilities and a way to do that is to
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
have a plan that people can look at and
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
have one place to see it before they
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
spend the money
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
um no one left behind principle all so
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
this bill only includes Electric
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
utilities as introduced this should
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
include all energy utilities Gas and
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
Electric right now that's all we have um
 
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
but we should it should be all of them
 
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
uh with the same planning procedures um
 
01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
as we did
 
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
before uh all utilities have large
 
01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
construction project plans we heard and
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
and I I believe Mr Vose the chairman was
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
talking about all the internal planning
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
that utilities do it it in fact happens
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
um and that planning process must be
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
made clear to rate payers to the
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
residents of the State uh in an
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
accessible transparent manner to provide
 
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
the entire picture prudency must be
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
paired with accountability to allow the
 
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
state agencies to impose to veto or
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
adjust these utility plans um to ensure
 
01:01:41.069 --> 01:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
prudence and just and reasonable
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
costs um f is for
 
01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:47.799 align:start position:0%
functional uh utilities are planning all
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
the time and um they don't wait they
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
don't sit there and say oh is it 10
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
years let's do that plan
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
they are planning in real time and um
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
the planning procedure should be
 
01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
functional um should be meaningful to
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
the utilities and to ratee payers uh it
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
is not in the best interest of residents
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
utilities Regulators or or the
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
businesses of the state to wait until a
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
complaint is filed or after a project is
 
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
constructed in a rate case to determine
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
if the project costs were prudent just
 
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
and reasonable you don't do that
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
afterwards and the last is all cost is
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
all cost the federal jurisdiction
 
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
includes Interstate transmission into
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
the wholesale Market the states have exu
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
exclusive jurisdiction over the
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
transmission of into the retail Market
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
so that's how they're
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
differentiated by the where the
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
electricity is going if it's going into
 
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
the wholesale Market or if it's going
 
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
into the retail
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
Market all of these expenditures that
 
01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
that get passed on to rate payers from
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
the wholesale or the retail transmission
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
projects either gas or you electric must
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
be rigorously audited and determined to
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
be prudent and just and reasonable by
 
01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.390 align:start position:0%
be prudent and just and reasonable by
the

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
Pu otherwise it doesn't
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
happen currently the state is allowed to
 
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
engage in federal proceedings they're
 
01:03:42.029 --> 01:03:42.039 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that they are not
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
restricted from the discussions at
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
firk this bill must require that the
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
state participate in federal proceedings
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
to protect rap
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
payers there are billions of dollars at
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
stake that are currently not being
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
examined and thank you very
 
01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
much okay questions for M
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
Corry seeing none I'd like to call the
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
last speaker on this bill and that is
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
Nick cof of the conservers and law
 
01:04:20.029 --> 01:04:20.039 align:start position:0%
foundation and I have passed out his
 
01:04:20.039 --> 01:04:21.670 align:start position:0%
foundation and I have passed out his
written

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'd ask you to be as brief
 
01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
as possible of course uh good morning
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and and other committee members
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
I'll be as brief as possible I'm Nick
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
cof from the conservation law Foundation
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
based here in conquered um you know
 
01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of testimony this
 
01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
morning and there's no other
 
01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive planning that's occurring
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
outside of the integrated resource
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
planning process you know this is what
 
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
was happening before the statute was
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
repealed and you know some of this
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
planning does you know sure does occur
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
during rate cases but you know that's
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
very very small piece of all the plan
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
elements that can occur and under New
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law there's currently no
 
01:04:59.710 --> 01:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
requirement for the Public Utilities
 
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
Commission to look at the public health
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
um impacts the environmental impacts um
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
any any diversity benefits that could
 
01:05:08.589 --> 01:05:08.599 align:start position:0%
result from utility planning there's no
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
other requirement in New Hampshire law
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so that that's certainly not
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
occurring in um in raid cases or any
 
01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
place else um same same goes with
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
respect to grid modernization sure you
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
know in um in rate cases you kind of get
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
bits and pieces of that you know there
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
might there might be um some sort of
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
peripheral consideration of those things
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
but there there's no holistic or
 
01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive docket where the Public
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission is considering grid
 
01:05:38.589 --> 01:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
modernization how do we build the grid
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
of the future um obviously electricity
 
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
demand is changing and there's no other
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um docket where we're sort
 
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
of considering how to how how to meet
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
those changes in the
 
01:05:50.839 --> 01:05:52.789 align:start position:0%
those changes in the
future

01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
um you know same same with respect to um
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
to non-wire Solutions um sure you know
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
there there's there's some con minor
 
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
consideration and raid cases but there's
 
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
not really a holistic docket where where
 
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission is
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
considering what sort of non-wire
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
solutions can we can we um you know put
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
forth that might obviate the need for
 
01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
some of these expensive substation or
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
distribution line Investments there's a
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
question before what what are non-wire
 
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
solutions well that's de demand
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
reduction measures that's and energy
 
01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799 align:start position:0%
storage there's just no docket anywhere
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
else where there's or proceeding
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere else where they're considering
 
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
all all these different
 
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
considerations um and then you know I I
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
agree with um the amendment that this
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
should also apply to to gas planning as
 
01:06:42.029 --> 01:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
well the gas planning is just important
 
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
it's currently not in the amendment as
 
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
it's in the bill as proposed um you know
 
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
there there's there's needs to to
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
applies to gas planning it can
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce costs and make sure
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we're spending money on the the
 
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
lease cost option rather than more
 
01:06:59.309 --> 01:06:59.319 align:start position:0%
expensive options um and finally in in
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
the bill as proposed you know as has
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
been recognize there's no there's no um
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
consequence to failure to have this plan
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
approved and so there there needs to be
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
some sort of consequence if um if the
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
plan is not approved long long story
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
short we we can't we cannot have this
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
post talk um process in rate cases where
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
um the Public Utilities Commission
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
considers for the first time if what the
 
01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
utility is doing is right and in the
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
best interests of of um New Hampshire we
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
need a spot check initially before they
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
go and spend those Investments to make
 
01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
sure that what they're doing is in the
 
01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
best interest of the state um and so
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's why public um integrated resource
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
planning was very important before the
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
repeal and why we need to reinstate
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
these requirements for New Hampshire I'm
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
01:07:46.799 --> 01:07:48.990 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
questions

01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Harrington has a
 
01:07:53.309 --> 01:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you and thank you for
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned two
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
things I'm trying to get straight you
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
said that the Pu or the utility I guess
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
in combination should take into account
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh in the environment in diversity now
 
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
we have specific laws dealing with the
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
environment and that's but those are are
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
done by Dees enforces those so are you
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
saying that the Pu should go above and
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
beyond those and what do you mean by
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
saying they should plan for diversity in
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
this plan and who's going to pay for and
 
01:08:23.709 --> 01:08:23.719 align:start position:0%
I mean my my diversity I mean diversity
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
of of resources not diversity of
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
personnel or anything like that what I
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
mean is you know are they you know are
 
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
we not putting all of our eggs in one
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
basket are we are we investing only in
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
one you know in one fuel source um or
 
01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
you know what are we only um buying from
 
01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
one fuel source in the case of electric
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
utilities you know which which places
 
01:08:42.269 --> 01:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
you know which makes rirs exposed to
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
volatile volatility in in uh the type of
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
fuel and with respect to um you know the
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
question about the environment sure it's
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
DS's um job to to sure that
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations are being
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
complied with
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
but you know that the state energy
 
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
policy is more than just cost it's more
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
than just whether where rates are just
 
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.430 align:start position:0%
than just whether where rates are just
and

01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable 378 37 currently you know it
 
01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
it it brings into account a lot of
 
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
different factors to make sure utility
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
spending is in the is in the public
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
interest and you know where where these
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
where these utilities are heavily
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
regulated by
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
Design I think I think we need to think
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
it more broadly about whether what
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
utilities are doing is in the public
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
interest not just whether it's going to
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
cost you know the costs are just and
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable but whether you know what
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
what the planning is doing is good for
 
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
the environment is good for it's good
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
for the public health of the state it's
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
good for um you know it's not going to
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
um result in volatility for prices for
 
01:09:42.199 --> 01:09:44.950 align:start position:0%
um result in volatility for prices for
rate

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
payers representative Ros has a question
 
01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks Nick for
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
being here um I want to you mentioned
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
the non- wirus Alternatives in your um
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
testimony I just want to give you
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
another chance to speak about that um
 
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
or yeah one thing that's happening a lot
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
out we know out there anecdotally and
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
reading the media there's a lot of
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
customers investment individual
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
homeowners and businesses are investing
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
in things like behind the meter
 
01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.990 align:start position:0%
in things like behind the meter
generation

01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
generation
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
solar behind the meter storage um load
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
man even load management even at the
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
residential level but certainly at um at
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
the business level in your opinion is
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
there a
 
01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.189 align:start position:0%
there a
way

01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:10:40.199 --> 01:10:42.790 align:start position:0%
way
that

01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
the in utility rate cases as you point
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
out they're they're looking at you know
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
post Hawk um evaluation of utility
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
Investments but is there way for the the
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
without integrated resource planning for
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
U utilities to account for and value the
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
kind of customer side Investments that
 
01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
are being that are being made I mean I I
 
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
think there's no sort of integrated
 
01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
process that's occurring you know in in
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
rate cases so and the Liberty um
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
utilities you know Liberty electric
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
docket Liberty is proposing a battery
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
storage it and so you know that that's
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
kind of that does that does get to to
 
01:11:31.229 --> 01:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
some of those um issues but there's no
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
sort of comprehensive or integrated
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
process whereby utilities are looking at
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
you know can we can we use you know
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
behind the meter front of the meter
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
storage whatever you know to for
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
reliability benefits for resiliency
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
benefits that there's not this
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
comprehensive process that's occurring
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
where where they're doing that you know
 
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
before they make these Investments and
 
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
so I would argue that in order to
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
modernize our grid we we need we need
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
that process you know before they go and
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
expenditures representative thas has a
 
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um and and
 
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here Mr kof and
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
answering my question um previous people
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
have testified that this bill would open
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
up a lot of
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
litigation um several people have said
 
01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
that I'm not a lawyer um however you are
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um don't can you answer this
 
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
question don't you have to have a legal
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
and legitimate reason to begin any
 
01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
litigation and wouldn't any legal
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
challenge in this process be
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate absolutely I mean
 
01:12:38.629 --> 01:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
um you know I've I've been an intervener
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
in some of these integrated resource
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
planning cases in the past
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
and anytime that I'm you know arguing
 
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
that utility hasn't done their job it's
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know because you know there there's
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
a legal basis for it or you know I find
 
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
that there's a legal basis for it so and
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
that you know I don't think this is a
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
recipe for for Vol um that's going to
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
open the floodgates for for litigation I
 
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
mean you know there there's the
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
utilities and the Public Utilities
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
Commission have had Decades of
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
experience with these with these um
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
processes and for you know I'm I'm not
 
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
really aware of a um the Public
 
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission ever denying one of
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
these um plans so really it's just an
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do a spot check on some
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
of the planning and and maybe make some
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
improvements so that we can ensure it's
 
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the state thank
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
you okay so our our last speaker on this
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
bill is M
 
01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
friedricks representing 350.org and
 
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
because we're running up against some
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
severe time restraints I'm going to have
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
minutes maybe you could ask your
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
person

01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh my name is m friedricks um and I'm uh
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
here with 350 NH um and I just wanted to
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
share a little bit of some of what I
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
have heard from other energy bills um
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
that were being heard before the Senate
 
01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
which is um that several businesses um
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
you know major manufacturers major
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
Employers in New Hampshire shared their
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
frustration with the New Hampshire
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
regulatory environment because they had
 
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
made major Investments um in solar for
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
example on their facilities and also in
 
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
um load management and in battery
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
storage and their frustration was that
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
um there wasn't a great sense of how
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
these resources were being incorporated
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
into the state's energy planning and
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
therefore made it very difficult for the
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
businesses to understand um and plan
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
economically and so um to representative
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
Reynold's um question
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
um you know our big concern is that um
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
without having some sort of stability
 
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
and planning it makes it very different
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
difficult from an economic environment
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
and it makes New Hampshire less
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
competitive economically because
 
01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
businesses can't take into consideration
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
what sort of benefits may come from the
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
utilities um should they plan for their
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
their energy system is there validity
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
and planning for that energy storage to
 
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
be available back to the Grid or should
 
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
it only be considered in terms of um
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
that energy storage being available for
 
01:15:31.709 --> 01:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
that business to use as needed and so
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
we're really already hearing from our
 
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
business community that the lack of
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
planning in this area makes it a more
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
difficult environment in which to make
 
01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
business decisions and it's not only um
 
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
you know businesses but um yes at the
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
smaller scale uh individual consumers
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
and certainly towns um and so you know
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
working um um and serving My Town um of
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
Durham uh one of the things we we have
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
been discussing and examining for
 
01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
example is battery storage and it's
 
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
important for us to understand the
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
incentives that may be there down the
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
future in order to understand what the
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
municipality should be investing in um
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
for our own energy costs um and I'm
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
happy to you know try and answer any
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
questions um certainly from a you know
 
01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
less technical standpoint but um
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully that my testimony is helpful
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of being able to share what
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
I've heard from businesses and what I
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
know that our own town is considering
 
01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative parshall has a
 
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
question no okay no questions thank you
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%

energy Technologies and I ask the prime
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor to uh introduce this legislation
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
to us good morning Representative Keith
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr chair and uh for the
 
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is Keith Ammon from
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
42 and I represent the towns of New
 
01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
Boston Mount Vernon and
 
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
lineboro and I'm before you today to
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
01:17:21.149 --> 01:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
1465 relative to studies of nuclear
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
energy Technologies I'll give you just a
 
01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
little bit of background in uh
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
2022 a bill was passed that came through
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
this committee House Bill
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
543 that created the study commission
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
for advanced uh nuclear
 
01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
technology and uh one this bill is one
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations of that commi
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
that commission
 
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
report so I I brought one to show you
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
here um and I also have copies that I'll
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
leave in the committee room for the
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
entire committee uh it's a 50-page
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
report and it includes another 50 pages
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
of meeting minutes so we held uh
 
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
meetings for a year last year most of it
 
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh where we invited different Advanced
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
nuclear uh manufacturers to come and
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
present uh to our commission uh along
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
with uh Federal regulatory bodies and
 
01:18:18.629 --> 01:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
some other industry experts and I want
 
01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
to recognize that representative
 
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
Harrington was the vice chair of that
 
01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
Commission and I know representative
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas uh came to many of the
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
meetings if uh if you'd like to find out
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
more about that commission and to people
 
01:18:34.629 --> 01:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
listening at home it's nuclear. energy
 
01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
is the easiest way but it's also
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
available on the state's
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
website so uh with that um in our
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
research for the commi for the
 
01:18:49.629 --> 01:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
commission we stumbled upon existing
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
statutes and I printed that out for you
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
it is um
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
chapter 162b of our
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
rsas and I printed out for you the
 
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
existing statute so this is already law
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
and this is what the bill attempts to
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
update um and I want to point out in
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
existing law I'd like to point out just
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
two aspects of existing law on the first
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
page at the
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
bottom uh RSA 162
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
B3 it says conduct cond conduct of
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
studies concerning changes in laws and
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
regulations with a view to Atomic
 
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
Industrial Development
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
and it says that each of the following
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
agencies shall
 
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
regularly study atomic energy and it it
 
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
lists the Department of Health and Human
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
Services the Department of Labor the
 
01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
Transportation the Public Utilities
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
Commission and the department of energy
 
01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
I'm reading on the back of the of the
 
01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.669 align:start position:0%
I'm reading on the back of the of the
second

01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
page uh and the Department of
 
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
Insurance the Council on resources and
 
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
development so already an existing
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
statute uh and I believe this law is
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
something like 60 years old believe it
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
or not that these departments are
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to regularly conduct studies of
 
01:20:00.239 --> 01:20:01.070 align:start position:0%
supposed to regularly conduct studies of
atomic

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
atomic
 
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
energy um and if I turn your attention
 
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
to section 162
 
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
B4 it talks about the appointment of one
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the state departments the head of one
 
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
of the state state departments concerned
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
as the as adviser to the governor with
 
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
respect to Atomic Industrial Development
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
and this position has a name it's the
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
coordinator of atomic development
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
activities and that's 162 B4 section
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
Roman num
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
4 so so this is existing statute that
 
01:20:39.149 --> 01:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
goes back to uh the atomic the birth of
 
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
the atomic age and it's being
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
ignored uh what little research we could
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
uncover this position of atomic energy
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
coordinator hasn't been filled since
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
something like 2007 and the person
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
listed last to fill it is has since
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
passed unfortunately so we can't ask him
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
any questions um so uh that was
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
interesting you know looking through our
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
state statutes so the bill
 
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
1465 I'm going to just highlight three
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
aspects of it one is simple uh simple
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
updating of
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
terminology we we use nuclear a lot more
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
than we use Atomic these days so uh and
 
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
we have the the nuclear Regulatory
 
01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:24.750 align:start position:0%
we have the the nuclear Regulatory
Commission

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
federally uh not the atomic energy
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
commission right that we no longer call
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
it that um and so some aspects of the
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
bill are just updating terminologies
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
just so we we don't seem like we're in
 
01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
the stone ages regarding this uh
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
statute the second aspect and it's on
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
page three line 19 is a very uh it it's
 
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
very small but it it's a it packs a
 
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
punch that is to High our state statutes
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
to the federal definition of advanced
 
01:21:59.790 --> 01:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
nuclear and this was a recommendation
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
from uh Christine I'm GNA say her name
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
wrong but chis media Christine chis
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
media from the nuclear energy Institute
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
who was uh paying attention to our
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
meetings and she said that uh it's a
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
good idea to to Anchor your state
 
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
statutes to the federal definition of of
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
advanced atomic
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
energy and I print that out for you in
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
that in that three-page print out the
 
01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
last page has the federal definition
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
it's right in the middle of the page
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
there's a section definitions and it
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
says Advanced nuclear reactor so this
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
would tie our state statutes to that
 
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
definition and uh you know with any
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
amendments uh
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
occurring um excuse me Mr
 
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
chairman here over here Ms is is there a
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
handout because we haven't gotten it
 
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
down at this end
 
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
I've seen one handout it's um it's this
 
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
that's yeah that's the one I'm referring
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
to star cube uh I printed out starcube
 
01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not affiliated in any way with star
 
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
cube other than they paid attention to
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
our commission and it turns out and I'll
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
get to that in a moment but let me St
 
01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.590 align:start position:0%
get to that in a moment but let me St
track

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
here apparently it hasn't made its uh uh
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
I 20 copies to the rest of
 
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.910 align:start position:0%
I 20 copies to the rest of
us

01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
statute yeah there's two two and there
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
was a and there was a letter yes
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
correct I'm pretty sure everybody got
 
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
the letter but not everybody got
 
01:23:47.709 --> 01:23:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
162b thank you and I'm sorry I
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
interrupted it's okay that's all right
 
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
all right representative Ammon continue
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
please okay so first first thing the
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
bill does is update some outdated
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
definitions or uh terminology actually
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
second thing it does is ties our state
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
statutes to the federal definition of
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear and I printed all that
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
out for you and then the last thing it
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
does is this atomic energy coordinator
 
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
position that was supposed to be
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
appointed and advised the governing
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
Council and the governor and it hasn't
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
been filled so it takes that it sort of
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
resurrect that position because it's
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
already in statute puts it under the
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
opes of the Department of energy uh and
 
01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
then it requires the department of
 
01:24:33.149 --> 01:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
energy to sort of be be the appoint
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
someone to be the
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
coordinator and it gives uh because
 
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
there's there were no deadlines I think
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
that that might be why the statute was
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
being ignored so I put a deadline in
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
there of five years uh that the report
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
would be issued once every five years
 
01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:51.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm that that can uh that was just
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
an arbitrary number number if it makes
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
sense to make that something different
 
01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm open to that um I had a thought
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
since filing that the uh Department of
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
energy does issue the 10-year energy
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
plan document that's quite extensive and
 
01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
they're required to do that once every
 
01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
three years so maybe it makes sense to
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
sort of make that part of the package of
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
of that but I'll leave that up to the
 
01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.470 align:start position:0%
of that but I'll leave that up to the
committee

01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
um so Advanced nuclear uh it's on the
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
horizon it might be distantly on the
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
horizon depending on uh which which news
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh we get of the day uh we know that uh
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
new scale was a big hope in Utah uh and
 
01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.189 align:start position:0%
new scale was a big hope in Utah uh and
that

01:25:32.189 --> 01:25:32.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
recently uh that that project fell apart
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
new scale is continuing on as as a
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
company um I believe that this
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
technology is going to come it's going
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
to be it's going to be clean it's going
 
01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:49.119 align:start position:0%
to be firm power uh and it's going to be
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh scalable where it can be one
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
megawatts all the way up to 300
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
megawatts there are currently something
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
like 42 different companies currently
 
01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
working in the advanced nuclear space
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
they have hired something like 14,000
 
01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
employees and they're spending in the
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
order of9 billion dollar developing
 
01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear um Westinghouse is one
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
of the companies and we know
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
Westinghouse has a manufacturing
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
facility in New Hampshire in Newington
 
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they actually manufacture
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
components for nuclear reactors um so I
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
won't dive into the study commission
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
report because I'll leave copies for you
 
01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
in the room um but you can see that
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's opportunity here for our
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
state to be uh sort of on the Leading
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
Edge of advanced nuclear and this bill
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
is not very ambitious it's kind of a
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
little bit of a housekeeping bill um but
 
01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
it is to like move the ball forward and
 
01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
and let you know uh make sure that our
 
01:26:54.669 --> 01:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
state and its departments are paying
 
01:26:57.229 --> 01:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
attention to to this
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
development I think that's all I have oh
 
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
one more thing uh we we found out about
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
this company Manchester based company
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
called starcube I printed out their I
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
think I think this was emailed to you
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
and I was cced on it I think that's how
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
I got it yes it was um they were hoping
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
to be here today but the weather uh kept
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
them from coming and I think they have
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
additional comments that they'd like to
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
present but this is an example of
 
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know instate
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
development uh in this industry and uh
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
it it's something I think this committee
 
01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know would would do well to pay
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you happy to take any questions
 
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you questions for the
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative representative Corman has
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon uh for that
 
01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:49.639 align:start position:0%
presentation um I have to confess I was
 
01:27:52.270 --> 01:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
a little too lazy to look up us codes
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
16271 B1 about Advanced nuclear reactors
 
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
I printed it out for you if you have it
 
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
in front of you you did yep and there
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
are copies coming okay there's the last
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
page of that packet has it um oh I see
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
it in the middle of the page there's
 
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
those definitions it's right below that
 
01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:10.149 align:start position:0%
those definitions it's right below that
okay

01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
yeah in that case um I don't have a
 
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
question all right so what was your
 
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
question would it would have been um can
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
you uh give us a brief description of an
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
reactor yeah um the definition is the
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
best way to to deal with it but um an
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear reactor um so there's
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
something called generation three
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
reactors which is what this is going to
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
take a while which is what seab Brook is
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
right it's a it's a light Water Reactor
 
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
um but there are Advanced versions of
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
that they're they're called Generation 3
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
plus and one of the big Innovations is
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
they have safety features that prevent
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
vent uh meltdown and the absence of all
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
power failure so Generation 3 plus um
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
Westinghouse has one that's based on the
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
the same design that vogle is but it's
 
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
much smaller 300 megawatts and then
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
generation four are Rea Advanced
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
reactors that have uh they use something
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
called Trio fuel which is like a like a
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
pebble or like a billiard ball a whole
 
01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:20.199 align:start position:0%
bunch of them that they're bathed in gas
 
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
usually helium and the gas is the the
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
conduit for uh the heat exchange um
 
01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
that's one it could also be molten salt
 
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
instead of helium um and these are also
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
very safe that if all the power if
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
something like Fukushima happened where
 
01:29:38.669 --> 01:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
the generators that were required to
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
keep it running got flooded with water
 
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
and couldn't operate that the system
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
would shut down very safely into a
 
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
dormant State and that's uh that's one
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
of the the the uh inherit uh features
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative muns
 
01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:56.390 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative muns
has

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill
 
01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
um qu question for you um currently and
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
and I think the way you're envisioning
 
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
this moving forward is that each of
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
these individual departments produces
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
report um would you what what what are
 
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on instead of having them
 
01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
each produce an individual report have
 
01:30:21.159 --> 01:30:22.430 align:start position:0%
each produce an individual report have
Doe

01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
Doe
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
kind of get get input from each of them
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
report yeah I I think that's pretty much
 
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
how it's that's the way I understand it
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and again this is existing statute
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to already be being
 
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
done and and it hasn't been for a while
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
so I would see I would Envision instead
 
01:30:47.149 --> 01:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
of the atomic coordinator the atomic
 
01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
activities coordinator that that would
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
be a position in in the doe and they
 
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
would coordinate just like they were you
 
01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
know it was supposed to back in the day
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh with all those other departments
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
because atomic energy does touch many
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
different aspects it touches the labor
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
force it touches Supply chains it
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
touches Transportation it touches
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
Insurance it touches Health and Human
 
01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
Services the environment right so uh
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
those departments would be uh you know
 
01:31:19.709 --> 01:31:19.719 align:start position:0%
consulted with for the report generation
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
follow followup followup
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that answer but I I
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
guess what I was suggesting and I just
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to get your thought your reaction
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
was changing the statute so that it says
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be a single report
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
produced by the coordinator okay with
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
input from yeah those other departments
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm open to that uh to make it
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
explicit that would be fine okay yeah
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative liwicki has a
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
question um thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
you representative um is there a
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
realistic path forward for New Hampshire
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
to actually have more nuclear
 
01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
generation a realistic
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
path um yes but I think it's going to
 
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
take time just because uh the the
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
industry moves very
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
slowly um the path would be would
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
require private
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
Capital uh to come in and to to back
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
stop uh development because we're not a
 
01:32:18.669 --> 01:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
we're not a a vertically integrated
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
Market representative Harrington can
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
tell you were a uh you know deregulated
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
Market um but that private capital is
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
out there there there's billions of
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
dollars being invested in this industry
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
right now um and so if our state is
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
welcoming to the industry and our
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
Regulators are knowledgeable and paying
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
attention to it uh that's where that
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
Capital would pay attention it it
 
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
currently is um so with our commission
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
we've pretty much touched a lot of these
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
different manufacturers they're all
 
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
aware that New Hampshire is paying
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
attention to this industry so that's how
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
I would see it playing out is the the
 
01:32:59.070 --> 01:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
funding of it
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
um there are other recommendations in
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
the report that I won't get into
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
but representative Thomas has a question
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um on the bottom of
 
01:33:13.709 --> 01:33:13.719 align:start position:0%
page one going on to page two you talk
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
about um a person needs to obtain a
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
license or permit from the United States
 
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
nuclear Regulatory Commission
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
um to engage in activities um how do you
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
know how easy or difficult it is to
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
obtain such a license and are we going
 
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
to see a prolifer a proliferation of
 
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.310 align:start position:0%
to see a prolifer a proliferation of
backyard

01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:39.270 align:start position:0%
backyard
nuclear

01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
nuclear
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
devices yeah
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
um one can only dream that we'd all have
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
a nuclear reactor in our backyard um so
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
the the bill language that you just
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
cited is existing law the only change
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
the bill makes is it changes it from the
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
atomic energy commission to the nuclear
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission so that's already
 
01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
existing law okay um and uh and again
 
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to representative Harrington
 
01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
he's an expert in this field but the NRC
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
is looking to uh create uh regulatory um
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework for advanced
 
01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
nuclear and I think I think new scale uh
 
01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
was actually licensed by the NRC that
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
was one of the the the hopeful uh you
 
01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
know events that that happened in that
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
regard okay thank you representative
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington has a question yeah thank you
 
01:34:27.870 --> 01:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm I'm
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
I understand the uh housekeeping aspect
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
of the bill but is it is this going to
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
be uh other duties as assigned or is it
 
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a new position as this
 
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
coordinator because I mean realistically
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know when I hear the uh head of uh
 
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
dup power's nuclear division say they
 
01:34:49.229 --> 01:34:49.239 align:start position:0%
want to put in maybe 10 gaw of nuclear
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
but they don't expect to build anything
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
for five to 10 years because they don't
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
want to be first they're a vertically
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
integrated utility that has a big
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
nuclear Fleet why would anybody come to
 
01:35:02.910 --> 01:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the future within the
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
next 5 to 10 years so will we pretty
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
mature with this yeah so the bill it's a
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
5-year cycle so previously these reports
 
01:35:13.149 --> 01:35:13.159 align:start position:0%
were supposed to be issued I think by
 
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
anually that that was uh the original
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
that that's existing statute so this uh
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
puts it out once every five years I
 
01:35:21.199 --> 01:35:22.310 align:start position:0%
puts it out once every five years I
think

01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh some kind of frequency like that once
 
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
every five years where we're paying
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
attention to an industry that we know is
 
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's Fe it's a feasible
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
industry it's just the regulation uh
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
aspect is what's kind of slowing it down
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
and we know that I mean we've heard from
 
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
the dep Department of energy they they
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
actually came to our commission that
 
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
there's a big push for advanced nuclear
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
currently at the federal level so you
 
01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
know this is just my imagination but the
 
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
way I would see it playing out is the
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
first of a kind reac actors will
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
probably probably be built in South
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
Korea or in Poland right and that'll
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
prove the design uh for you know anth of
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
a Kind which is really what we would
 
01:36:04.750 --> 01:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
need to get to for New Hampshire to uh
 
01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
for it to be Fe feasible in New
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um just to follow up I just
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
when you follow
 
01:36:13.950 --> 01:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
up the I just want to get the intent of
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
the bill is not to create a new position
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
but it would be somebody that's already
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
in the department of energy and it would
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
be other d as assigned and this would be
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
their other
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
duties that's the way I would I would
 
01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:27.159 align:start position:0%
see it I I'll leave it up to the
 
01:36:29.229 --> 01:36:29.239 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to to you know
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
maybe this needs to be tweaked um but
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
what I don't want to have happen is a
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
statute that everyone's ignoring about
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
the subject right like let's let's
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
repeal the statute if we're not going to
 
01:36:41.310 --> 01:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
do anything else right um but I think it
 
01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense to sort of you know breathe
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
some new life into this and uh you know
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
this is my first attempt and it's the
 
01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:51.639 align:start position:0%
committee's bill at this point so all
 
01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
right so let's talk about the elephant
 
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
in the room and that is the fiscal note
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
which says that this bill will cost
 
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars to
 
01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
implement the changes in this bill
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
because of all the new positions that
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
that will be required do you think those
 
01:37:10.350 --> 01:37:10.360 align:start position:0%
estimates are realistic I you know can I
 
01:37:12.189 --> 01:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
uh can we like laser focus in on one of
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
them because I almost fell out my chair
 
01:37:18.109 --> 01:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
when I read it um the the Department of
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs their
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was way outside what the
 
01:37:25.149 --> 01:37:25.159 align:start position:0%
other departments were saying um they
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
want a whole new position
 
01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
so the Department of Business and
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs would play a cameo role
 
01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
in this once every fiveyear report
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
right how would you require a new
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
position that gets paid it was 120
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
$121,000 wor benefits every year so that
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
you could
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
participate with you know a few pages in
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
the report you know I'm not trying to
 
01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
diminish the the position of the
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
department but I I think that one fiscal
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
note there is way outside the norm the
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
other departments mainly said that they
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
can handle it with existing resources
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
the department of energy of course would
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
have the most responsibility and uh I I
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
would pay attention more to their their
 
01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:10.870 align:start position:0%
would pay attention more to their their
needs

01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
than hiring a new employee at 121,000 a
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
year so okay good thank you rep Vice
 
01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas has a question thank you Mr
 
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:21.790 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
um

01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
I assumed since this was a
 
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the commission that
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
everybody on the commission was in favor
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
of this bill or of of what you submitted
 
01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so the report was was unanimous um
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
and uh this was one of the
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations in the report so so so
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
my question basically is if we just if
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
we do this bill there might be some
 
01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
tweaking required but if we do this bill
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
which is basically to do what we should
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
have been doing all along yeah um it
 
01:38:51.629 --> 01:38:51.639 align:start position:0%
seems to me that that it would
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
um bring to light the proper education
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
that would be needed within the state
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore the general public as to
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
the the the benefits of looking in the
 
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
far future of what the new type of
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy could be is is this is
 
01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
this what the intent of of this bill
 
01:39:14.669 --> 01:39:14.679 align:start position:0%
would bring to the table a a a new
 
01:39:17.589 --> 01:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
education to get rid of the old obsolete
 
01:39:20.109 --> 01:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
um idea that that nuclear is bad but
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
that the new technology is actually good
 
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's the cleanest form we have for for
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
sustainable type energy is would that be
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
intent would that intent be met by this
 
01:39:32.189 --> 01:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
bill I believe so I believe so that's
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh again it's it's existing statute
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
that's being ignored so we should do
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
something and I this was my my best
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
attempt at at uh you know kind of
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
keeping the ball rolling from our
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
commission so representative muns has a
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
question another question thank you Mr
 
01:39:49.629 --> 01:39:49.639 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my second
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
question um other other than adding the
 
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
definition of advanced nuclear
 
01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:57.229 align:start position:0%
definition of advanced nuclear
reactor

01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
reactor
 
01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't see any place in the
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
bill where it you know talks about or
 
01:40:06.189 --> 01:40:06.199 align:start position:0%
directs the state agencies to to
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
specifically look at that technology am
 
01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
I am I missing something uh just give me
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
one minute and I'll I'll try to find the
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.629 --> 01:40:21.639 align:start position:0%
question I I guess while you're doing it
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
as a followup or is it just the the hope
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
that they will look at
 
01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
look it should be assigned to the
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
aren't so my reading of this is on page
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
two line 8 each of the following
 
01:40:50.350 --> 01:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
departments and agencies of the state
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
government is directed to initiate and
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
to pursue continuing studies as to the
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
need if any for changes in the laws
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
administrative rules administered by it
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
that would arise from the presence blah
 
01:41:06.189 --> 01:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
blah blah is that
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
basically what you're directing I'm
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
having trouble finding it and I
 
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
apologize but the intent was to put that
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
to add that to the duties of the
 
01:41:17.229 --> 01:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and maybe
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
there's it was such a simple change that
 
01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
maybe I missed it but just a
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
clarification I mean I was I was I was
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
asking if there's if there's anything in
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
the bill that specifically says that
 
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.109 align:start position:0%
the bill that specifically says that
advanced

01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
advanced
 
01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
nuclear um reactors should be looked
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
at and I'm trying to find the answer so
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
in the in the draft that I sent to OS it
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
had the department of energy would have
 
01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
that particular responsibility not not
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily the under the other
 
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
departments I'm just having trouble
 
01:41:53.149 --> 01:41:53.159 align:start position:0%
finding it and uh I found it you sorry
 
01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
yep line page two line 18 new paragraph
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
continuing studies Department of energy
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear reactors there we go my
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
apologies so I wasn't uh blowing hot air
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you all right additional
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee has one
 
01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um representative Ammon
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and for putting
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
forth the bill I think it's a it's a
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
good idea um on the amount here that
 
01:42:22.109 --> 01:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
that uh the Department of Business and
 
01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs is putting in here I
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
think maybe they're assuming that they
 
01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
have to hire somebody that has a little
 
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
bit of experience in order to contribute
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
the part that they might need to
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
contribute because you're you're asking
 
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
for a fairly comprehensive look right so
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
these people are going to have to know
 
01:42:40.589 --> 01:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
something yeah I would think about the
 
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
industry could
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
be um and maybe they're resource
 
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
strapped because uh they had a seat on
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
the study commission and and and didn't
 
01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
participate so oh that's yeah that's
 
01:42:55.950 --> 01:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
common yeah so whatever we give them as
 
01:42:59.229 --> 01:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
a suggestion I guess but um in current
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
statute the the the Department of
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs is already
 
01:43:06.589 --> 01:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
listed as having this responsibility
 
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
so um they're already not doing
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
something they're supposed to be doing
 
01:43:13.629 --> 01:43:13.639 align:start position:0%
this just makes it a little more clear
 
01:43:13.639 --> 01:43:14.709 align:start position:0%
this just makes it a little more clear
follow

01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
up yes follow up so it it appears that
 
01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:21.639 align:start position:0%
you want to um resuscitate this Statute
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
in order to address a gap that you feel
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
exists in the state being able to speak
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
intelligently with the federal
 
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
government about whether we're going to
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
move forward with anything to do with
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
Advanced reactor technology here in the
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
state is that correct and we don't have
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere to start because there's no
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
point there's no point person yeah
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no grounding in
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
statute for that whole subject area you
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
know Loosely maybe under atomic energy
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
but but the specifically this Advanced
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
reactor devel so do you foresee the
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
state doe being being the point in terms
 
01:43:54.189 --> 01:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
of that inter that conversation or that
 
01:43:56.589 --> 01:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
interaction yes that's how it's written
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
you I'm trying to figure out if this is
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
an early bill or not oh
 
01:44:09.629 --> 01:44:09.639 align:start position:0%
yeah if it is it's going to go
 
01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
to house finance it is an early bill
 
01:44:16.109 --> 01:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
it's due out the 15th of February so
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
this will be going to house finance so
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
my next question for you then would be
 
01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
how are you going to
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
justify the expenditures in this bill
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
before house
 
01:44:30.990 --> 01:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
finance I'd like to hear uh the from the
 
01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
business of economic uh Affairs how they
 
01:44:38.669 --> 01:44:38.679 align:start position:0%
justify hiring a whole new person for
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
that position maybe we can clarify the
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
language to make it clear that they
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
don't need to hire a nuclear expert to
 
01:44:47.709 --> 01:44:47.719 align:start position:0%
participate in a five-year study you
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
know once every five years
 
01:44:54.589 --> 01:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
so okay good additional questions for
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative Amin seeing none well
 
01:44:58.750 --> 01:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
next call on the department of energy
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
and uh Griffin Roberge to give us the
 
01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
Department's take on this proposed
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm going to leave these in
 
01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
the committee room I have to move on to
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
another appointment so I won't be able
 
01:45:11.790 --> 01:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
to stay but thank you yes thank you
 
01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:13.189 align:start position:0%
to stay but thank you yes thank you
appreciate

01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:32.910 align:start position:0%
 
robers

01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you members of the committee uh
 
01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
for the record Griffin Rober sty program
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
manager at the New Hampshire Department
 
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
of energy um the department is neutral
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
to this bill as introduced um as was
 
01:45:49.149 --> 01:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned um the bill revises
 
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
a section of state statute that has been
 
01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
in existence and has remained untouched
 
01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:54.870 align:start position:0%
in existence and has remained untouched
since

01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
1955 um working its way around the room
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
now is a letter of testimony from the
 
01:46:01.629 --> 01:46:01.639 align:start position:0%
Department with our observations on the
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
bill as has been mentioned um the bill
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
makes a number of changes but primarily
 
01:46:09.149 --> 01:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
from the Department's perspective it uh
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
requires the department and several
 
01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
other state agencies to uh conduct
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
continuing studies uh as to whether any
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
changes in State Statute or
 
01:46:19.629 --> 01:46:19.639 align:start position:0%
administrative rule are needed for
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
nuclear activity taking place in the
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
state and those agencies have to publish
 
01:46:26.189 --> 01:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
uh reports on their continuing studies
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
no later than December 1 to
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
25 um it also requires a Department's
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner or Design Within the
 
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
department to serve as an advisor to the
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
governor on nuclear energy and to serve
 
01:46:39.550 --> 01:46:39.560 align:start position:0%
as a coordinator of nuclear development
 
01:46:42.109 --> 01:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
activities um this involves a number of
 
01:46:43.709 --> 01:46:43.719 align:start position:0%
different responsibilities such as
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
coordinating with the Department of
 
01:46:47.790 --> 01:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
Business and of economic Affairs and
 
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
coordinate and uh collecting and I guess
 
01:46:52.030 --> 01:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
gu um summarizing a lot of the
 
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
coordinating studies being put together
 
01:46:55.709 --> 01:46:55.719 align:start position:0%
by the other state agencies and then
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
finally it requires the coordinator to
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
be fully informed of all activities
 
01:47:02.669 --> 01:47:02.679 align:start position:0%
undertaken um by other state agencies on
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy matters it also makes
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
clear that no administrative rule
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
specifically applying to a nuclear
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
energy matter shall be adopted unless
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
and until it has been submitted to the
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
coordinator that would be placed in our
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
department um as far as the Bill's
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
impact on the department um the
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
department is also tasked with uh
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill on page two um
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
the department as well as the Public
 
01:47:34.109 --> 01:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission must particularly
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
study the transportation of special
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
nuclear materials and byproduct
 
01:47:41.870 --> 01:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
materials by Common carriers or public
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
or private air carriers that are not
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
involved in interstate commerce and the
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
participation of Public Utilities
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
they're subject to the state's
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in projects look looking to
 
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
the development of uh nuclear facilities
 
01:47:58.709 --> 01:47:58.719 align:start position:0%
for industrial or commercial use um by
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
way of background um the establishment
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
of this position as has been mentioned
 
01:48:05.229 --> 01:48:05.239 align:start position:0%
was a recommendation from the uh
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
commission to investigate the
 
01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:08.679 align:start position:0%
implementation of Next Generation
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactor technology in New
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which was created by House
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 543 um two years ago the department
 
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
is unaware if the coordinator's duties
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
are currently being fulfilled by another
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
state agency but I think the prime
 
01:48:23.589 --> 01:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor pre uh previously indicated he
 
01:48:25.589 --> 01:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
had looked into that and nobody's
 
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
currently doing that um the department
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
could absorb the duties um of this bill
 
01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
by creating a new position and
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
repurposing some existing federal funds
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
for this position however we do want to
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
note that the department would have to
 
01:48:42.430 --> 01:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
reduce some programmatic activities that
 
01:48:44.350 --> 01:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
it currently undertakes with those funds
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
to fund this position on a continuing
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
basis um and additionally for background
 
01:48:50.910 --> 01:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
I did want to note that department does
 
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
not have any sizable regulatory role
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
over energy generation but the
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
legislature has in the past created new
 
01:48:59.310 --> 01:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
positions to look at specific energy
 
01:49:02.109 --> 01:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
generation resources um for example we
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
do have an office of offshore wind
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
industry development that was created um
 
01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
in recent years and that is funded under
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
the state's renewable energy fund under
 
01:49:14.430 --> 01:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard um with
 
01:49:16.350 --> 01:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
that happy to take any questions that
 
01:49:20.189 --> 01:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
folks might have thank you thank you
 
01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here and giving us
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
your perspective on this legislation I
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
have a quick question for you the way I
 
01:49:30.189 --> 01:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
read the existing statute that the bill
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
modifies the only thing
 
01:49:36.189 --> 01:49:36.199 align:start position:0%
that state departments or state agencies
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
are required to do is submit a report
 
01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
occasionally about what legal statutory
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
changes might need to be made if
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
any so it's not asking anybody to study
 
01:49:55.390 --> 01:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
the nuclear in industry it's just simply
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
saying are there any statutory or
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
regulatory barriers that exist within
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
your department that you could report on
 
01:50:08.910 --> 01:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
isn't that essentially what's going on
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
here sure and thank you for the question
 
01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:13.719 align:start position:0%
I am I currently work for one Department
 
01:50:15.070 --> 01:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
I couldn't imagine working for multiple
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
ones so I cannot speak for uh the other
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
departments who are implicated in this
 
01:50:21.870 --> 01:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
business B um I think it would be
 
01:50:24.030 --> 01:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
helpful for the committee to look at in
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
its entirety um RSA 162b colon 3 which
 
01:50:31.950 --> 01:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
is the section that's being amended by
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
section two on page two specifically if
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
you look at line 17 on page two you're
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
going to see a colon at the end of that
 
01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
line that if it if if the bill had
 
01:50:44.589 --> 01:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
continued it would list out the duties
 
01:50:46.109 --> 01:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
that would be attached to each of the
 
01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
different state agencies so for example
 
01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
services to your point uh Mr chairman is
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
required to look at any potential uh
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
administrative rule or statutory changes
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh quote particularly as to hazards if
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
any to the public health and safety um
 
01:51:05.669 --> 01:51:05.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor particularly any
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
hazardous working conditions as to
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
whether any uh as to the time and
 
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
character of proof of of claims of
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
injuries in the extent of compensation
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
allowable therefore
 
01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
so the language is quite Broad in the in
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
the remainder of the statute so I I
 
01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
can't explain where
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
um where different agencies might be
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
coming from in terms of what they're
 
01:51:30.990 --> 01:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
asking for for administrative resources
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
to complete these continuing studies but
 
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
um you know the Pu and the department of
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
energy specifically have two things that
 
01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
we look at that we would be tasked with
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
looking into and then we'd have that
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
coordinator position kind of wrap all of
 
01:51:43.199 --> 01:51:44.629 align:start position:0%
coordinator position kind of wrap all of
this

01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
together representative Harrington has a
 
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um looking at
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
this and you say the law has been
 
01:51:55.470 --> 01:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
changed since 1955 yet since then we've
 
01:51:58.270 --> 01:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
built a nuclear plant in New Hampshire
 
01:51:59.790 --> 01:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
and that's been running uh for quite
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
some time now uh I wouldn't even care to
 
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
guess how many other people have a
 
01:52:06.750 --> 01:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
license from the NC to handle
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
radioactive material such as industrial
 
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
radiography uh uh who knows what um uh
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
so there's there ongoing nuclear
 
01:52:19.229 --> 01:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
activities in the state and obviously it
 
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
they're being done without any oversight
 
01:52:23.669 --> 01:52:23.679 align:start position:0%
from all this on this law because nobody
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
even knew it was around um so could this
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
be taken and just shrunk down to say
 
01:52:31.069 --> 01:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a coordinator a
 
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
person in the department of energy will
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
be the coordinator contact person for
 
01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire on any all
 
01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:39.639 align:start position:0%
nuclear issues and not assign things to
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
other departments which really have to
 
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
they'll do a study basically to show
 
01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing nothing uh and they could
 
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
really shrink this down and get rid of
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
all this uh fiscal note stuff and yet
 
01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
let people know like other states have
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
done that hey we're open for nuclear
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
power in New Hampshire and we hope you
 
01:52:58.510 --> 01:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
come here but uh all this regulatory
 
01:53:00.510 --> 01:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
stuff we don't have puc has got nothing
 
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
to do with it anymore anyways sure and
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
no I thank you for the question the
 
01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
observations I would just note that to
 
01:53:08.350 --> 01:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
the extent the committee wishes to
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
modify the remainder of the statute to
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
kind of consolidate the state agencies
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
who are involved in these studies I
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
would again as I referenced in my lay of
 
01:53:19.149 --> 01:53:19.159 align:start position:0%
testimony there is an office office of
 
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
offshore wind development that's in our
 
01:53:23.069 --> 01:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
office that's currently an existing
 
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
statute that may be a a good place to
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
maybe start as maybe a a place to May
 
01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
amendment represent Vice chair Thomas
 
01:53:36.030 --> 01:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh really
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
quick um by re by re revitalizing the
 
01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
statutes uh and if it still passes would
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
this have an effect on your uh on the
 
01:53:54.109 --> 01:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
state's uh 10-year energy plan in terms
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
of what goes in
 
01:53:57.790 --> 01:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
there uh thank you for the question so
 
01:53:59.870 --> 01:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
this bill does not specifically address
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
the statute as it pertains to um the
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
state's 10-year uh State energy strategy
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
um however I imagine you know um to the
 
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
extent nuclear technology becomes more
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
in the mainstream or becomes more
 
01:54:17.229 --> 01:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
developed in later years um I imagine
 
01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
our strategy will likely have some
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
discussion on nuclear power for example
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
the recent one um has a short write up
 
01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
of uh Seabrook and its uh usage in the
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
state follow up uh yes thank you uh I
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
guess what I I meant to ask was do you
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
see perhaps a need in this bill or
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
whatever it comes out as to um I don't
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
like to use the word mandate but to
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
require that the reports that this bill
 
01:54:50.430 --> 01:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
um is is citing
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh would be would be used in the
 
01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
development of your 10year energy plan
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank so it's not a it's not a mandate
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
now under State Statute if that is
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature wanted to
 
01:55:06.069 --> 01:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
change it's certainly free to do so but
 
01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
like I said we do we do make uh we do
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
make an effort in our strategy right now
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
to discuss nuclear power in the state of
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the
 
01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
strategy representative Kaplan has a
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr robar for coming in sure um you
 
01:55:24.030 --> 01:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
say that the department of energy could
 
01:55:26.069 --> 01:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
meet at Staffing these by repurposing
 
01:55:28.069 --> 01:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
some federal funds yes and therefore you
 
01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
might have to curtail some programmatic
 
01:55:31.229 --> 01:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
activities that are already being
 
01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
undertaken can you be more specific
 
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
about what those programmatic activities
 
01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
might be have those decisions been made
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
or what what do you foresee happening
 
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
with that sure so ideally the federal
 
01:55:44.109 --> 01:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
funds that we would use if this became
 
01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
law um that we would likely repurpose
 
01:55:49.390 --> 01:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
include uh State energy program dollars
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh that we receive from the US
 
01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
Department of energy that is typically a
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
annual Federal grant that all states
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
receive that varies based on federal
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
Appropriations every year but typically
 
01:56:03.310 --> 01:56:03.320 align:start position:0%
it's within the range of $450 to
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
$500,000 a year um that currently now is
 
01:56:09.550 --> 01:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
used to pay for uh the person sitting
 
01:56:12.149 --> 01:56:12.159 align:start position:0%
before you um as well as other
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
programmatic aspects such as um anou a
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding that we
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
currently have with the Department of
 
01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
administrative services for
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency projects and state
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
owned facilities um we also use it to
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
run a one-time competitive grant program
 
01:56:30.910 --> 01:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
every year called the seed grant program
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
it is um it's an acronym but um it is a
 
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
competitive grant program to public
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
schools for Energy Efficiency projects
 
01:56:45.790 --> 01:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:48.750 --> 01:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
2018 okay seeing no more questions I'd
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
like to thank you for being here this
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
morning Mr Roberge and with that I'm
 
01:56:55.069 --> 01:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on
 
01:56:57.069 --> 01:56:57.079 align:start position:0%

and in four minutes I will start a new
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
public hearing so if you need to take a
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.400 --> 02:02:01.870 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:02:01.870 --> 02:02:01.880 align:start position:0%

your seats so that we can move on
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
here we
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
have another uh piece of legislation I'd
 
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
like to open a public hearing on House
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 1508 requiring fiber optic op IC
 
02:02:21.310 --> 02:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
Communication service providers to
 
02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
prioritize service restoration for
 
02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and public health
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
organizations and I'd like to call on
 
02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
the Bill's Prime sponsor representative

mamia to introduce this legislation good
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.790 --> 02:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
welcome please turn on your mic thank
 
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
you good morning Mr chairman and
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee I am
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative Lind
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
mamea excuse
 
02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
me and I represent the town uh Grafton
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
district one uh which is North
 
02:03:05.229 --> 02:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
Country um I brought this bill
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
forward to uh House Bill
 
02:03:14.589 --> 02:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:17.800 align:start position:0%
prioritizing when there is a disruption
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
in services
 
02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
um of prioritizing public health and
 
02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:26.229 align:start position:0%
um of prioritizing public health and
safety

02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
organizations this bill came about
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.589 --> 02:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
happened excuse me that happened in
 
02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
Littleton and the chief of police is
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
here to describe this tell you what
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
happened and also to answer any
 
02:03:46.189 --> 02:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
questions regarding that
 
02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
incident um the bill I know it has some
 
02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
issues as far as the broadness of its
 
02:03:55.589 --> 02:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
language and stuff like that but where
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
the North Country depends a lot on fiber
 
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
optics um I thought this was a timely
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
bill um as I said chief of police uh
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
Paul Smith will be uh presenting and um
 
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
he will answer any questions I hope you
 
02:04:16.350 --> 02:04:16.360 align:start position:0%
will consider maybe putting this into an
 
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
interim study to debate the uh Merit of
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%

02:04:29.950 --> 02:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
hear from Mr Smith so um seeing no
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative mameo thank
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%

02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
bill and Mr Smith
 
02:04:40.189 --> 02:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
please give us your perspective on this
 
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
proposed legislative
 
02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
change and welcome to st&amp; thank you for
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
the committee to uh allow me to just
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
give you a little perspective uh as to
 
02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
kind of an uphill battle that we add we
 
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
have to address um uh certainly in the
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
North country but I I would say that um
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of Public Safety organizations uh
 
02:05:15.390 --> 02:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
um don't want to have to deal with the
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
the circumstances that I dealt with
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
concerning um f for Optics um as
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
technology advanced um things there was
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
there is a lot more um emphasis on fiber
 
02:05:31.069 --> 02:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
optics and how uh we utilize it in
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
public safety for example uh I use our
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
fiber optics um for our voice over IP
 
02:05:37.679 --> 02:05:38.709 align:start position:0%
fiber optics um for our voice over IP
telephone

02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
telephone
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
Communications uh we definitely use um
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh the internet fiber optics um for
 
02:05:46.990 --> 02:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
obtaining warrants search warrants some
 
02:05:49.510 --> 02:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
of those have to be emergency warrants
 
02:05:53.549 --> 02:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
uh we use it for um all of our evidence
 
02:05:56.109 --> 02:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
written evidence photographic evidence
 
02:05:58.990 --> 02:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's all uploaded into a cloud our
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
records management is in a cloud um and
 
02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:04.830 align:start position:0%
records management is in a cloud um and
also

02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
um our security our cameras our body
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
cameras all the things that we do we
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
rely on fiber optics to have these
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
things uploaded and stored and to have
 
02:06:19.149 --> 02:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
access to it so
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
on May 12th uh we were notified by uh
 
02:06:25.069 --> 02:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
secured Network Services that and this
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
is I'm sorry
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
2023 um that they were going to change
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
their site that they were they were they
 
02:06:33.149 --> 02:06:33.159 align:start position:0%
had to locate they're going to relocate
 
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
and um they advised us that we had to
 
02:06:39.709 --> 02:06:39.719 align:start position:0%
contact our fiber optic uh provider um
 
02:06:41.470 --> 02:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
to move their equipment to the new
 
02:06:43.709 --> 02:06:43.719 align:start position:0%
location so there'd be a smooth
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
transition uh this wouldn't be taking
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
place until
 
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
July so we we believe we gave him ample
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
notification we did notify him on May
 
02:06:54.750 --> 02:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
15th we called them uh regarding this
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
matter and they were and uh we were
 
02:06:59.709 --> 02:06:59.719 align:start position:0%
instructed to send a copy of the letter
 
02:07:01.709 --> 02:07:01.719 align:start position:0%
of my request to their C customer
 
02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
service um Department which we did the
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
email was sent and received uh on the
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
19th of July uh scared Network Services
 
02:07:14.109 --> 02:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
contacted us to follow up on the status
 
02:07:15.629 --> 02:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
of the equipment that needed to be
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
changed and uh for the move and because
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
had not heard um or seen anybody from
 
02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
our uh fiber optics provider and they
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
were scheduled to be um out at their new
 
02:07:32.669 --> 02:07:32.679 align:start position:0%
location on July 31st uh on July
 
02:07:36.069 --> 02:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
26 and by the way at that point uh our
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
administrative Department contacted the
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
um uh the fiber optics uh provider um
 
02:07:47.310 --> 02:07:47.320 align:start position:0%
and we were asking about the initial
 
02:07:49.229 --> 02:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
email uh
 
02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:51.719 align:start position:0%
and requesting service relocation to the
 
02:07:53.629 --> 02:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
different email address obviously the
 
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
the new address that the secur Network
 
02:07:59.310 --> 02:07:59.320 align:start position:0%
Services had um and it was determined
 
02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
that our initial email was sent to
 
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
incorrect person not our fault it was
 
02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
within the fiber optics company uh and
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh it was assigned to the wrong account
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
so it was an administrative error on
 
02:08:15.069 --> 02:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
their behalf we said fine however you
 
02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
need to move your equipment by the 31st
 
02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
of July because
 
02:08:21.950 --> 02:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
we we need our fiber optics to operate
 
02:08:25.229 --> 02:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
efficient efficiently for Public Safety
 
02:08:28.430 --> 02:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
um on the 26 we received another email
 
02:08:30.910 --> 02:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
from the fiber optic optic company
 
02:08:34.189 --> 02:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
requesting us to sign a document to
 
02:08:38.549 --> 02:08:38.559 align:start position:0%
initiate this project so we did um
 
02:08:40.750 --> 02:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's how things happen
 
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
in U in the the commercial world right
 
02:08:46.109 --> 02:08:46.119 align:start position:0%
and you know you get a sign and you have
 
02:08:50.669 --> 02:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:53.709 --> 02:08:53.719 align:start position:0%
resources again July 31st was our drop
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
dead date where we lose our fiber
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
connection I in uh like I instructed
 
02:09:00.589 --> 02:09:00.599 align:start position:0%
earlier or informed you earlier we have
 
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of resources specifically our
 
02:09:05.149 --> 02:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
telephone Communications that depend on
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
the fiber optics um we received an
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
introductory email on the 31st from the
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh project manager from the fiber optic
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
company stating that they would move
 
02:09:19.629 --> 02:09:19.639 align:start position:0%
their equipment on the day that it was
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
already supposed to be moved uh on the
 
02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
30 on the 1st of August we lost our
 
02:09:28.270 --> 02:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
internet connection uh and uh we began
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh operating off of our redundant system
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
which is Wireless uh it just does not
 
02:09:36.030 --> 02:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
have the capacity of all the things that
 
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
we certainly need video and audio
 
02:09:42.270 --> 02:09:42.280 align:start position:0%
capabilities to upload and download um
 
02:09:45.149 --> 02:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
as a result we lost numerous phone calls
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
um into our administrative and into the
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
police department
 
02:09:51.390 --> 02:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
um also received an email from the
 
02:09:53.149 --> 02:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
project manager stating there wasn't
 
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
enough capacity utilizing the current
 
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
equipment at their new location um so
 
02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:02.189 align:start position:0%
equipment at their new location um so
um

02:10:02.189 --> 02:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:05.069 --> 02:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
they uh attached was a firm order of
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
commitment for us to review so basically
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
they didn't they didn't have the
 
02:10:12.510 --> 02:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
capacity and Personnel uh
 
02:10:17.069 --> 02:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
so um the fiber optics um people
 
02:10:20.669 --> 02:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
scheduled a date which was 911
 
02:10:24.549 --> 02:10:24.559 align:start position:0%
2023 um to basically initiate their
 
02:10:26.750 --> 02:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
project so they were going to made us
 
02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:29.599 align:start position:0%
make us wait from August 1st until
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
September 11th to finalize the project
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
for our fiber optics
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
Communications um on the second we spoke
 
02:10:39.390 --> 02:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
to the project manager and explained our
 
02:10:42.310 --> 02:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
situation directly uh and asked them to
 
02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
expedite the movement of their equipment
 
02:10:48.589 --> 02:10:48.599 align:start position:0%
um on the 8th I received an email from
 
02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
the project manager advising there would
 
02:10:53.549 --> 02:10:53.559 align:start position:0%
be they would be Expediting so now um it
 
02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
took them 6 days to send us an email to
 
02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
say that they would expedite the project
 
02:11:01.069 --> 02:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
and then finally on the 9th um uh we
 
02:11:03.310 --> 02:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
were able to we received communication
 
02:11:06.109 --> 02:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
that somebody would be at um our
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
location in Littleton and um the fiber
 
02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
was restored on the 9th of uh
 
02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:15.629 align:start position:0%
was restored on the 9th of uh
August

02:11:15.629 --> 02:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
August
 
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
so the impact of this particular
 
02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
incident I think is pretty broad meaning
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
I made numerous phone calls specifically
 
02:11:29.189 --> 02:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
to the um pu and I said hey you know is
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
there any way that you guys can step in
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
I assume that you regulate fiber and
 
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
help with this particular situation
 
02:11:40.910 --> 02:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
because so many public safety and
 
02:11:44.109 --> 02:11:44.119 align:start position:0%
Hospital uh entities rely on fiber
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
optics these days to communicate and to
 
02:11:49.149 --> 02:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
provide Public Health health and Public
 
02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
Safety uh the answer was no and I was
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
astonished by that because pu does
 
02:11:56.549 --> 02:11:56.559 align:start position:0%
regulate many things but fiber is not
 
02:11:58.229 --> 02:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
one of them I do know that the federal
 
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
government has its U grip on uh fiber
 
02:12:04.109 --> 02:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
optics as well however as you know
 
02:12:07.149 --> 02:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
they're very slow to respond so uh I
 
02:12:10.229 --> 02:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
contacted my uh representative uh and
 
02:12:14.350 --> 02:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
asked what can we do to at least
 
02:12:17.669 --> 02:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
prioritize um the response with fiber
 
02:12:17.679 --> 02:12:18.669 align:start position:0%
prioritize um the response with fiber
optics

02:12:18.669 --> 02:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
optics
 
02:12:23.149 --> 02:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh in situations such as ours with um
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and public health um not
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
every Police Department not every Fire
 
02:12:31.350 --> 02:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
Department Public Works Department and
 
02:12:33.549 --> 02:12:33.559 align:start position:0%
maybe even some small hospitals uh
 
02:12:36.189 --> 02:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
operate with redundancy they don't have
 
02:12:36.199 --> 02:12:37.149 align:start position:0%
operate with redundancy they don't have
that

02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
ability and the other options were that
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
the board of Selectmen uh just like with
 
02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
cable can have a contract with your
 
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
cable company and and say this is the
 
02:12:49.470 --> 02:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
way way we want things within our
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
community uh I think the citizens would
 
02:12:54.430 --> 02:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
be put at a disadvantage if you if you
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
basically say hey you know what you guys
 
02:12:58.109 --> 02:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
didn't respond properly so we're going
 
02:12:59.950 --> 02:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
to restrict your fiber optics in our
 
02:13:02.109 --> 02:13:02.119 align:start position:0%
community I don't think that's the best
 
02:13:03.790 --> 02:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
option and I also think that that's a
 
02:13:07.149 --> 02:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
slow response what we need is a uh
 
02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:09.599 align:start position:0%
within the Pu which is already
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
established entity the ability to have a
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
response to a failure with fiber optics
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
companies within the state of New
 
02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:18.589 align:start position:0%
companies within the state of New
Hampshire

02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:13:18.599 --> 02:13:21.430 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
thank

02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.430 --> 02:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
you well thank you chief for being here
 
02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
and outlining the situation that
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
happened with you folks up there in
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
Littleton I do have a quick question for
 
02:13:37.229 --> 02:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
you this bill talks specifically about
 
02:13:39.430 --> 02:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
fiber optic
 
02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
cables but aren't you basically talking
 
02:13:46.189 --> 02:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
about broadband support no I I used to
 
02:13:48.669 --> 02:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
think that too but broadband and fiber
 
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
are a little bit different fiber is a
 
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
lot faster so as our technology
 
02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
increases we have more Demand on um how
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
much information and how much video that
 
02:14:01.549 --> 02:14:01.559 align:start position:0%
for example we're downloading on our
 
02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
body cameras fiber is is the best option
 
02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
to get that information into the cloud
 
02:14:09.709 --> 02:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible or voice over IP
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
just that uh but Broadband is is a is a
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:19.790 --> 02:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
fiber so
 
02:14:22.549 --> 02:14:22.559 align:start position:0%
the fiber oit cable is the connection
 
02:14:23.709 --> 02:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
that gets you
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
to your internet
 
02:14:27.119 --> 02:14:28.790 align:start position:0%
to your internet
connection

02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
connection
 
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
yes so it's the internet connection that
 
02:14:33.390 --> 02:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
seems to be the problem here not the
 
02:14:35.910 --> 02:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
fiber optic
 
02:14:39.790 --> 02:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
cable the fiber optic company was
 
02:14:42.430 --> 02:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for the equipment that's a
 
02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
good question thank you uh for the
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
equipment that would relay the
 
02:14:49.549 --> 02:14:49.559 align:start position:0%
information that was being on their
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
fiber optic lines to our internet
 
02:14:56.350 --> 02:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
company okay uh we have quite a few
 
02:14:58.390 --> 02:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
people who want to have and I'm not an
 
02:15:00.910 --> 02:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
IT expert by the way so you may ask me
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
questions I can't we do have a couple of
 
02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
other people who are going to testify so
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll be able to ask some
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
technical questions but uh Vice chair
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
Thomas would like to ask you a question
 
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question really quick so my
 
02:15:16.990 --> 02:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is that in your efforts to
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
have those resolved
 
02:15:21.950 --> 02:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
there you found there there was no state
 
02:15:25.549 --> 02:15:25.559 align:start position:0%
agency or regulatory agency out there
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
that you could go to you were
 
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
effectively dealing strictly with the
 
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
fiber optic company per se you are
 
02:15:34.510 --> 02:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct and that there was no
 
02:15:36.189 --> 02:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
you had no contract that
 
02:15:38.589 --> 02:15:38.599 align:start position:0%
established any type of priority service
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
then I mean the contract didn't say
 
02:15:43.149 --> 02:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
anything about special services like
 
02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
that no
 
02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:46.790 align:start position:0%
that no
sir

02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
sir
 
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:48.870 align:start position:0%
sir
okay

02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:15:51.310 --> 02:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
02:15:52.549 --> 02:15:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh and thank you for taking
 
02:15:55.109 --> 02:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
my question um I I understand you're not
 
02:15:56.669 --> 02:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
an expert on this but you did make a
 
02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
statement I'm just trying to figure out
 
02:16:00.270 --> 02:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
if you was any research was done you did
 
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
the found out that the Pu was not does
 
02:16:05.229 --> 02:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
not have authority and in fact unless
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
something's changed the FCC has
 
02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
exclusive authority to regulate uh
 
02:16:13.229 --> 02:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
internet services and the state cannot
 
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
do it uh did you did something change
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
since I was on the commission and maybe
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh is there a change in federal law
 
02:16:22.030 --> 02:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is we couldn't
 
02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
regulate it if we wanted to unless
 
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
something's changed uh that wasn't the
 
02:16:27.910 --> 02:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
way it was explained to me that they had
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
exclusive Authority just that they did
 
02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:32.559 align:start position:0%
do the federal government did regulate
 
02:16:35.469 --> 02:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
uh although they were slow to respond um
 
02:16:38.349 --> 02:16:38.359 align:start position:0%
I just believed that for circumstances
 
02:16:40.629 --> 02:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
when it comes to Public Safety Public
 
02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
Health uh obviously State Control State
 
02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
ability to uh either and I don't have an
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
answer whether it's to fine or or I'm
 
02:16:52.830 --> 02:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
not a proponent of excessive
 
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
regulation um even though I am in the
 
02:16:56.990 --> 02:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement side of the house we
 
02:16:58.910 --> 02:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
know that we can't regulate our way out
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
of this but somebody or something within
 
02:17:03.870 --> 02:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire needs to hold
 
02:17:05.790 --> 02:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
uh their feet to the
 
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
fire representative Thomas has a
 
02:17:11.429 --> 02:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um I'm not
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
trying to belittle I'm not trying to um
 
02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
minimize I'm just trying to clarify
 
02:17:20.030 --> 02:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
based on what you've testified is this a
 
02:17:22.589 --> 02:17:22.599 align:start position:0%
customer service complaint with one
 
02:17:24.669 --> 02:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
company or is this a problem throughout
 
02:17:24.679 --> 02:17:26.549 align:start position:0%
company or is this a problem throughout
New

02:17:26.549 --> 02:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the the second question I
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
don't have enough data to to answer to
 
02:17:36.110 --> 02:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
answer that appropriately the first
 
02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:37.669 align:start position:0%
answer that appropriately the first
question

02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:17:42.429 --> 02:17:42.439 align:start position:0%
is um we have had similar issues with
 
02:17:46.110 --> 02:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
other companies that we contract with uh
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
in the past specific dealing with either
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
internet communications uh or
 
02:17:55.750 --> 02:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
telephone thank
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
you additional questions representative
 
02:18:00.389 --> 02:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Chief um the
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
language of the bill just basically says
 
02:18:06.709 --> 02:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
that the provider of communication
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
Services as described in
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
RSA um through fiber optic cable shall
 
02:18:15.070 --> 02:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
Upon A disruption of service prioritize
 
02:18:16.709 --> 02:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
the restoration of communication and
 
02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
internet access for critical
 
02:18:19.709 --> 02:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of Public Safety and
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
public health organizations and I would
 
02:18:24.429 --> 02:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
assume that might be a priority among
 
02:18:27.549 --> 02:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
them already um informally if it's not
 
02:18:30.509 --> 02:18:30.519 align:start position:0%
in statute so I'm wondering whether upon
 
02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:32.519 align:start position:0%
disruption of service would actually
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
have taken care of the category of
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
disruption that you uh you were looking
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
for um upgrade of equipment I think
 
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
would would the language in this bill
 
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
actually have sufficed to cover your
 
02:18:46.519 --> 02:18:49.669 align:start position:0%
actually have sufficed to cover your
circumstance

02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
that's a good point um I
 
02:18:55.709 --> 02:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
I I think that the system completely
 
02:18:57.309 --> 02:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
failed in our
 
02:18:59.950 --> 02:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
circumstance um but had it been a
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
priority I don't think that even if it
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
was based on the disruption on August
 
02:19:09.150 --> 02:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
1st um that there was any priority
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
within that fiber optic company when
 
02:19:13.469 --> 02:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do it on 9911 after
 
02:19:15.709 --> 02:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
August 1st that to me didn't seem like
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
priority when I see their vehicle on our
 
02:19:22.469 --> 02:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
Main Street every day so um maybe it not
 
02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
would not have been fixed as much as I'm
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
a very impatient person as quickly as I
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
felt appropriate for a public safety or
 
02:19:33.150 --> 02:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
public health um I don't think they
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
would have given us a a date of 911
 
02:19:38.429 --> 02:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
maybe if they had something in in uh
 
02:19:40.830 --> 02:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
response for the following day that
 
02:19:43.150 --> 02:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
would have been more
 
02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:45.519 align:start position:0%
appropriate representative Ms has a
 
02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and um thank
 
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
you chief for taking my question and
 
02:19:52.830 --> 02:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
your service to your community um can
 
02:19:54.349 --> 02:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
you share the name of the provider with
 
02:19:56.670 --> 02:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
us the fiber optic capable
 
02:20:01.389 --> 02:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
can sure it was it was first light
 
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative rolds has
 
02:20:11.950 --> 02:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chairman thank
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
you chief for being here um my question
 
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
is kind of following up on um
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative M's question you know I'm
 
02:20:22.910 --> 02:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
listened carefully to your um to the
 
02:20:26.190 --> 02:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
story and I'm looking at the language of
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
the bill and I'm just wondering
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
would this
 
02:20:36.990 --> 02:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
legislation had it been in
 
02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.270 align:start position:0%
legislation had it been in
effect

02:20:39.270 --> 02:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
effect
 
02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
um last year uh would it have solved the
 
02:20:45.950 --> 02:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
problem or I'm guess I'm wondering why
 
02:20:48.510 --> 02:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
the legislation it says
 
02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
that the the provider of fiber optic
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
service shall prioritize Public Safety
 
02:20:56.309 --> 02:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
over commercial and
 
02:20:59.110 --> 02:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
residential okay and as they say like
 
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
would think that a company would do that
 
02:21:05.389 --> 02:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
anyway so is there is there a part of
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
the story that you didn't tell that the
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
company um first light was was was
 
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
working on homes and businesses and and
 
02:21:17.389 --> 02:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
had service to them but not to the
 
02:21:20.670 --> 02:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
Public Safety facility I can't testify
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
for for First Light except that I know
 
02:21:25.349 --> 02:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
they had equipment in our region that
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
could have addressed it
 
02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:28.750 align:start position:0%
could have addressed it
immediately

02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:30.870 align:start position:0%
immediately
um

02:21:30.870 --> 02:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't believe I can answer your
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
question accurately unless we were to
 
02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
have testimony from first FL okay thank
 
02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
you additional questions for the
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
chief Vice chair Thomas has one thank
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
you uh m Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:21:50.309 --> 02:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
my question really quick because we've
 
02:21:50.319 --> 02:21:51.389 align:start position:0%
my question really quick because we've
had

02:21:51.389 --> 02:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:21:54.910 --> 02:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
a a bill kind of like this with an
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
unregulated agency before in the past I
 
02:21:59.910 --> 02:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
I have to ask the question did you by
 
02:22:02.349 --> 02:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
chance contact the Attorney General file
 
02:22:02.359 --> 02:22:04.030 align:start position:0%

complaint I find out if there's other

complaints I did
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
not just a consideration thank
 
02:22:13.870 --> 02:22:13.880 align:start position:0%

and give us uh your perspective on this
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
legislation next up we're going to hear

from Griffin Roberge of the Department
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:49.550 align:start position:0%
 
legislation

02:22:49.550 --> 02:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%

uh for the record Griffin Rober State
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
energy program manager at the uh New
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy um
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
registering respectful opposition to
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
this bill as introduced working its way
 
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
around the room right now is a letter of
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Department um as has
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
been discussed the bill uh requires
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
Communications Services providers um
 
02:23:20.269 --> 02:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
that provide service through fiber optic
 
02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
cables to prioritize the restoration of
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
service uh for Public Safety and public
 
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
health organizations over commercial and
 
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
residential customers um Again by way of
 
02:23:33.950 --> 02:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
background the state of New Hampshire
 
02:23:35.790 --> 02:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
has either largely deregulated
 
02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
Communication Service Pro service
 
02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
providers or this area is overseen by uh
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation um the state's
 
02:23:45.269 --> 02:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
limited roles in this realm are really
 
02:23:47.389 --> 02:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
focused on consumer fairs and saf safety
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
issues such as Crossing licenses across
 
02:23:53.950 --> 02:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
a state land or down poles and wires and
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
roadways um that might impact Public
 
02:23:59.710 --> 02:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
Safety or working between uh a customer
 
02:24:01.790 --> 02:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
and their utility provider to resolve an
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing uh concern um Department wanted
 
02:24:07.950 --> 02:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
to note several observations uh for the
 
02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
committee's uh consideration um there
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
are ambiguous terms um uh terminology in
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
the bill such as public safety and
 
02:24:18.670 --> 02:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
Public Health Organization on line six
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
while I think we all kind of know what
 
02:24:22.110 --> 02:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and public health
 
02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
organizations are I think other parties
 
02:24:26.469 --> 02:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
could reasonably argue that they are
 
02:24:28.110 --> 02:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
themselves Public Safety and public
 
02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:29.070 align:start position:0%
themselves Public Safety and public
health

02:24:29.070 --> 02:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:24:31.950 --> 02:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
organizations um one could make the
 
02:24:33.309 --> 02:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
again one could make the argument that
 
02:24:34.750 --> 02:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
they should be prioritized for
 
02:24:36.910 --> 02:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
restoration um if they provide a direct
 
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
or indirect Public Service um another
 
02:24:42.429 --> 02:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
note is again this puts the state in a
 
02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
role of re-regulating unregulated
 
02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
entities um again as I previously noted
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
this area has either been deregulated by
 
02:24:54.269 --> 02:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
the state or taken over uh by Federal
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
Regulation um to promote customer choice
 
02:25:00.030 --> 02:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
and competition um the passage of this
 
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
bill in its current form would
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
reintroduce the state into a type of
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory role over these entities um
 
02:25:09.389 --> 02:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
to ensure that certain customers have
 
02:25:12.110 --> 02:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
their service restored uh faster than
 
02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
others do um I did also want to note
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
that based on the previous testimony and
 
02:25:19.950 --> 02:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be fully transparent I'm
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
not fully aware of specifically all the
 
02:25:25.230 --> 02:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
ins and outs of this specific uh
 
02:25:28.389 --> 02:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
consumer case but the department does um
 
02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
have a consumer services division that
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
regularly helps consumers interacting
 
02:25:34.990 --> 02:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
with their utility or their service
 
02:25:37.469 --> 02:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
provider um such examples include
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
assistant customers if issues arise when
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
establishing new utility or provider
 
02:25:44.670 --> 02:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
service or acting as a mediator to
 
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
resolve disputes between customers and
 
02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
their utility or their provider uh folks
 
02:25:51.150 --> 02:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
are always willing to contact our
 
02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
consumer services division as many
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
around the state do every day um and we
 
02:25:56.670 --> 02:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
are more than willing to try to act in
 
02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
that mediat position for any
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
municipality um that might have
 
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
difficulty um resolving an ongoing issue
 
02:26:07.230 --> 02:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
um and with that uh happy to conclude my
 
02:26:08.910 --> 02:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and take any questions that
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
folks might have thank you very much
 
02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has one thank you
 
02:26:17.309 --> 02:26:17.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr Rober
 
02:26:18.590 --> 02:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just wondering if I get your
 
02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
opinion on this would this bill be
 
02:26:21.710 --> 02:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
better uh placed in the Commerce
 
02:26:25.349 --> 02:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
Committee would this be a uh a question
 
02:26:28.110 --> 02:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
of uh Comm you know you don't have to
 
02:26:30.150 --> 02:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
answer that that that that question is
 
02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
probably not relevant to our proceeding
 
02:26:36.910 --> 02:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
here okay representative Ms thank you Mr
 
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
chair and uh thank you Mr robers
 
02:26:43.469 --> 02:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure you can help me with
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
this but um so a company like like for
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
first fiber first light fiber do they do
 
02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
they run their own
 
02:26:55.269 --> 02:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
cables for that for specifically for
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
their fiber optic Communications or are
 
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
they sharing them with other
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
companies okay sorry I didn't know if
 
02:27:04.870 --> 02:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
you were going to keep going that sorry
 
02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so um I am
 
02:27:11.710 --> 02:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
again not familiar with the specifics of
 
02:27:14.190 --> 02:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
this circumstance um but do want to note
 
02:27:15.790 --> 02:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
that it you know it is my understanding
 
02:27:16.990 --> 02:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
that first light with haveit own
 
02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure on utility polls that run
 
02:27:21.550 --> 02:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
through S Litteton and then off of there
 
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
they Branch to different customers to
 
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
provide service um you know and I I also
 
02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
do want to take the opportunity to also
 
02:27:31.710 --> 02:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
note that you know we at the department
 
02:27:34.030 --> 02:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
became aware of this specific
 
02:27:36.110 --> 02:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
circumstance after it had occurred and
 
02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
after it had fully resolved itself um
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
and I understand the concern from those
 
02:27:43.630 --> 02:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
in Littleton about the the speed at
 
02:27:46.269 --> 02:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
which um service was restored and that
 
02:27:48.510 --> 02:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
type of thing thing um obviously again I
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the particulars of
 
02:27:54.750 --> 02:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
um of the interactions amongst all the
 
02:27:57.190 --> 02:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
parties but you know based on our
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
perspective is that this wasn't some
 
02:28:01.630 --> 02:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
type of weather event or severe weather
 
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
event where you know lilton went without
 
02:28:06.790 --> 02:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
service for a significant span of time
 
02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
due to a natural event you know this
 
02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
seems more like a customer service
 
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
related um issue um you know I would
 
02:28:15.550 --> 02:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
just note that in the future if such
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
issues do arise more than will to
 
02:28:18.750 --> 02:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
contact the department of energy and our
 
02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
consumer services division as I
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
basis Vice chair Thomas has a question
 
02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks again for
 
02:28:32.590 --> 02:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um I completely
 
02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
understand about the the concern about
 
02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
regulating and unregulated uh agency I
 
02:28:39.190 --> 02:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
also concern about being a private
 
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
organization as well but uh is there
 
02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:44.030 align:start position:0%
organization as well but uh is there
anything

02:28:44.030 --> 02:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:28:47.469 --> 02:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
in statute or regulations or rules or
 
02:28:49.790 --> 02:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
whatever when a company comes to do
 
02:28:53.269 --> 02:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
business here in the state that would
 
02:28:56.309 --> 02:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
when they set a business here that they
 
02:28:58.910 --> 02:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
that there would be some type of um
 
02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
statement saying that on critical or
 
02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:02.710 align:start position:0%
statement saying that on critical or
Safety

02:29:02.710 --> 02:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
Services uh must be considered uh in
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
terms of ensuring that
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
services available under any any
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
circumstance sure and something like
 
02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
that sure thank for the question so
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
obviously as private companies you know
 
02:29:21.550 --> 02:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
they solicit customers as any normal
 
02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
business does um but it's my
 
02:29:25.950 --> 02:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that a lot of these um
 
02:29:28.510 --> 02:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
companies like first light maybe Comcast
 
02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
others you know they realize the
 
02:29:33.790 --> 02:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
importance of prioritizing the
 
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
restoration of critical infrastructure
 
02:29:38.110 --> 02:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
such as police departments Town Halls
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
water sewer utilities Etc so I believe
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
that they have policies in place and
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
work specifically with those th with
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
those towns those entities um to ensure
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
that they have maybe Priority Access to
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
the company to reach out if there are
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
concerns reach out um if there are any
 
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
major questions again obviously I
 
02:29:58.469 --> 02:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
realize I cannot speak to the
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
particulars of this uh first light
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
instance but um yes I would say that
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
when companies do arrive in the state
 
02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that they work with their with
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
their customers to identify ways that
 
02:30:11.230 --> 02:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
they can contact them if needs arise
 
02:30:13.230 --> 02:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um this is regarding
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
point one
 
02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
on your on your written testimony where
 
02:30:22.429 --> 02:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
you say that there's ambiguous terms are
 
02:30:23.950 --> 02:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
you telling us that the department of
 
02:30:26.429 --> 02:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
education does Department of energy
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
sorry does not have a definition for
 
02:30:31.230 --> 02:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
disruption of service or that the state
 
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire does not have a
 
02:30:34.590 --> 02:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
definition for Public Safety and public
 
02:30:36.550 --> 02:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
health organizations sure and thank you
 
02:30:37.750 --> 02:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
for the question so I'm sure that there
 
02:30:39.710 --> 02:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
are but again in this specific bill that
 
02:30:41.469 --> 02:30:41.479 align:start position:0%
is not specifically reference it doesn't
 
02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
reference any other area of Statute or
 
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
anything like that as to what Public
 
02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
Safety or public public health
 
02:30:49.309 --> 02:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
organizations or what uh disruption of
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
service is again you know and I do want
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
to take the opportunity to note um the
 
02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor's willingness to speak
 
02:30:59.150 --> 02:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
with the Department about this bill um
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative mamila did reach out to
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
us asking questions about how best to
 
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
format the bill obviously we're at
 
02:31:07.830 --> 02:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
different ends of the bill but um we
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
were honest candid with each other about
 
02:31:11.550 --> 02:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
where we were coming from on on these
 
02:31:13.230 --> 02:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
respective issues and we did highlight
 
02:31:15.070 --> 02:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
in a um I did highlight in a
 
02:31:16.590 --> 02:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
conversation with the prime sponsor last
 
02:31:18.389 --> 02:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
week that you know we would be coming in
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
to identify that this was an area of
 
02:31:22.950 --> 02:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
concern that we had in the bill um to
 
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
answer your immediate question are there
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
areas um in State Statute where Public
 
02:31:29.469 --> 02:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
Safety or public health organizations
 
02:31:31.630 --> 02:31:31.640 align:start position:0%
might be defined I would say there may
 
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
be I'm not a lawyer I don't know off the
 
02:31:37.790 --> 02:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
top of my head followup follow up if if
 
02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
if there are cases or if there may be
 
02:31:42.590 --> 02:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
cases as you suspect is it fair to say
 
02:31:45.910 --> 02:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
that this is um that that this bill does
 
02:31:47.710 --> 02:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
not def Define them I mean if it's
 
02:31:49.710 --> 02:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
already established in previous law it
 
02:31:52.510 --> 02:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be defined redefined
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I thank you for the question so yes
 
02:31:56.910 --> 02:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
and you know the other thing I do want
 
02:32:02.269 --> 02:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:05.269 --> 02:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
know I think in our read of the bill
 
02:32:07.070 --> 02:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
that this was The Way It Was Written is
 
02:32:09.550 --> 02:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
that it was focused on maybe weather
 
02:32:12.070 --> 02:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
events that cause massive disruptions of
 
02:32:14.469 --> 02:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
service but we re but I think we
 
02:32:16.590 --> 02:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
recognize based on the specifics of this
 
02:32:20.910 --> 02:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
case that introducing this level of
 
02:32:24.110 --> 02:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
State oversight on a
 
02:32:27.190 --> 02:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
relatively on a ver on a constit on an
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
isolated consumer issue that occurred
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
might be a heavy-handed approach to take
 
02:32:34.710 --> 02:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
um again in conversations with our
 
02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
consumer services division issues like
 
02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
this do happen relatively
 
02:32:41.950 --> 02:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
infrequently um you know maybe one or
 
02:32:45.070 --> 02:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
two cases occurring maybe a year so
 
02:32:47.550 --> 02:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
again if instances like that do occur we
 
02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
encourage folks to certainly reach out
 
02:32:50.309 --> 02:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
to our department and we're more than
 
02:32:51.910 --> 02:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
willing to help try to mediate that I
 
02:32:54.030 --> 02:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
realize it's a long answer and it's all
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
the way around but just wanted to make
 
02:32:57.950 --> 02:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
the point thank
 
02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:00.560 align:start position:0%

telephone Granite State uh TDS and
 
02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
Breton woods and I also represent
 
02:33:39.550 --> 02:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Communications and we
 
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
respectfully oppose this bill and we are
 
02:33:46.429 --> 02:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
not opposing by any means that Public
 
02:33:48.269 --> 02:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
Safety and public health is not number
 
02:33:51.150 --> 02:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
one but we already have protocols we've
 
02:33:54.750 --> 02:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
had them for decades we are the old Mell
 
02:33:56.990 --> 02:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
landline companies that were highly
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
regulated way back when and so we've had
 
02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
protocols in fact in Consolidated case
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
they've had protocols since over over a
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
century um so we don't think this is
 
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
necessary and I would agree with the
 
02:34:15.469 --> 02:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
Department of energy that this does look
 
02:34:19.710 --> 02:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
like more customer service than weather
 
02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
Etc or outages Etc um we also all our
 
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
companies have a very good working
 
02:34:28.150 --> 02:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
relationship with the Public Utilities
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
Commission and doe and I will say in my
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
experience and and as well as the
 
02:34:36.910 --> 02:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
companies over the years if there's an
 
02:34:39.070 --> 02:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
issue particularly a customer service
 
02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
issue and the Pu or the consumer
 
02:34:44.790 --> 02:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
Advocate it's called we usually get a
 
02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
telephone call you know hey just want to
 
02:34:50.349 --> 02:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
let you know this is going on and we've
 
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
gotten this complaint so there is a good
 
02:34:55.630 --> 02:34:55.640 align:start position:0%
communication and good working working
 
02:35:00.269 --> 02:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
relationship there um we also sit on the
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
um 911 Commission
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
so clearly coordination cooperation with
 
02:35:09.550 --> 02:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety so I would say
 
02:35:12.110 --> 02:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
to I'm very sorry to have to oppose what
 
02:35:14.030 --> 02:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're opposing Public Safety
 
02:35:16.830 --> 02:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
but we're not because we really do now
 
02:35:20.030 --> 02:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
and um this is not as you've heard this
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
is not a customer of ours and I'm sorry
 
02:35:25.150 --> 02:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
it happened I feel badly for for
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
Littleton I can't imagine what a
 
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
horrible situation but I'd be happy to
 
02:35:33.510 --> 02:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
take any any questions on it thank you
 
02:35:36.030 --> 02:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas has a question thank
 
02:35:37.870 --> 02:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
02:35:42.389 --> 02:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
question so um I'll ask this not in a
 
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
negative way but it sounds like you were
 
02:35:49.469 --> 02:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
were saying that perhaps uh uh the
 
02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
customer contacted the wrong people with
 
02:35:54.630 --> 02:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
with their issue because they they
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
weren't able to get a resolved very
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
quickly at all I'm not sure who they
 
02:36:01.469 --> 02:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
contacted all I know is from my
 
02:36:05.550 --> 02:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
experience if and and and I've asked the
 
02:36:08.110 --> 02:36:08.120 align:start position:0%
companies now because I did run fearo at
 
02:36:09.950 --> 02:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
one point and I did get calls from the
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
Pu quite a bit oh by the way there's a
 
02:36:14.790 --> 02:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
problem in West Morland or there's a
 
02:36:16.310 --> 02:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
problem here
 
02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:17.870 align:start position:0%
problem here
[Music]

02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:36:20.710 --> 02:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
um we certainly have communication
 
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
meaning the landline companies with the
 
02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
the um consumer Folks at the Pu you
 
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
would hope they would call if there was
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
an issue I don't know what happened in
 
02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
this case I I don't know I don't know
 
02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
who the police chief called I don't know
 
02:36:38.230 --> 02:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the communication was
 
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
I assume it was directly with the
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
company follow up I'm not sure I
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
answered that the way you wanted or the
 
02:36:48.510 --> 02:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
way you asked you you did answer it U uh
 
02:36:50.670 --> 02:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
because you don't know but no I don't U
 
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
but uh so in the future what would you
 
02:36:57.469 --> 02:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
what would you recommend uh on something
 
02:37:00.750 --> 02:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
like as critical as a say the the police
 
02:37:03.750 --> 02:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
or even health and safety in the future
 
02:37:06.349 --> 02:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
could you recommend anything in here
 
02:37:10.070 --> 02:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
that could be stated uh or at least made
 
02:37:13.230 --> 02:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
known about who to call to get immediate
 
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
relief I guess besides going to the AG I
 
02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:17.469 align:start position:0%
relief I guess besides going to the AG I
guess

02:37:17.469 --> 02:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
guess
 
02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
I would certainly say I wouldn't put it
 
02:37:23.230 --> 02:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
in statute and I know for my companies
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
they work well with the municipalities
 
02:37:28.110 --> 02:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
and there usually is a contact person
 
02:37:30.110 --> 02:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
with particularly because of police and
 
02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
fire there's a specific contact person
 
02:37:35.269 --> 02:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
so I don't think this needs to be
 
02:37:37.469 --> 02:37:37.479 align:start position:0%
legislated if you do anything maybe
 
02:37:41.389 --> 02:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
interim study it but because the process
 
02:37:43.269 --> 02:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
seems to be working at least on the
 
02:37:46.429 --> 02:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
landline side and it sounds like from I
 
02:37:49.870 --> 02:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
saw uh Miss Weston's testimony for Nea
 
02:37:51.630 --> 02:37:51.640 align:start position:0%
it certainly seems like is working on
 
02:37:56.070 --> 02:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
the cable side so um I think better
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
communication of better Point persons
 
02:38:01.349 --> 02:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
with whoever the contractor is the
 
02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
suggestion

02:38:08.070 --> 02:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative Ms has a question
 
02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question and nice to see you
 
02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
again um necta is that the organization
 
02:38:22.910 --> 02:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
that that a company like f like first
 
02:38:25.389 --> 02:38:25.399 align:start position:0%
light would be part of do they are they
 
02:38:28.710 --> 02:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
the the internet provider no I think and
 
02:38:30.910 --> 02:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
I think Miss Weston is behind me so she
 
02:38:33.550 --> 02:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
can clarify if I'm not correct necta is
 
02:38:37.389 --> 02:38:37.399 align:start position:0%
the cable company so it would be comf
 
02:38:39.790 --> 02:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
Charter Charter
 
02:38:41.950 --> 02:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
Spectrum and Spectrum I think it's
 
02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
Comcast Charter and Spectrum okay so I
 
02:38:48.349 --> 02:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
don't know who first
 
02:38:52.110 --> 02:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
light who they're associated with but um
 
02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
but I do know the cable companies and
 
02:38:57.870 --> 02:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
the AL Mell companies all have processes
 
02:39:00.269 --> 02:39:00.279 align:start position:0%
in place that have been working well as
 
02:39:02.190 --> 02:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
far as this is concerned and there the
 
02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
other thing I did not
 
02:39:07.389 --> 02:39:07.399 align:start position:0%
say it is very clear that we have to
 
02:39:10.710 --> 02:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
wait for electric so if there's a
 
02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
disruption of service for example a
 
02:39:16.469 --> 02:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
weather event electric has has first
 
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
they have to go up first we we can't go
 
02:39:20.950 --> 02:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
up because obviously it's really
 
02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous if you've got electrical wires
 
02:39:27.230 --> 02:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
that are that are alive and Etc so
 
02:39:30.349 --> 02:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a disaster or
 
02:39:32.110 --> 02:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
disruption of service they're first and
 
02:39:33.670 --> 02:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
then we go
 
02:39:37.429 --> 02:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
next representative PL has a
 
02:39:39.510 --> 02:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair and thank you
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I didn't quite
 
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
hear but could you offer some
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
information you might know on the
 
02:39:53.349 --> 02:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
providers you represent do they now
 
02:39:56.830 --> 02:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
prioritize between residential
 
02:39:59.630 --> 02:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
commercial and public service for
 
02:40:02.830 --> 02:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
disruption of Serv of yeah Public Safety
 
02:40:04.389 --> 02:40:04.399 align:start position:0%
for disruption of service is that
 
02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
already being done yes that has been
 
02:40:08.990 --> 02:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
done for decades with my clients and it
 
02:40:13.269 --> 02:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
is police fire and then health so it's
 
02:40:16.309 --> 02:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
police fire hospitals any that goes in
 
02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
that health emergency but police and
 
02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
fire are at the top of the the top of
 
02:40:23.469 --> 02:40:23.479 align:start position:0%
the list public health and Public Safety
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
um are absolutely top of the list and
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
they always have been I don't know this
 
02:40:30.030 --> 02:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
for a fact but I would guess way back
 
02:40:32.550 --> 02:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
when when there was all the regulation
 
02:40:34.469 --> 02:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
and these companies started that was a
 
02:40:37.070 --> 02:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
priority and I certainly know when when
 
02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
I ran fear point there was absolutely no
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
question what was number one and even
 
02:40:44.070 --> 02:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
though you might have mad customers
 
02:40:45.550 --> 02:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
calling up saying why aren't you
 
02:40:47.150 --> 02:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
restoring my service well you got to get
 
02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
police and fire number one in the
 
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals that I mean
 
02:40:55.190 --> 02:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's what we value frankly
 
02:40:57.349 --> 02:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
02:40:58.510 --> 02:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and thank you for taking
 
02:41:00.950 --> 02:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
my question um just with regard to your
 
02:41:03.710 --> 02:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
company um one of the biggest complaints
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
I get on anything is not able to contact
 
02:41:09.870 --> 02:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
people so if I were to pick up the phone
 
02:41:12.790 --> 02:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
now and called one of your companies uh
 
02:41:14.990 --> 02:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
what I get we value very much as a
 
02:41:16.750 --> 02:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
customer your approximate wait time will
 
02:41:19.070 --> 02:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
be three and a half years or will
 
02:41:22.750 --> 02:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
somebody actually answer the phone well
 
02:41:24.429 --> 02:41:24.439 align:start position:0%
you know that's what we're talking about
 
02:41:27.309 --> 02:41:27.319 align:start position:0%

02:41:29.910 --> 02:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
tell you when I call I get a person and
 
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
I end up getting service now I don't
 
02:41:34.950 --> 02:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
have a special number but I do and I
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
will honestly tell you I haven't called
 
02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
Breton Woods or Granite State recently
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
consol I'm conquered and Consolidated
 
02:41:44.309 --> 02:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
it's my my carrier and I get I get
 
02:41:46.710 --> 02:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
service I get an and I get people out
 
02:41:49.389 --> 02:41:49.399 align:start position:0%
there and U and particularly when my
 
02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
internet goes down I'm calling oh my God
 
02:41:54.630 --> 02:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
I can't work cuz during Co I work work
 
02:41:59.190 --> 02:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
from home um you know on a with a storm
 
02:42:00.990 --> 02:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
you might you might have to hold a few
 
02:42:03.670 --> 02:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
minutes but I certainly have gotten um
 
02:42:06.710 --> 02:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
gotten people okay quick followup follow
 
02:42:10.269 --> 02:42:10.279 align:start position:0%
up did the police on Fire have a uh like
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
a hotline number where they call with a
 
02:42:15.550 --> 02:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
247 is person going to answer the phone
 
02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
or do they put on or they call on the
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
same place that everybody else every
 
02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
other customer calls it is my
 
02:42:24.030 --> 02:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
understanding and it certainly was when
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
I was at FairPoint but it's my
 
02:42:28.110 --> 02:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
understanding there's a special oh
 
02:42:30.550 --> 02:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
there's a specific contact with police
 
02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:31.349 align:start position:0%
there's a specific contact with police
and

02:42:31.349 --> 02:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
fire I don't know whether it's I don't
 
02:42:36.590 --> 02:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
know what the phone number is but but I
 
02:42:38.950 --> 02:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately think or I should say
 
02:42:42.030 --> 02:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
fortunately think you and you and I are
 
02:42:45.550 --> 02:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
not quite treated like like police on
 
02:42:48.790 --> 02:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:51.070 --> 02:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
good the only thing standing between us
 
02:42:53.070 --> 02:42:53.080 align:start position:0%
and lunch is representative McGee has a
 
02:42:56.750 --> 02:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
question and that is not unusual okay um
 
02:42:59.790 --> 02:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
so from listening to all this gone on I
 
02:43:02.389 --> 02:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
I would like you to comment on this is a
 
02:43:03.950 --> 02:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
company that's not associated with you
 
02:43:05.870 --> 02:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
and you say you have protocols in place
 
02:43:07.790 --> 02:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
where the police and fire would have
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
that priority so if it seems like there
 
02:43:13.030 --> 02:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't that priority placed on the you
 
02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
know the Advan notice nothing was done
 
02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
it just
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
inside the company things weren't going
 
02:43:20.830 --> 02:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
well would you recommend that that the
 
02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
chief use um Littleton Town Council or
 
02:43:27.150 --> 02:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
or Littleton Town officials to reach out
 
02:43:28.469 --> 02:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
to the company because it seems like
 
02:43:30.670 --> 02:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
it's an issue with the company that
 
02:43:32.309 --> 02:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
needs to be straightened out in terms of
 
02:43:35.630 --> 02:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
their priorities I would honestly think
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
if you got a call from the police chief
 
02:43:40.230 --> 02:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
you would act I mean frankly if Town
 
02:43:42.269 --> 02:43:42.279 align:start position:0%
Council fine and dandy but if the police
 
02:43:45.469 --> 02:43:45.479 align:start position:0%
chief calls I would think you would go
 
02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
all the way at the top and and I mean
 
02:43:50.830 --> 02:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's surprising to me from a customer
 
02:43:50.840 --> 02:43:51.870 align:start position:0%
it's surprising to me from a customer
service

02:43:51.870 --> 02:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:43:54.429 --> 02:43:54.439 align:start position:0%
perspective um that this happened and I
 
02:43:55.790 --> 02:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
think it's really unfortunate but you
 
02:43:58.670 --> 02:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
would sure think you go to the the top
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
and even if you had to leave a voicemail
 
02:44:03.349 --> 02:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
you would think if somebody answered the
 
02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
voicemail they go oh gosh it's the
 
02:44:07.110 --> 02:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
Littleton Police
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:14.830 --> 02:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
this okay I guess okay yeah thank you I
 
02:44:16.750 --> 02:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate thank you and if you would if
 
02:44:18.550 --> 02:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
you would like I'll be happy to call all
 
02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
my companies and see if they answer the
 
02:44:22.990 --> 02:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
phone okay if you want to take the time
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
to do that feel free well I F all right
 
02:44:27.269 --> 02:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
having no more pink cards I'm going to
 
02:44:30.550 --> 02:44:30.560 align:start position:0%

Utilities we'll follow that with a
 
04:02:10.110 --> 04:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing on hb600 FN relative to
 
04:02:12.269 --> 04:02:12.279 align:start position:0%

day with a hearing on hb1 1644 FN

requiring the department of energy to
 
04:02:23.110 --> 04:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
initiate an investigation of the
 
04:02:24.750 --> 04:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
benefits and key considerations
 
04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
regarding support for clean or noncarbon
 
04:02:30.510 --> 04:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
emitting power
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
generation so let's first open a public
 
04:02:38.910 --> 04:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb7 1576 FN relative to
 
04:02:40.910 --> 04:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
allowing Property Owners to opt out of
 
04:02:43.389 --> 04:02:43.399 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities and I'll ask the prime
 
04:02:46.229 --> 04:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Eric Alan to
 
04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
introduce this proposed legislation to
 
04:02:50.670 --> 04:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you representative
 
04:02:53.070 --> 04:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
for being here good to see you good to
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
see you too Mr chairman thank you all so
 
04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
much for coming back hopefully refreshed
 
04:02:58.910 --> 04:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
from lunch and ready to talk about some
 
04:03:01.349 --> 04:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
great topics here for the record my name
 
04:03:03.229 --> 04:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
is Erica Lon and I'm a state
 
04:03:06.349 --> 04:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
representative from Derry um before I
 
04:03:08.269 --> 04:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
moved to Derry I actually was looking
 
04:03:10.910 --> 04:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
only at homes that had um had Public
 
04:03:12.630 --> 04:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer because the idea of a
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
septic system scared me now that I've
 
04:03:16.950 --> 04:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
been on a well in a septic system for
 
04:03:20.550 --> 04:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
over 20 years I love it um so the reason
 
04:03:22.830 --> 04:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
that I filed this bill is because we
 
04:03:24.790 --> 04:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
have more and more areas where there are
 
04:03:26.950 --> 04:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
sewer sewer and water projects that are
 
04:03:29.550 --> 04:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
passing existing properties in order to
 
04:03:31.710 --> 04:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
go to new developments or to go to
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
failed sites either for Wells or for
 
04:03:36.630 --> 04:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
septic systems um there does not seem to
 
04:03:39.229 --> 04:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
be consistency on how those passing
 
04:03:40.990 --> 04:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
homeowners and property owners are
 
04:03:43.349 --> 04:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
treated um to whether they're able to
 
04:03:46.229 --> 04:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
opt out or if they're forced to opt in
 
04:03:48.510 --> 04:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
or if a neighborhood requires everybody
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
to participate in order to offer that
 
04:03:51.550 --> 04:03:51.560 align:start position:0%
water and
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
sewer unless you have a failed well or a
 
04:03:57.229 --> 04:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
failed septic system um I believe that a
 
04:04:00.590 --> 04:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
property owner should be able to opt out
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
of that public water and sewer that are
 
04:04:04.229 --> 04:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
coming by and continue to use a
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
functioning well and a functioning sewer
 
04:04:09.469 --> 04:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
Sy septic system by doing that you more
 
04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
have to be more aware of what goes down
 
04:04:13.630 --> 04:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
your waist we're careful about what
 
04:04:15.710 --> 04:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
toilet paper what wipes go down there
 
04:04:18.349 --> 04:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
you're far more sensitive when you are
 
04:04:19.950 --> 04:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
the one who is on the hook for fixing
 
04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
what happens with your septic system and
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
it it also leads to a lot more people
 
04:04:26.309 --> 04:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
paying more attention to the actual
 
04:04:27.750 --> 04:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
quality of the water that the family is
 
04:04:29.910 --> 04:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
drinking because it is your well water I
 
04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
think it keeps you closer to Nature it
 
04:04:33.309 --> 04:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
keeps you closer to your environment and
 
04:04:35.550 --> 04:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
makes you a better Steward of what is
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
around you I recognize that some people
 
04:04:40.429 --> 04:04:40.439 align:start position:0%
don't take on those responsibilities but
 
04:04:41.910 --> 04:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's life there are some
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
people who are less responsible and we
 
04:04:45.710 --> 04:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
do have the ability to deal with failed
 
04:04:48.429 --> 04:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
SE systems and there are already those
 
04:04:50.630 --> 04:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
processes in place um we actually have
 
04:04:52.389 --> 04:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
some of the septic systems in Dairy
 
04:04:53.950 --> 04:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
because there were failed septic systems
 
04:04:56.910 --> 04:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
around Beaver Lake and in that situation
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
I would not say that somebody should be
 
04:05:01.149 --> 04:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
able to opt out um because at that point
 
04:05:03.389 --> 04:05:03.399 align:start position:0%
you have an environmental hazard the
 
04:05:06.229 --> 04:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
question becomes should I have to tie in
 
04:05:08.469 --> 04:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
just because it passes my property
 
04:05:10.590 --> 04:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
I believe that that default should be no
 
04:05:13.030 --> 04:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
it should be voluntary and that's why I
 
04:05:15.469 --> 04:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
filed this bill I did draft it largely
 
04:05:18.309 --> 04:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
to all public utilities because I had
 
04:05:19.830 --> 04:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
heard of people who were told that they
 
04:05:21.910 --> 04:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
were not able to be fully off-grid for
 
04:05:24.630 --> 04:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
electrical reasons um apparently that's
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
entirely fine and people are allowed to
 
04:05:29.429 --> 04:05:29.439 align:start position:0%
not connect into the grid since that's
 
04:05:31.510 --> 04:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
not a problem I don't have concern over
 
04:05:33.189 --> 04:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
that and I'd be happy to narrow the
 
04:05:36.269 --> 04:05:36.279 align:start position:0%
scope of this to only Water and Sewer um
 
04:05:38.070 --> 04:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
but my intention is just to allow people
 
04:05:40.429 --> 04:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
to continue to be close to their land to
 
04:05:42.110 --> 04:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
continue to manage that water that comes
 
04:05:44.670 --> 04:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
in and goes out be a good Steward and
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
not need to tie in to town Water and
 
04:05:49.550 --> 04:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
Sewer if they would rather continue to
 
04:05:51.790 --> 04:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
have that responsibility on their own
 
04:05:55.309 --> 04:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:57.950 --> 04:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you good introduction to
 
04:05:59.910 --> 04:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
the bill and I'm sure we do have some
 
04:06:01.510 --> 04:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee would
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
like to start thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:06:05.189 --> 04:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Lan for taking
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
my question so the question that I had
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
in reading the bit Bill about um giving
 
04:06:12.309 --> 04:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
the option for connection or capping
 
04:06:14.950 --> 04:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
when a project is coming through is
 
04:06:20.149 --> 04:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
whether you discussed this with any um
 
04:06:22.149 --> 04:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
people Town people who are responsible
 
04:06:25.389 --> 04:06:25.399 align:start position:0%
for water and store because um my
 
04:06:28.030 --> 04:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
question would be around um whether
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between rural areas
 
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
like mine where I have my own well and
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
septic like you were describing it's
 
04:06:36.510 --> 04:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
very common in certain areas but in
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
other areas
 
04:06:41.550 --> 04:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
it isn't and the the water system or the
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
sewage system is definitely part of the
 
04:06:47.389 --> 04:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that is maintained on the
 
04:06:50.229 --> 04:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
whole for the benefit of the many and it
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
would maybe be problematic if people
 
04:06:54.910 --> 04:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
were opting out so did you do any
 
04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
Research into how it would actually work
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh well thank you for the question I'm
 
04:07:00.429 --> 04:07:00.439 align:start position:0%
going to take that sort of as a two-part
 
04:07:02.189 --> 04:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
question one about the way of connecting
 
04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
and the other about the very small uh
 
04:07:07.870 --> 04:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
more densely packed Lots um looking at
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
all the regulations around septic
 
04:07:11.189 --> 04:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
systems you need to have a certain
 
04:07:12.550 --> 04:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
setback and you need to have a certain
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
radius in order to have your septic
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
system be one that can be certified and
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
approved um I believe in the language of
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and in my intention for this
 
04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
bill if you're not able to have an
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
allowed permitted septic system you
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that option of opting out
 
04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
so by saying that by by leaving it to
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
those existing rules and statutes about
 
04:07:35.030 --> 04:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
what is an acceptable septic system I
 
04:07:37.389 --> 04:07:37.399 align:start position:0%
believe that would address the issues
 
04:07:40.189 --> 04:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
around any any close any very small
 
04:07:42.630 --> 04:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
properties that would not support um
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
their own septic system so um I I don't
 
04:07:47.550 --> 04:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
believe that there would be challenges
 
04:07:49.710 --> 04:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
with that but that's but if there's any
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
sort of um unique situations that' be
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
interesting to hear about um the second
 
04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
is um the way that we attach to our
 
04:07:59.070 --> 04:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
properties I believe goes all the way up
 
04:08:01.309 --> 04:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
to the exterior of the home here I do
 
04:08:03.990 --> 04:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
have to say that some of my Approach was
 
04:08:05.910 --> 04:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
slightly colored by dealing with a
 
04:08:08.189 --> 04:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
massive failure of water and sewer at a
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
family member's house in another
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
location where they do actually just
 
04:08:14.309 --> 04:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
have a box that they come to and it's
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
the city responsibility to that box and
 
04:08:19.269 --> 04:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
it's the homeowner beyond that and
 
04:08:21.229 --> 04:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
within that idea where it's only Built
 
04:08:23.109 --> 04:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
out to a certain distance and that the
 
04:08:25.229 --> 04:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
homeowner's responsibility to continue
 
04:08:27.389 --> 04:08:27.399 align:start position:0%
that path to the house my thought was
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
that that would be a lower cost process
 
04:08:31.510 --> 04:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
I did see the testimony from um that was
 
04:08:33.710 --> 04:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
emailed from um the depart Department of
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and uh the fact
 
04:08:37.950 --> 04:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
that you can actually tap into it in the
 
04:08:40.109 --> 04:08:40.119 align:start position:0%
future I think is wonderful and great
 
04:08:42.469 --> 04:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
and would probably remove the need to
 
04:08:45.149 --> 04:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
have one of those hookup sections unless
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
you had something like a brand new road
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
that was being paved and you wouldn't be
 
04:08:51.469 --> 04:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
able to access it I I simply want to
 
04:08:53.469 --> 04:08:53.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that one homeowner's Choice
 
04:08:55.109 --> 04:08:55.119 align:start position:0%
isn't going to FLIR close on the choice
 
04:08:57.030 --> 04:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
for anybody who purchases that property
 
04:08:59.429 --> 04:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
in the future which is why I wanted to
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that you weren't creating a
 
04:09:03.630 --> 04:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
situation where the cost to tapen in the
 
04:09:07.149 --> 04:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
future could be exorbitant um either
 
04:09:09.510 --> 04:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
because of the potential that not the
 
04:09:11.550 --> 04:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
people involved now but I try and
 
04:09:13.469 --> 04:09:13.479 align:start position:0%
legislate for the people who may someday
 
04:09:15.429 --> 04:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
in it be in a position I want to make
 
04:09:16.870 --> 04:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
sure that if somebody wanted to be
 
04:09:19.030 --> 04:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
punitive about that um they wouldn't be
 
04:09:20.269 --> 04:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
able to and that's why there was a
 
04:09:21.870 --> 04:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
section about the reasonableness of the
 
04:09:24.109 --> 04:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
fees I don't expect that anybody who's
 
04:09:25.710 --> 04:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
in the Departments today would be doing
 
04:09:27.670 --> 04:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
that but I'd rather legislate for the
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
possibilities as opposed to the good
 
04:09:31.229 --> 04:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
people who are here today I just see
 
04:09:33.630 --> 04:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
that as responsible legislating so it
 
04:09:36.590 --> 04:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
was my attemption to my attempt to meet
 
04:09:38.070 --> 04:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
the needs between the two but if there's
 
04:09:39.710 --> 04:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
other solutions to that i' I'd love to
 
04:09:43.469 --> 04:09:43.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:46.229 --> 04:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
them okay representative Corman had a
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:09:50.830 --> 04:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so uh in
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
response to representative McGee you
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
said that uh if a homeowner has a
 
04:09:59.429 --> 04:09:59.439 align:start position:0%
property that is not cleared for a
 
04:10:02.429 --> 04:10:02.439 align:start position:0%
septic then uh they may opt out can you
 
04:10:03.790 --> 04:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
point me to where it says that in the
 
04:10:06.030 --> 04:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
bill please um it's that they would not
 
04:10:08.830 --> 04:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
be able to opt out so when I ni yeah I'm
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
yes it looks that that was left out of
 
04:10:40.830 --> 04:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
the draft and I apologize for that I had
 
04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
language that I had sent over to OS for
 
04:10:44.790 --> 04:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
that and I'd be very happy to bring that
 
04:10:46.830 --> 04:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
back in for you I apologize for missing
 
04:10:48.750 --> 04:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
that oversight in the drafting process
 
04:10:48.760 --> 04:10:50.510 align:start position:0%
that oversight in the drafting process
thank

04:10:50.510 --> 04:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:10:50.520 --> 04:10:52.030 align:start position:0%
thank
you

04:10:52.030 --> 04:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:10:55.149 --> 04:10:55.159 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
04:10:58.510 --> 04:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so we're a little
 
04:10:59.830 --> 04:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
different in my neighborhood we have
 
04:11:01.750 --> 04:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
four houses that have private Wells that
 
04:11:04.149 --> 04:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
are so contaminated with past that we're
 
04:11:06.109 --> 04:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
waiting we're desperately waiting to be
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
connected up to public water
 
04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
um right now those four houses we live
 
04:11:13.349 --> 04:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
on bottled water for everything that we
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
drink or cook you know it's it's pretty
 
04:11:19.790 --> 04:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
bad so my question is if somebody is
 
04:11:22.550 --> 04:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
choosing to opt out of let's say public
 
04:11:25.030 --> 04:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
water coming down their street is there
 
04:11:27.070 --> 04:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
some kind of a mechanism to make sure
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
that the water that they're keeping
 
04:11:32.149 --> 04:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
their private well is is healthy and
 
04:11:34.109 --> 04:11:34.119 align:start position:0%
uncontaminated or does that have nothing
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
to do with us uh well thank you for that
 
04:11:39.830 --> 04:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
question um as far as that goes it's a
 
04:11:41.550 --> 04:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the homeowner to know
 
04:11:43.630 --> 04:11:43.640 align:start position:0%
the quality of their water and when
 
04:11:44.710 --> 04:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
there's already an existing
 
04:11:46.990 --> 04:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
well-published publicized issue such as
 
04:11:49.149 --> 04:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
what you're facing in your community um
 
04:11:51.269 --> 04:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
it'd be quite shocking for somebody not
 
04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
to do that however there are mitigation
 
04:11:56.229 --> 04:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
Pro uh processes I know that in our
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
house we have pretty good water um but
 
04:12:00.670 --> 04:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
we still do a good amount of treatment
 
04:12:02.349 --> 04:12:02.359 align:start position:0%
between a water softener a whole house
 
04:12:06.189 --> 04:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
filter and then R for um the more for
 
04:12:08.149 --> 04:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
any of our drinking water obviously not
 
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
for the showers because that would cause
 
04:12:11.790 --> 04:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
extra waste because of all the waste
 
04:12:13.469 --> 04:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
water that does come from that Reverse
 
04:12:15.790 --> 04:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
Osmosis System uh but there may be
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who's already mitigated that of
 
04:12:19.510 --> 04:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
the incoming water from their well and
 
04:12:21.070 --> 04:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
they may have other reasons why they
 
04:12:23.429 --> 04:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
prefer to do that um so forcing somebody
 
04:12:24.670 --> 04:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
to do that when they may have already
 
04:12:26.670 --> 04:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
mitigated the problem I don't think
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate however an
 
04:12:31.349 --> 04:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
information campaign if it is coming
 
04:12:33.510 --> 04:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
because of a contamination issue would
 
04:12:35.670 --> 04:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
be very important and quite frankly I'd
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
probably be going by with some cookie
 
04:12:39.910 --> 04:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
some brownies baked with bottled water
 
04:12:41.429 --> 04:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
and making sure all my neighbors knew
 
04:12:43.830 --> 04:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
about the risk uh because it is a real
 
04:12:46.149 --> 04:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
risk and I appreciate that and actually
 
04:12:48.269 --> 04:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
and sorry if I go go back to rep
 
04:12:50.710 --> 04:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
corman's um question it actually says
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
that any customer of a public water util
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
on lines um 10 11 12 uh through 13 that
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
actually references the statutes um
 
04:13:03.590 --> 04:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
about the requirements for the septic
 
04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
system so that's a reference to the rsas
 
04:13:08.429 --> 04:13:08.439 align:start position:0%
that cover the septic
 
04:13:11.189 --> 04:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
systems so if you're not able to meet
 
04:13:13.309 --> 04:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
the requirements or meet a waiver that's
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
been accepted by Dees then you would not
 
04:13:19.109 --> 04:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:21.309 --> 04:13:21.319 align:start position:0%
connection representative Harrington has
 
04:13:22.830 --> 04:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
a question thank you and thank you for
 
04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I noticed you've uh
 
04:13:27.910 --> 04:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
specifically talk about public utilities
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
or Municipal corporation uh would this
 
04:13:33.550 --> 04:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
apply to private water systems for
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
example someone puts in a condominium
 
04:13:39.070 --> 04:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
development and they may have their own
 
04:13:42.149 --> 04:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
private water system or or same thing
 
04:13:44.030 --> 04:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
with surage for that matter so it's not
 
04:13:46.790 --> 04:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
a public utility because it's owned by
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
the uh members of the U you know
 
04:13:51.229 --> 04:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
Cooperative whatever whatever that
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
happened to be called it's also been
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
done in housing developments where
 
04:13:57.469 --> 04:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
someone will put in uh you know 10 or 12
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
houses someplace and they'll have a
 
04:14:01.469 --> 04:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
central well for all of them because
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's cheaper than putting in 12 Wells uh
 
04:14:06.030 --> 04:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
so would that be affected by this or
 
04:14:08.349 --> 04:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
would this be only Public Utilities or
 
04:14:11.389 --> 04:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
Municipal owned uh corporations well um
 
04:14:13.030 --> 04:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question that's an
 
04:14:14.790 --> 04:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
area that I hadn't looked at quite as
 
04:14:17.149 --> 04:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
closely in a condominium situation or
 
04:14:19.109 --> 04:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
something else where you've been able to
 
04:14:21.149 --> 04:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
change the zoning requirements so you
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
can have people more densely packed in
 
04:14:24.790 --> 04:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
one section of the property and leave
 
04:14:28.550 --> 04:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
others open space um there are some ways
 
04:14:31.030 --> 04:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
that those water and septic systems
 
04:14:32.309 --> 04:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
because sometimes there are larger
 
04:14:33.950 --> 04:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
septic systems the way that they're
 
04:14:36.830 --> 04:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
handled are actually pull from that
 
04:14:39.189 --> 04:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
large larger area of land underneath the
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
property in order to cover the space
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
needed for it sorry it's been a while
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
since I looked at this I was an
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
architecture minor I want to develop
 
04:14:49.550 --> 04:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
stuff I I love all of this so excuse me
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
if I get a little bit on the surface of
 
04:14:52.910 --> 04:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
these so when you when you get to some
 
04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
of those approvals for those um
 
04:14:57.630 --> 04:14:57.640 align:start position:0%
congregate Wells and congregate septics
 
04:14:59.830 --> 04:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
some of those already sort of block off
 
04:15:01.550 --> 04:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
a Zone about what would be acceptable
 
04:15:05.149 --> 04:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
for any other well um I I would think
 
04:15:07.389 --> 04:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
that in a private situation it may make
 
04:15:09.109 --> 04:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
sense to do that within the agreements
 
04:15:12.269 --> 04:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
of your private um private organization
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and that's not one that I had looked
 
04:15:15.990 --> 04:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
too closely into
 
04:15:18.149 --> 04:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
followup follow up yeah what I'm trying
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
to get at is let's just say there was a
 
04:15:22.070 --> 04:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
private agreement and then you're living
 
04:15:23.630 --> 04:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
there and then you decide you want to
 
04:15:26.349 --> 04:15:26.359 align:start position:0%
put in your own well or whatever so you
 
04:15:28.750 --> 04:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
say I want to disconnect would this law
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
allow you to do that and would this say
 
04:15:32.070 --> 04:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
this doesn't apply because you're not a
 
04:15:33.870 --> 04:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
public utility or Municipal owned
 
04:15:36.269 --> 04:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
Corporation um I'd be happy if you
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to add that amendment to it okay
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
I know that I don't join I don't move
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
live anywhere that has those agreements
 
04:15:43.950 --> 04:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
because my mother's um condo in
 
04:15:45.670 --> 04:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
California refused to get earthquake
 
04:15:48.109 --> 04:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
insurance and those consequences follow
 
04:15:48.119 --> 04:15:51.030 align:start position:0%
insurance and those consequences follow
everybody

04:15:51.030 --> 04:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:54.510 --> 04:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
else um before we get to some other
 
04:15:56.309 --> 04:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
questions and there are other questions
 
04:15:58.790 --> 04:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
I just need a quick clarification if you
 
04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
could please this bill modifies RSA
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
62 which is the limited electrical
 
04:16:06.600 --> 04:16:07.550 align:start position:0%
62 which is the limited electrical
producer

04:16:07.550 --> 04:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
producer
 
04:16:07.560 --> 04:16:10.469 align:start position:0%
producer
users

04:16:10.469 --> 04:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
users
 
04:16:13.389 --> 04:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
Act and the focus of that act is mostly
 
04:16:15.189 --> 04:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
on electric
 
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
electricity uh
 
04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
issues the legislation that governs
 
04:16:26.790 --> 04:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
sewers is RSA 49- I do you think this
 
04:16:29.790 --> 04:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
legislation might more properly reside
 
04:16:34.189 --> 04:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
under uh 149 I as opposed to
 
04:16:36.510 --> 04:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
362 um yes I think that probably would
 
04:16:38.790 --> 04:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
be a much better fit um and I apologize
 
04:16:41.750 --> 04:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
I was reaching beyond my core areas
 
04:16:44.670 --> 04:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
where I can St spout the rsas and thank
 
04:16:46.590 --> 04:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
you for catching that um I think it
 
04:16:48.630 --> 04:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
would belong much better in this than
 
04:16:49.510 --> 04:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:16:51.510 --> 04:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
clarification okay next up is
 
04:16:54.349 --> 04:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you Mr chair
 
04:16:56.990 --> 04:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
04:17:01.469 --> 04:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
if if someone opts out of um service
 
04:17:06.189 --> 04:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
from any utility water sewer or electric
 
04:17:08.229 --> 04:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
does there need to be some kind of hold
 
04:17:10.109 --> 04:17:10.119 align:start position:0%
harmless provision that protects the
 
04:17:13.070 --> 04:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
utility from any claims that that that
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
individual might make in the invent of
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
an emergency where they all of a sudden
 
04:17:20.030 --> 04:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
want to have be connected to the grid
 
04:17:22.229 --> 04:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
you know the next
 
04:17:24.830 --> 04:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
day well um thank you for that question
 
04:17:27.309 --> 04:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
I I would believe that any contract that
 
04:17:28.790 --> 04:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
you have for somebody opting out should
 
04:17:31.109 --> 04:17:31.119 align:start position:0%
have that hold harmless um so if that's
 
04:17:32.189 --> 04:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
something that you wanted to add to the
 
04:17:34.269 --> 04:17:34.279 align:start position:0%
bill I would absolutely appreciate that
 
04:17:35.790 --> 04:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
this does say that in the future
 
04:17:37.790 --> 04:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants to connect it
 
04:17:39.070 --> 04:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
basically lays out that there already
 
04:17:41.389 --> 04:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
would be a proscribed process for that
 
04:17:43.429 --> 04:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
and I was envisioning more somebody who
 
04:17:44.990 --> 04:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
either because they had gotten very old
 
04:17:46.590 --> 04:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
and didn't want to maintain it maybe
 
04:17:48.269 --> 04:17:48.279 align:start position:0%
they had somebody who had family issues
 
04:17:49.710 --> 04:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
where they didn't or they sold it to
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who was really excited about
 
04:17:53.670 --> 04:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
not having to deal with a septic system
 
04:17:56.070 --> 04:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
and that future owner wanted to connect
 
04:17:59.149 --> 04:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
but uh because it does allow for a
 
04:18:01.109 --> 04:18:01.119 align:start position:0%
already prescribed procedure for
 
04:18:03.510 --> 04:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
somebody to return to that system or
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
join the system in the first time I
 
04:18:07.630 --> 04:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
would expect that that would be included
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
in that process so that nobody nobody
 
04:18:12.269 --> 04:18:12.279 align:start position:0%
can have any an expectation of snapping
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
their fingers and having Serv Services
 
04:18:17.790 --> 04:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:20.070 --> 04:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
reality representative Corman has a
 
04:18:22.269 --> 04:18:22.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you again and thank you
 
04:18:24.670 --> 04:18:24.680 align:start position:0%
again uh I'd like to ask about par uh
 
04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph 4 uh on page two lines 6
 
04:18:27.600 --> 04:18:29.229 align:start position:0%
paragraph 4 uh on page two lines 6
through

04:18:29.229 --> 04:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:18:33.910 --> 04:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
13 and I'm a little unclear on exactly
 
04:18:36.309 --> 04:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh how this would apply so I'm imagining
 
04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
there's a street and several homeowners
 
04:18:44.030 --> 04:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
decide to opt out and the utility says
 
04:18:45.550 --> 04:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
no we're going to connect to you and
 
04:18:49.710 --> 04:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
therefore this um this fine would apply
 
04:18:51.870 --> 04:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
would it apply just once or would it
 
04:18:56.429 --> 04:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:58.349 --> 04:18:58.359 align:start position:0%
homeowner um so thank you for the
 
04:19:02.109 --> 04:19:02.119 align:start position:0%
question the way that I had intended it
 
04:19:04.630 --> 04:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
um it says to the property owner but if
 
04:19:06.269 --> 04:19:06.279 align:start position:0%
there was a class action that that may
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
make sense as well the reason why when I
 
04:19:10.950 --> 04:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
was discussing it there was a cap on it
 
04:19:12.550 --> 04:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
would just be to make sure that you
 
04:19:13.750 --> 04:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a bunch of different
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
people coming in and essentially
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
bankrupting it because um they were
 
04:19:19.389 --> 04:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
going through the process because if
 
04:19:21.950 --> 04:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
there was a situation where somebody was
 
04:19:24.389 --> 04:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
told that in order to connect in you
 
04:19:27.269 --> 04:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
would need to tear up a new roaded um it
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
would then need to connect in and then
 
04:19:29.870 --> 04:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
you would need to pay for a
 
04:19:31.630 --> 04:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
reconstruction of that road bed in order
 
04:19:34.109 --> 04:19:34.119 align:start position:0%
to do that that would be prohibitive and
 
04:19:36.189 --> 04:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
that's why there's an intention to allow
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
to have have a spur in that sort of
 
04:19:41.309 --> 04:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
situation that the homeowner could um
 
04:19:43.309 --> 04:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
could be charged for that spur to then
 
04:19:45.109 --> 04:19:45.119 align:start position:0%
connect to in the future because you
 
04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
need to be able to account for the
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
situation where it's a road where it's
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
not a problem tapping it in or if it's a
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
larger Road where you actually would
 
04:19:53.870 --> 04:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
have infrastructure problems with
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
tapping in in the future and to be able
 
04:19:58.510 --> 04:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
to allow those processes for them to set
 
04:20:01.469 --> 04:20:01.479 align:start position:0%
around a project what the if there's any
 
04:20:04.710 --> 04:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
opt out cost because there is a value to
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
a future homeowner being able to tap
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
into that into that system and I
 
04:20:10.630 --> 04:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
understand the idea of charging a
 
04:20:12.550 --> 04:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
certain amount because it is CH passing
 
04:20:14.790 --> 04:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
in front of you and so that you don't
 
04:20:17.269 --> 04:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
have to pay to fix that roaded issue if
 
04:20:19.469 --> 04:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
you're tapping in that's why having an
 
04:20:21.750 --> 04:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
ability to have a Spur like they do in
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
other areas that you would Connect into
 
04:20:25.149 --> 04:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
that is past the improved edge of the
 
04:20:27.670 --> 04:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
road is something that to me seemed like
 
04:20:29.429 --> 04:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
a reasonable offering where then the
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
homeowner is responsible from that point
 
04:20:33.229 --> 04:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
to the to the rest of the way to the
 
04:20:35.229 --> 04:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
house I'm trying to find a way where
 
04:20:36.910 --> 04:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
it's fair to people who are opting out
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
fair to those who are opting in in the
 
04:20:39.950 --> 04:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
future and fair to those rate payers who
 
04:20:41.950 --> 04:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
are still on there because if somebody's
 
04:20:43.510 --> 04:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
going to preserve an option when it's
 
04:20:46.590 --> 04:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
going down say the new Exit 4 a perhaps
 
04:20:48.630 --> 04:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's a cost so that in the future you
 
04:20:51.109 --> 04:20:51.119 align:start position:0%
can tie in but it also shouldn't be that
 
04:20:53.109 --> 04:20:53.119 align:start position:0%
ongoing obligation and forcing you to
 
04:20:55.469 --> 04:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
leave a A system that you appreciate and
 
04:20:58.870 --> 04:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
that you enjoy followup yeah thank you
 
04:21:00.389 --> 04:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
I'm still just trying to wrap my head
 
04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
around um the the fine issue here
 
04:21:07.950 --> 04:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
so let's imagine that there are two
 
04:21:09.550 --> 04:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
different locations that the same
 
04:21:11.950 --> 04:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
utility is serving and that there are
 
04:21:14.189 --> 04:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
multiple homeowners on at both those
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
locations and that the utility is is
 
04:21:20.670 --> 04:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
doing the wrong thing is this
 
04:21:23.710 --> 04:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
250,000 just that's a
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
lifetime uh cap for the utility or is it
 
04:21:29.710 --> 04:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
250,000 per neighborhood per homeowner
 
04:21:30.910 --> 04:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to understanding
 
04:21:33.030 --> 04:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
get clarity on because I find that this
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
language doesn't tell me well I mean
 
04:21:36.950 --> 04:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
my my expectation as thought is that
 
04:21:41.870 --> 04:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
they would be following the statutes and
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
by having an enforcement provision that
 
04:21:45.269 --> 04:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
is simply there in order to make sure
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
that good people continue to make good
 
04:21:49.710 --> 04:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
decisions I'd frankly have a much larger
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
concern if we had um if we had the
 
04:21:54.510 --> 04:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
systems routinely making decisions that
 
04:21:56.670 --> 04:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
were in violation of statutes and I
 
04:21:57.830 --> 04:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
think that would be an indication of a
 
04:22:00.189 --> 04:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
far larger problem quite frankly so I
 
04:22:02.189 --> 04:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
recognize your concern but I don't think
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
that they would be acting in such a
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
reckless way so I don't think that it
 
04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
actually would be a would be a problem
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
in in in actual
 
04:22:13.309 --> 04:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
practice representative McGee has a
 
04:22:15.469 --> 04:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:22:18.870 --> 04:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
again okay so I'm on section three of
 
04:22:23.349 --> 04:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
the bill and uh Parts A and B uh were of
 
04:22:25.990 --> 04:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
interest to me so a says that all new
 
04:22:29.070 --> 04:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
residential electric gas water or sewer
 
04:22:31.630 --> 04:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
projects must detail how the core
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
project cost and individual property
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
connection costs are calculated
 
04:22:39.950 --> 04:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
and provide for payment in full and
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
delayed payment including the mechanism
 
04:22:44.910 --> 04:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
to determine the cost for property
 
04:22:48.109 --> 04:22:48.119 align:start position:0%
owners to connect in later years and um
 
04:22:50.109 --> 04:22:50.119 align:start position:0%
then it talks about how people can
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
structure their payments um from
 
04:22:55.510 --> 04:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
Property Owners uh and allow different
 
04:22:58.030 --> 04:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
methods for payment but when I think
 
04:23:00.309 --> 04:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
about the reality of how developments
 
04:23:05.229 --> 04:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
are going up for example um in my area
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
many times uh a developer will be
 
04:23:10.950 --> 04:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
proposing a development plan of 50
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
houses 30 houses um and so their costs
 
04:23:19.229 --> 04:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
may be the same for all the houses in
 
04:23:21.710 --> 04:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
their development but they're uh
 
04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
projected based on them knowing that
 
04:23:25.469 --> 04:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
they're going to be running gas or
 
04:23:27.910 --> 04:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
whatever system for heating for all of
 
04:23:30.510 --> 04:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
them water sewer obviously they have to
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
provide for it to be habitable um so I
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
don't understand how this will work if
 
04:23:39.750 --> 04:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh a mandate that all new
 
04:23:42.109 --> 04:23:42.119 align:start position:0%
residential electric gas water and sewer
 
04:23:44.990 --> 04:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
projects now have to have this opt out
 
04:23:46.389 --> 04:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
if you want to because many times when
 
04:23:48.389 --> 04:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
they're building them they have to spec
 
04:23:50.429 --> 04:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
for all of those systems and they don't
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
know who's going to buy them so I don't
 
04:23:54.309 --> 04:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
I don't understand how it would work in
 
04:23:56.309 --> 04:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
practice well thank you for the question
 
04:23:58.030 --> 04:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
who's the owner of the development while
 
04:24:00.710 --> 04:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
these services are provided well it's
 
04:24:02.269 --> 04:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
new construction so it would be the
 
04:24:04.710 --> 04:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
developer who's the owner correct y so
 
04:24:06.429 --> 04:24:06.439 align:start position:0%
the developer would would make that
 
04:24:08.429 --> 04:24:08.439 align:start position:0%
choice to connect most likely make that
 
04:24:10.030 --> 04:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
choice to connect everybody to that
 
04:24:12.550 --> 04:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
system and it would take further action
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
for somebody to be able to get an
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
approved septic design and be able to
 
04:24:19.269 --> 04:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
get an approved well when they're
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
already tied in in a development that
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
already provides it so the likelihood
 
04:24:25.790 --> 04:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
that somebody who would want to move to
 
04:24:28.030 --> 04:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
a new development and then pay the cost
 
04:24:30.389 --> 04:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
of a septic system and a well when
 
04:24:32.149 --> 04:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
there's already water going to it is
 
04:24:35.550 --> 04:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
very low um I I own property that could
 
04:24:37.750 --> 04:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
potentially be developed into quite a
 
04:24:40.149 --> 04:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
few homes um I'm trying to preserve that
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
forest and that land but I also have a
 
04:24:44.149 --> 04:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
lot of neighbors that if I were to do
 
04:24:46.269 --> 04:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
that and if everybody who was passed by
 
04:24:48.030 --> 04:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
the septic and water was forced to
 
04:24:50.349 --> 04:24:50.359 align:start position:0%
connect they would have a major change
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
in how they ran their homes and I want
 
04:24:53.910 --> 04:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that whether I'm that
 
04:24:55.990 --> 04:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
developer or somebody else's those
 
04:24:57.750 --> 04:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
people who are passed by the water and
 
04:25:00.830 --> 04:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
SE and Sewer in on their way to go serve
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
that new development aren't forced to
 
04:25:04.950 --> 04:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
join the system if they don't want to
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
and if they already have a good good
 
04:25:08.309 --> 04:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
balance with nature in their home and in
 
04:25:08.319 --> 04:25:10.030 align:start position:0%
balance with nature in their home and in
their

04:25:10.030 --> 04:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:25:13.550 --> 04:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
property okay I further questions yeah I
 
04:25:15.189 --> 04:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
just I don't know of any scenarios where
 
04:25:17.429 --> 04:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
that where anyone who has a a septic and
 
04:25:19.950 --> 04:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
well would be required to take a
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
different Source usually if you're
 
04:25:23.469 --> 04:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
already selfcontained nobody's going to
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
force you change we're here to ask
 
04:25:28.269 --> 04:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
questions any further
 
04:25:30.349 --> 04:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I want to thank
 
04:25:32.349 --> 04:25:32.359 align:start position:0%
you for introducing this legislation to
 
04:25:34.109 --> 04:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
us there actually was a bit of a
 
04:25:35.630 --> 04:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
question in that there was a project
 
04:25:37.510 --> 04:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
that required ired full optin in Dairy
 
04:25:39.429 --> 04:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
in order for it to proceed and anybody
 
04:25:40.950 --> 04:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
who who was against it still would have
 
04:25:42.870 --> 04:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
been forced to participate in that sewer
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
SE system and water system so it would
 
04:25:47.229 --> 04:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
have been a majority vote the majority
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
did not vote for that septic sewer and
 
04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
water so it did not happen but it would
 
04:25:52.149 --> 04:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
have happened regardless for those who
 
04:25:56.149 --> 04:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
did not want to participate so thank
 
04:25:58.870 --> 04:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions we
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
want to thank you representative for
 
04:26:03.070 --> 04:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
introducing this proposed legislation
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and next we would like to hear
 
04:26:07.510 --> 04:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:26:09.349 --> 04:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services so I'd like to
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
invite Tracy
 
04:26:17.309 --> 04:26:17.319 align:start position:0%

Kernan kernin okay not a lot of space on
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
these pink cards to write names so sorry
 
04:26:30.590 --> 04:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
if I got that wrong but apologize to you
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
no that Miss Wood it's great to see you
 
04:26:34.229 --> 04:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
it's been a while since I've seen you
 
04:26:35.830 --> 04:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
and it's nice to have you uh have you
 
04:26:38.710 --> 04:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
back back thank you good to see
 
04:26:41.710 --> 04:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
you so thank you for having us chairman
 
04:26:44.670 --> 04:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee uh de has
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
submitted a letter of testimony I don't
 
04:26:49.550 --> 04:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
know if it's made its way around um but
 
04:26:52.990 --> 04:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Dees opposes this bill um
 
04:26:56.229 --> 04:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to the Sewer side my name is
 
04:26:58.109 --> 04:26:58.119 align:start position:0%
Tracy wood and I'm the administrator of
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
the Wastewater engineering Bureau at D
 
04:27:03.229 --> 04:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
and Brandon kernin who is the
 
04:27:04.630 --> 04:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
administrator of the drinking water and
 
04:27:06.269 --> 04:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
groundwater Bureau will speak
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
specifically to drinking water um so on
 
04:27:12.590 --> 04:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
the sewer piece um we oppose it because
 
04:27:16.189 --> 04:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
it conflicts with existing statutes so
 
04:27:20.870 --> 04:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
the main statute RSA 1478 requires that
 
04:27:22.830 --> 04:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
if you're going to occupy a building
 
04:27:25.790 --> 04:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
that you need to have public or access
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
to public water and sewer or you can
 
04:27:31.109 --> 04:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
have for sewer a private septic system
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
as well but you need to have proper
 
04:27:37.070 --> 04:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
sewage and water facilities
 
04:27:40.429 --> 04:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
that RSA also requires that if you're
 
04:27:42.429 --> 04:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
within 100 feet of the sewer you as
 
04:27:43.950 --> 04:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
you've heard today that you need to
 
04:27:45.109 --> 04:27:45.119 align:start position:0%
connect to
 
04:27:48.269 --> 04:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
that stepping back a little bit back to
 
04:27:51.630 --> 04:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
the Clean Water Act 50 years ago when we
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
came when they built all the wastewater
 
04:27:56.070 --> 04:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities in New Hampshire
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
and specifically to the RSA that you
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
cited which is 149 I um that's specific
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
to sewer use ordinances and so each
 
04:28:07.389 --> 04:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
community that built a wastewater
 
04:28:09.630 --> 04:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
treatment plant was required to also
 
04:28:12.389 --> 04:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
have a sewer use ordinance which defines
 
04:28:16.750 --> 04:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
on how that sewer utility is run so in
 
04:28:20.670 --> 04:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
that there is an option for any
 
04:28:25.510 --> 04:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
person to um ask for a waiver from that
 
04:28:27.550 --> 04:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
100 foot requirement to have to connect
 
04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
in and my experience in New Hampshire
 
04:28:33.910 --> 04:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
with most communities is is that if
 
04:28:35.790 --> 04:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
there is an established public super
 
04:28:39.309 --> 04:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
sewer system and they're expanding and
 
04:28:41.550 --> 04:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
there are properties that have currently
 
04:28:44.189 --> 04:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
private septic systems the majority of
 
04:28:46.510 --> 04:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
the time they do not require that they
 
04:28:49.109 --> 04:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
connect until their septic system
 
04:28:52.229 --> 04:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
actually fails so if you have a properly
 
04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
functioning and working septic system
 
04:28:56.510 --> 04:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
you do not have to connect until it
 
04:28:58.389 --> 04:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
fails and then they would like you to
 
04:29:01.269 --> 04:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
connect instead of building another
 
04:29:05.030 --> 04:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
septic system so we oppose because it
 
04:29:07.229 --> 04:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
conflicts with existing statutes it
 
04:29:09.630 --> 04:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
erodes local Authority who have
 
04:29:11.030 --> 04:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
established the guidelines for
 
04:29:13.750 --> 04:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
connecting and they have a process to
 
04:29:16.189 --> 04:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
opt out through their waiver process
 
04:29:17.910 --> 04:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
each Community does things a little bit
 
04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
differently in in New Hampshire we have
 
04:29:23.070 --> 04:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
local control local sewer use ordinances
 
04:29:24.670 --> 04:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
so I'll turn it over to Brandon for
 
04:29:24.680 --> 04:29:27.229 align:start position:0%
so I'll turn it over to Brandon for
drinking

04:29:27.229 --> 04:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:29.790 --> 04:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
water um good afternoon Brandon kernin
 
04:29:30.750 --> 04:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrator of the drinking
 
04:29:32.189 --> 04:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
water and groundwater Bureau and I just
 
04:29:33.950 --> 04:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
want to express some concerns about this
 
04:29:35.429 --> 04:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
bill relative to groundwater and
 
04:29:38.149 --> 04:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
drinking drinking water protection um
 
04:29:40.710 --> 04:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
first of all um as explained in the bill
 
04:29:43.149 --> 04:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
already an entity a homeowner can opt
 
04:29:45.389 --> 04:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
out of a water system if they're able to
 
04:29:48.109 --> 04:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
site a well that meets our well sighting
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
and Wastewater disposal requirements
 
04:29:54.070 --> 04:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
what house bill 1576 would do though is
 
04:29:57.269 --> 04:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
introduce a waiver and even suggest that
 
04:30:00.189 --> 04:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
you could monitor other people's um
 
04:30:02.830 --> 04:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality if you can't meet
 
04:30:04.389 --> 04:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
those requirements so you could put a
 
04:30:08.070 --> 04:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
well in septic system in closer to Wells
 
04:30:10.870 --> 04:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
than what our regulations allow now and
 
04:30:13.269 --> 04:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
and as an offset monitor water quality
 
04:30:15.309 --> 04:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
to see if anything goes bad we think
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's pretty risky and it's also really
 
04:30:19.510 --> 04:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
unmanageable for the dees how would we
 
04:30:21.670 --> 04:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
be able to track all these site specific
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
waivers and we certainly aren't funded
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
for that type of activity right now um
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
another concern is uh with the bill is
 
04:30:31.109 --> 04:30:31.119 align:start position:0%
that it would require when there's new
 
04:30:33.189 --> 04:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
water line that there be access points
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
or main stops or curb stops put in for
 
04:30:38.990 --> 04:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
each property as the water line um
 
04:30:41.630 --> 04:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
proceeds and while that is proactive and
 
04:30:43.710 --> 04:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
trying to think about how to be very
 
04:30:46.710 --> 04:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
efficient penetrating a water man is
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
more than you need to is one of the last
 
04:30:50.710 --> 04:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
things you want to do it creates a weak
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
point an area where leakage would occur
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
or more likely and and even with the
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
valves um where those would need
 
04:30:59.830 --> 04:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance over time um tapping a a
 
04:31:02.309 --> 04:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
water main is a routine activity and so
 
04:31:03.590 --> 04:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
while it's proactive to think about
 
04:31:05.269 --> 04:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
putting these in water systems are fine
 
04:31:07.630 --> 04:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
with putting them in on a case-by casee
 
04:31:09.990 --> 04:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
basis opposed to just doing it for every
 
04:31:11.870 --> 04:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
property and the last thing I just point
 
04:31:13.229 --> 04:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
out is that the fine is pretty
 
04:31:16.109 --> 04:31:16.119 align:start position:0%
significant for these Water Systems um
 
04:31:18.189 --> 04:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
these water systems are either run by
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
elected officials or or regulated by by
 
04:31:23.149 --> 04:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
Department of energy Public Utilities
 
04:31:24.269 --> 04:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
Commission and there's lots of
 
04:31:26.229 --> 04:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the public to intervene
 
04:31:28.309 --> 04:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
and provide input and change things if
 
04:31:29.710 --> 04:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
they don't like the rules of that
 
04:31:29.720 --> 04:31:30.630 align:start position:0%
they don't like the rules of that
specific

04:31:30.630 --> 04:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:31:34.030 --> 04:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
utility that I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
questions Vice chair Thomas has
 
04:31:38.349 --> 04:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
questions for you thank you thank you Mr
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank for thank you for taking
 
04:31:44.269 --> 04:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
my question so um just out of curiosity
 
04:31:45.670 --> 04:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would there be is there is
 
04:31:51.510 --> 04:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
there a mechanism a reasonable mechanism
 
04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
for someone to live off the grid if they
 
04:31:57.070 --> 04:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
if they so chose wherever they wanted
 
04:31:59.590 --> 04:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
to they could live off the grid and if
 
04:32:02.590 --> 04:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't have pressurized water that
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
or waste water then they wouldn't need
 
04:32:08.189 --> 04:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
these approvals um if they wanted to
 
04:32:10.229 --> 04:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
have pressurized water supply to a
 
04:32:11.349 --> 04:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
building that they were in then they
 
04:32:12.710 --> 04:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
would have to comply with our well
 
04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
sighting and waste water disposal
 
04:32:16.870 --> 04:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
requirements so
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
follow follow up okay so in effect then
 
04:32:24.550 --> 04:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
if someone did want to live off the grid
 
04:32:27.070 --> 04:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
they would be limited to where they
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
could live off the
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
grid correct they if they wanted a water
 
04:32:34.990 --> 04:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
supply and a Wastewater Disposal system
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
they would have to to comply with State
 
04:32:42.830 --> 04:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:45.269 --> 04:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
regulations I I just like to add I'm not
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
sure what you mean by I I know what you
 
04:32:48.670 --> 04:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
mean by live off the grid but live off
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
the grid that they don't have any access
 
04:32:54.109 --> 04:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
to water or sewer or I mean because to
 
04:32:56.710 --> 04:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
live to occupy a dwelling you would need
 
04:32:59.590 --> 04:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
a a building occupancy permit from any
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
Community you can't
 
04:33:05.789 --> 04:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
just live occupy a property have a
 
04:33:08.470 --> 04:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
building without proper public or water
 
04:33:10.230 --> 04:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
and sewer can be private you can have a
 
04:33:11.510 --> 04:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
private septic
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
system she say
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
me go ahead and answer it then well I
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure but what what your your
 
04:33:22.830 --> 04:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
question seems to imply
 
04:33:26.470 --> 04:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
that uh somebody would have to get
 
04:33:29.551 --> 04:33:29.561 align:start position:0%
special permission from the state if
 
04:33:32.189 --> 04:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
they wanted to live off the grid is what
 
04:33:33.789 --> 04:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
your question is kind of implying that
 
04:33:35.590 --> 04:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
then I wouldn't say from the state I
 
04:33:38.070 --> 04:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
would say from the local town the town
 
04:33:40.029 --> 04:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
would have because you would need an
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
occupancy permit for a your property for
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
your building um and in order to get
 
04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
that you have to have water and sewer
 
04:33:50.990 --> 04:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
access to Water and Sewer I just
 
04:33:52.709 --> 04:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
reiterate there are some communities at
 
04:33:54.189 --> 04:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
least there were last time I looked that
 
04:33:56.629 --> 04:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
don't require occupancy permits so
 
04:33:58.150 --> 04:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
they'd be probably easy to live off the
 
04:33:59.629 --> 04:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
grid if you didn't want pressurized
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
water waste water and lived in a town
 
04:34:04.070 --> 04:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
that didn't require that
 
04:34:06.551 --> 04:34:06.561 align:start position:0%
permit okay thank
 
04:34:09.470 --> 04:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
you representative Bernardi has a
 
04:34:13.150 --> 04:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman so uh I'm
 
04:34:15.189 --> 04:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
GNA approach this from a from a
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
different angle my understanding of the
 
04:34:22.949 --> 04:34:22.959 align:start position:0%
desire of this bill is that you live in
 
04:34:26.029 --> 04:34:26.039 align:start position:0%
a community you have a well you have
 
04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
sewer on your own your own
 
04:34:31.910 --> 04:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
septic now down the road that you live
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
on someone's putting a development in
 
04:34:37.230 --> 04:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
down the road Road they're going to run
 
04:34:40.750 --> 04:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
a sewer line and a water line across the
 
04:34:43.230 --> 04:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
front of your property to get to that
 
04:34:46.349 --> 04:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
new development because you are on that
 
04:34:49.230 --> 04:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
road they're going to now make you
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
abandon your well abandon your sewer and
 
04:34:52.561 --> 04:34:53.709 align:start position:0%
abandon your well abandon your sewer and
sign

04:34:53.709 --> 04:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
sign
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
up that's what this thing I this this
 
04:34:59.470 --> 04:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
legislation is trying to say no we need
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
to fix that state law that requires that
 
04:35:04.789 --> 04:35:04.799 align:start position:0%
and not require that are you opposing
 
04:35:07.709 --> 04:35:07.719 align:start position:0%
that principal or
 
04:35:12.429 --> 04:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
not state law RSA 149 I requires each
 
04:35:15.830 --> 04:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
town to have a local sewer use ordinance
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
so the statute requires the sewer use
 
04:35:20.629 --> 04:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
ordinance the town develops their own
 
04:35:24.310 --> 04:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
sewer use ordinance and that is approved
 
04:35:25.949 --> 04:35:25.959 align:start position:0%
through their their town meeting
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
approval process or it has been
 
04:35:32.429 --> 04:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
so it is up to that town whether they
 
04:35:37.869 --> 04:35:37.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so the principle I'm
 
04:35:44.429 --> 04:35:44.439 align:start position:0%
asking is shouldn't the state be law be
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
changed to not allow the town to mandate
 
04:35:51.150 --> 04:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
that new line coming down in front of my
 
04:35:54.269 --> 04:35:54.279 align:start position:0%
house all you know I'm on three acres
 
04:35:57.230 --> 04:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
everything's fine I don't need a uh I
 
04:35:59.590 --> 04:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
don't need to sign up for the system but
 
04:36:02.029 --> 04:36:02.039 align:start position:0%
that development down the street is
 
04:36:03.949 --> 04:36:03.959 align:start position:0%
causing those lines to be run shouldn't
 
04:36:06.551 --> 04:36:06.561 align:start position:0%
the state law say the town can't do that
 
04:36:06.561 --> 04:36:07.750 align:start position:0%
the state law say the town can't do that
to

04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:36:12.189 --> 04:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
me I guess my opinion would be do we
 
04:36:15.629 --> 04:36:15.639 align:start position:0%
want the state telling towns about their
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
towns each town is unique and they may
 
04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
have their own individual reasons for
 
04:36:24.510 --> 04:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
requiring things you know there's
 
04:36:25.709 --> 04:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
certain communities that are dealing
 
04:36:28.750 --> 04:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
with P contamination and they may have a
 
04:36:30.470 --> 04:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
valid reason for wanting people to
 
04:36:32.670 --> 04:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
connect to the Sewer um there's
 
04:36:35.070 --> 04:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
communities that um have to abide by the
 
04:36:37.551 --> 04:36:37.561 align:start position:0%
Great Bay total nitrogen General permit
 
04:36:39.910 --> 04:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
um there's the ms4 permit there are all
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
these permits out there and that are
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
unique to each individual community and
 
04:36:47.789 --> 04:36:47.799 align:start position:0%
I think my opinion would be that I the
 
04:36:49.629 --> 04:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
local community should be deciding
 
04:36:52.470 --> 04:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
what's best for their Community Based on
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
all of the requirements that they have
 
04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
to meet knowing exactly what's going on
 
04:36:59.910 --> 04:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
in their Community my experience has
 
04:37:02.349 --> 04:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
been in that particular
 
04:37:05.990 --> 04:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
circumstance it is rare that a community
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
would require someone to connect just
 
04:37:11.830 --> 04:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
cuz they're running by on the sewer side
 
04:37:13.789 --> 04:37:13.799 align:start position:0%
they would say if you have a functioning
 
04:37:13.799 --> 04:37:15.510 align:start position:0%
they would say if you have a functioning
septic

04:37:15.510 --> 04:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
septic
 
04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
system you can keep that but once your
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
septic system fails we're going to
 
04:37:23.470 --> 04:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
require you to connect if you're within
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
100 ft now because it's a local sewer
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
use ordinance communities can decide
 
04:37:31.230 --> 04:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
they can make that distance longer some
 
04:37:34.990 --> 04:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
can say 200 ft some may say 300 ft it's
 
04:37:37.230 --> 04:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
it's up to that individual Community as
 
04:37:40.390 --> 04:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
require representative lii has a
 
04:37:44.750 --> 04:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:37:47.670 --> 04:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um since this is
 
04:37:50.349 --> 04:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
new legislation would it not supersede
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
the uh statute that you quote here it be
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
an addendum to them because it's it
 
04:37:56.639 --> 04:38:00.349 align:start position:0%
an addendum to them because it's it
would

04:38:00.349 --> 04:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.470 --> 04:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
supersede I am definitely not a lawyer
 
04:38:06.949 --> 04:38:06.959 align:start position:0%
and I I would recommend that you get um
 
04:38:11.629 --> 04:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
an opinion on that um but the the
 
04:38:15.029 --> 04:38:15.039 align:start position:0%
RSA that it's referencing is has nothing
 
04:38:18.429 --> 04:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
to do with sewers so it's the wrong RSA
 
04:38:21.310 --> 04:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
so I think you'd have to correct the RSA
 
04:38:24.750 --> 04:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
to supersede the actual
 
04:38:28.109 --> 04:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
RSA representative reos has a question
 
04:38:31.990 --> 04:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um your um de's
 
04:38:32.000 --> 04:38:33.310 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um your um de's
written

04:38:33.310 --> 04:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:38:36.990 --> 04:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
testimony um talks somewhat extensively
 
04:38:39.910 --> 04:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
about how the
 
04:38:39.920 --> 04:38:41.429 align:start position:0%
about how the
economics

04:38:41.429 --> 04:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
economics
 
04:38:45.990 --> 04:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
of public Municipal Water Systems and
 
04:38:48.551 --> 04:38:48.561 align:start position:0%
sewer systems
 
04:38:51.310 --> 04:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
are premised or
 
04:38:51.320 --> 04:38:52.990 align:start position:0%
are premised or
calculated

04:38:52.990 --> 04:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
calculated
 
04:38:55.869 --> 04:38:55.879 align:start position:0%
uh both from a capital investment
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
perspective and also from an operating
 
04:39:01.070 --> 04:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
perspective so Capital costs would be
 
04:39:04.869 --> 04:39:04.879 align:start position:0%
about the bond amount and the repayments
 
04:39:06.830 --> 04:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
SCH for the bond and and operating would
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
be about the rates that all the
 
04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
customers pay um this bill seeks to
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
begin to allow people to opt out of the
 
04:39:22.189 --> 04:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
municipal systems is in your opinion
 
04:39:27.230 --> 04:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
would this bill create um risk that
 
04:39:30.070 --> 04:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal systems water and sew systems
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
which you know
 
04:39:35.230 --> 04:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
are paying you know 30-year Bonds on on
 
04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
upgrades and they're obviously uh
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
operating and and set their rates
 
04:39:43.150 --> 04:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
probably annually that there would be a
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
de destabilizing effect if customers
 
04:39:49.990 --> 04:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:52.510 --> 04:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
systems thank you for your question yes
 
04:39:54.390 --> 04:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's correct so when a wastewater
 
04:39:57.030 --> 04:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
treatment facility is designed it's
 
04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
based on lows and loadings and how much
 
04:40:03.190 --> 04:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
is coming in and they're designed around
 
04:40:05.628 --> 04:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
that how big are your tanks
 
04:40:07.470 --> 04:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
um what processes are you going to use
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
and that's dictated by your effluent
 
04:40:11.830 --> 04:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
permit limits you know so the whole
 
04:40:13.390 --> 04:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
design of a Waste Water treatment
 
04:40:16.470 --> 04:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
facility is very complex and it's costly
 
04:40:19.628 --> 04:40:19.638 align:start position:0%
as we know um so yes that is based on
 
04:40:21.990 --> 04:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
the number of users when they're looking
 
04:40:23.470 --> 04:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
at how that's going to impact their
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
rates moving forward and you know if we
 
04:40:28.750 --> 04:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
can all start from a a clean slate right
 
04:40:29.990 --> 04:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know when you go into a community
 
04:40:31.750 --> 04:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
and if you didn't have anything you
 
04:40:33.270 --> 04:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
would be looking at the community and
 
04:40:34.868 --> 04:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
you would say well how much existing
 
04:40:36.910 --> 04:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
development do we have what do we think
 
04:40:38.670 --> 04:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to have in the next 20 years
 
04:40:40.628 --> 04:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
and you're going to design around all of
 
04:40:43.030 --> 04:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
that um so that's what communities do so
 
04:40:45.990 --> 04:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's very important um you know if we
 
04:40:47.830 --> 04:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
want affordable rates in the state of
 
04:40:50.830 --> 04:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we get that by increasing
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
the number of users and I think
 
04:40:54.910 --> 04:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a misconception that
 
04:40:57.070 --> 04:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
septic systems are so much cheaper than
 
04:40:59.708 --> 04:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
it is to be on a municipal system but if
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
you think about a septic system the
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
going rate right now for a new system is
 
04:41:06.550 --> 04:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
$25,000 and technically they last about
 
04:41:10.070 --> 04:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
20 years maybe 25 if you're lucky so if
 
04:41:12.110 --> 04:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
you spread that out over that period of
 
04:41:14.510 --> 04:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
time you're paying basically $1,000 a
 
04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
year for a septic system plus you need
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
to have it pumped every couple of years
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
and where does that need to go to a
 
04:41:23.070 --> 04:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facility septic
 
04:41:24.868 --> 04:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
systems do not exist without a
 
04:41:27.350 --> 04:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facility so all of
 
04:41:29.910 --> 04:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
those costs go into that we have to
 
04:41:31.510 --> 04:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
remember that so when you think how much
 
04:41:33.910 --> 04:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
you pay for your annual sewer bill I
 
04:41:35.670 --> 04:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
know mine's getting up there right and
 
04:41:37.350 --> 04:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
I've had the luxury of having a private
 
04:41:39.310 --> 04:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
setic system but I also had to pay to
 
04:41:42.030 --> 04:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
replace it so the costs are very very
 
04:41:44.670 --> 04:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
equal over time when you when you put
 
04:41:47.150 --> 04:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
them out and I think that the benefits
 
04:41:49.230 --> 04:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
of having public sewers and being able
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
to connect to them is very important
 
04:41:53.948 --> 04:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
because if we think about emerging
 
04:41:55.590 --> 04:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
contaminants and the all the things we
 
04:41:57.708 --> 04:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
don't know you know and what's the next
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminant and when you have a
 
04:42:00.788 --> 04:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
private septic system you think you're
 
04:42:03.230 --> 04:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
doing all the right things but then
 
04:42:05.030 --> 04:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
something comes out like that horrible
 
04:42:07.750 --> 04:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
four-letter word past and no one was
 
04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing so you know public
 
04:42:13.150 --> 04:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
sewers provide a purpose we're living
 
04:42:16.590 --> 04:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
longer lives because we have public
 
04:42:19.310 --> 04:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
sewers there's all good things come from
 
04:42:23.430 --> 04:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
public sewers so I can't I can't stress
 
04:42:25.670 --> 04:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
them enough you're
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
welcome cheerleader for public sews
 
04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair hold on one second
 
04:42:34.320 --> 04:42:35.230 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair hold on one second
sorry

04:42:35.230 --> 04:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:42:39.230 --> 04:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
okay um I I don't necessarily believe
 
04:42:41.230 --> 04:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
that the intent behind this bill is a
 
04:42:43.030 --> 04:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
bad idea I mean I'm hearing some
 
04:42:45.030 --> 04:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
objections to it but I'm also hearing
 
04:42:47.590 --> 04:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
that you know people shouldn't be forced
 
04:42:50.788 --> 04:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
however if someone opts out of water due
 
04:42:53.470 --> 04:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
to a private well situation like we have
 
04:42:57.470 --> 04:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
in marac um would there be and I asked a
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
similar question earlier would there be
 
04:43:02.310 --> 04:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
protections for that household's water
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
and I understand that homeowners are
 
04:43:05.830 --> 04:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
respons responsible for testing their
 
04:43:08.510 --> 04:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
water however if you're not aware of the
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
situation if you don't know what
 
04:43:12.270 --> 04:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
contaminants to test for then you don't
 
04:43:15.150 --> 04:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
know so if this bill passed would there
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
be some kind of a water protection for
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
the people that opt out education or
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
testing or something to make sure
 
04:43:26.110 --> 04:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
they're doing the right thing for their
 
04:43:28.750 --> 04:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
family thank you for the question so
 
04:43:30.550 --> 04:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
right now you know if they opted out
 
04:43:31.830 --> 04:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
they'd be drilling a well and working
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
with a licensed well driller who we work
 
04:43:35.470 --> 04:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
with very closely when they drill Wells
 
04:43:37.550 --> 04:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
to encourage testing and what the test
 
04:43:40.788 --> 04:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
for and if you go type be well informed
 
04:43:42.150 --> 04:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
on the internet search engine New
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you'll see all of our
 
04:43:46.110 --> 04:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
resources on how to do that there have
 
04:43:47.868 --> 04:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
been legislative initiatives the last
 
04:43:49.948 --> 04:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
couple years to say whenever you drill a
 
04:43:54.310 --> 04:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:56.708 --> 04:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
parameters that hasn't passed so far
 
04:43:58.230 --> 04:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
what has passed is real estate
 
04:44:00.430 --> 04:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
conveyance doc language and I think it
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
has to go the Senate still but the
 
04:44:04.788 --> 04:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
mandate to test every time you put a new
 
04:44:06.670 --> 04:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
well that has not made it through the
 
04:44:08.350 --> 04:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
legislature today but has been
 
04:44:11.470 --> 04:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
considered several times it should be I
 
04:44:13.350 --> 04:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
would remind members they need to be
 
04:44:15.310 --> 04:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
recognized to the by the chair before
 
04:44:17.430 --> 04:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
they speak thank
 
04:44:21.230 --> 04:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none want to thank the
 
04:44:26.430 --> 04:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
two of you for being here and answering
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
our questions about this bill now we'd
 
04:44:30.628 --> 04:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
like to get a utility perspective as
 
04:44:32.948 --> 04:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
Michael Lata from eversource would like
 
04:44:35.230 --> 04:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
to speak to us about this
 
04:44:35.240 --> 04:44:45.708 align:start position:0%
to speak to us about this
proposed

04:44:45.708 --> 04:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:47.628 --> 04:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
legislation uh thank you very much for
 
04:44:49.590 --> 04:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify Michael Lata
 
04:44:49.600 --> 04:44:50.788 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify Michael Lata
representing

04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
representing
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
eversource uh we are opposed to the bill
 
04:44:56.750 --> 04:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh I do appreciate uh the sponsor
 
04:44:59.150 --> 04:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
statement about removing electric from
 
04:45:00.430 --> 04:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
the scope of the bill that's something
 
04:45:03.070 --> 04:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
we would certainly support uh eversource
 
04:45:05.150 --> 04:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
does own Aquarian water and we do
 
04:45:07.628 --> 04:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
provide water services to customers in
 
04:45:10.750 --> 04:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
eight communities um we are a little
 
04:45:13.390 --> 04:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with uh some of the the
 
04:45:17.590 --> 04:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
sort of Il defined terms um in the bill
 
04:45:20.310 --> 04:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh which is why we we are opposed uh I
 
04:45:21.830 --> 04:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
think the Department of Environmental
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
Services certainly did a good job
 
04:45:26.110 --> 04:45:26.120 align:start position:0%
talking about uh Municipal ordinances as
 
04:45:29.550 --> 04:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
it relates to to sewer um some of the
 
04:45:31.750 --> 04:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
terms you know terminate connection
 
04:45:33.670 --> 04:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what that means is that a
 
04:45:37.030 --> 04:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
physical severing of a line is that just
 
04:45:39.070 --> 04:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
turning off the water meter so that the
 
04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
the customer no longer has Service uh
 
04:45:46.470 --> 04:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
capping of access point uh exactly what
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
does that mean is that sort of a a stub
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
off of a main that's that's sort of
 
04:45:53.788 --> 04:45:53.798 align:start position:0%
abandoned unless a customer uh wants to
 
04:45:57.510 --> 04:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
access it is it um you know a junction
 
04:45:59.470 --> 04:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
Point that's available in the future is
 
04:46:02.270 --> 04:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
it just the ability to uh to provide
 
04:46:05.310 --> 04:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
that access to the Future um and then on
 
04:46:09.670 --> 04:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
the um second page of the bill line
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
1B um uses the term not shall not coers
 
04:46:16.708 --> 04:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
fee shall not coers Property Owners to
 
04:46:21.270 --> 04:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
opt in um you know coers is is sort of
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh I would say undefined uh a high fee
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
could be seen as coercion to one a
 
04:46:30.750 --> 04:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
person uh could be seen as that's simply
 
04:46:32.910 --> 04:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
the cost to provide service to another
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
um so uh I'll stop there but uh we do
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
have some uh concerns from both an
 
04:46:41.470 --> 04:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
electric and water standpoint uh with
 
04:46:44.350 --> 04:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
the legislation and I'll do my very best
 
04:46:46.350 --> 04:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
to answer questions I'll just note I am
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
not an expert in water issues or energy
 
04:46:53.070 --> 04:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
for that matter okay thank you questions
 
04:46:56.750 --> 04:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
for Mr Lata representative Thomas thank
 
04:46:58.708 --> 04:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um could you just repeat
 
04:47:00.190 --> 04:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
the name of the water company that you
 
04:47:04.868 --> 04:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
work with Aquarion Aquarion thank you
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Lata
 
04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
so um I'm actually pursuing the same
 
04:47:15.070 --> 04:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
inquiry that I was uh asking the sponsor
 
04:47:16.990 --> 04:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking about this uh section
 
04:47:20.910 --> 04:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
four with the the penalty to a utility
 
04:47:23.670 --> 04:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering how eversource views
 
04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
that and and its application yeah uh
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a concerning part of
 
04:47:31.470 --> 04:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
the bill to us especially as I described
 
04:47:35.150 --> 04:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
sort of some of the IL defined um other
 
04:47:38.030 --> 04:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
requirements certainly we want you know
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
very clear uh statute very clear rules
 
04:47:44.110 --> 04:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
if if the potential for a fine is a
 
04:47:49.510 --> 04:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:51.868 --> 04:47:51.878 align:start position:0%
dollars thank you seeing no further
 
04:47:54.948 --> 04:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
questions we'll thank Mr Lata and next
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
call on Nate Graves of the New Hampshire
 
04:48:02.110 --> 04:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association to give us his
 
04:48:04.230 --> 04:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
perspective good afternoon welcome back
 
04:48:07.390 --> 04:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
to stn thank you thank you Mr chair uh n
 
04:48:09.548 --> 04:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
GES for the municipal Association we do
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
oppose this legislation um I will not
 
04:48:14.350 --> 04:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
repeat anything that has been said by
 
04:48:16.470 --> 04:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
any other stakeholders today except to
 
04:48:18.190 --> 04:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
say that we agree with all of the points
 
04:48:21.868 --> 04:48:21.878 align:start position:0%
already made um I want to answer first
 
04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
um representative corman's question
 
04:48:27.548 --> 04:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
about uh the rates I don't know how it
 
04:48:30.510 --> 04:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
works in for private utilities but in
 
04:48:33.150 --> 04:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
the case of municipally owned utilities
 
04:48:35.670 --> 04:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
often what you have is a village
 
04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
District which is a special basically
 
04:48:40.670 --> 04:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
special type unit of government um that
 
04:48:43.030 --> 04:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
operates for the purpose of providing
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
either electric water or sewer um and
 
04:48:48.708 --> 04:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
these Village districts
 
04:48:51.510 --> 04:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
raise taxes they pay for it through
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
taxes that the rate payers and the
 
04:48:56.628 --> 04:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are the same um so in the case
 
04:48:58.590 --> 04:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
of any of them being assess any
 
04:49:00.910 --> 04:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
penalties basically what You' be doing
 
04:49:03.510 --> 04:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
is penalizing the rate payers cuz
 
04:49:04.868 --> 04:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who would come up with
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
all the money and then they would
 
04:49:08.670 --> 04:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
basically get that money kicked back to
 
04:49:10.910 --> 04:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
them in in the form of a lower bill so
 
04:49:13.830 --> 04:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a circle um in the case of
 
04:49:19.150 --> 04:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
of those minus whatever would qualify as
 
04:49:22.230 --> 04:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
um the harm to the property owner who
 
04:49:24.548 --> 04:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
was AG grieved by their inability to opt
 
04:49:28.030 --> 04:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
out um I don't exactly know how that
 
04:49:30.150 --> 04:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
would function so I I'm not exactly sure
 
04:49:33.150 --> 04:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
how that would work um we're also
 
04:49:34.590 --> 04:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
04:49:37.948 --> 04:49:37.958 align:start position:0%
um the the changes to existing statutes
 
04:49:42.510 --> 04:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
as the chair noted um there there are
 
04:49:45.910 --> 04:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
different chapters um for water
 
04:49:48.788 --> 04:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and electric and this is all
 
04:49:51.070 --> 04:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
combining them all into one each of
 
04:49:54.030 --> 04:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
those have different parameters now I
 
04:49:56.310 --> 04:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
think a more appropriate approach would
 
04:50:00.030 --> 04:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
to any changing any one of those or all
 
04:50:03.030 --> 04:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
three would be to uh to alter the
 
04:50:06.548 --> 04:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
existing stand statutes as Dees noted um
 
04:50:10.030 --> 04:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
147 colon 8 um requires a sewer
 
04:50:13.150 --> 04:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
connection where the occupied building
 
04:50:16.510 --> 04:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
is 100 ft from the uh from the sewer
 
04:50:18.270 --> 04:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
line and there's a local option to
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
change that amount increase that amount
 
04:50:24.548 --> 04:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
past 100 ft um as Dees noted in almost
 
04:50:26.990 --> 04:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
all cases I'm not aware of any
 
04:50:30.868 --> 04:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
exceptions but I hate to say always um
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
the what the the municipality has
 
04:50:37.948 --> 04:50:37.958 align:start position:0%
adopted as a rule is if you already have
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
a well you can stay on your well if you
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
have a septic uh system that's
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
functioning you can keep that until it
 
04:50:50.430 --> 04:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
um until it stops functioning there may
 
04:50:53.788 --> 04:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
be exemptions so I don't say always but
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
that's generally the case um and one of
 
04:51:01.708 --> 04:51:01.718 align:start position:0%
the concerns um that we would obviously
 
04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
have is we have numerous areas of the
 
04:51:04.948 --> 04:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
state which have groundwater
 
04:51:07.948 --> 04:51:07.958 align:start position:0%
contamination through various sources um
 
04:51:10.110 --> 04:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
whether that's uh you know arsenic
 
04:51:11.590 --> 04:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
whether that's pasas whether that's a
 
04:51:14.070 --> 04:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
different contaminant um and one of the
 
04:51:17.390 --> 04:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
things that you do see sometimes is if
 
04:51:18.910 --> 04:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
you have a number of Wells which are
 
04:51:21.990 --> 04:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
currently clean a new line U
 
04:51:24.190 --> 04:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
particularly a water line is run down a
 
04:51:24.200 --> 04:51:26.470 align:start position:0%
particularly a water line is run down a
road

04:51:26.470 --> 04:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
road
 
04:51:29.910 --> 04:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry yeah a number of water of
 
04:51:32.030 --> 04:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
Wells that are currently uh clean
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
testing clean but near that contaminated
 
04:51:37.390 --> 04:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
at site if you have a new larger well Dr
 
04:51:40.990 --> 04:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
drilled or another um interaction with
 
04:51:43.708 --> 04:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
that groundwater you can actually see
 
04:51:46.548 --> 04:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
that contamination plume change um so
 
04:51:50.470 --> 04:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
what you often see in the case of um
 
04:51:52.270 --> 04:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
private Wells is they'll have some sort
 
04:51:54.270 --> 04:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
of additional treatment system Ro
 
04:51:56.390 --> 04:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
filters for instance at my house because
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
you never know exactly how that
 
04:52:00.430 --> 04:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
groundwater is going to change over time
 
04:52:02.110 --> 04:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
and the testing only gives you a point
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
in time um examin of
 
04:52:08.548 --> 04:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
that um I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:52:11.628 --> 04:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
the committee may have um for
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
me okay thank you Mr Grace any
 
04:52:18.990 --> 04:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I'll thank you for
 
04:52:21.548 --> 04:52:21.558 align:start position:0%
your testimony and ask the last person
 
04:52:24.628 --> 04:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
who has signed up to speak on this bill
 
04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%

04:52:29.030 --> 04:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
energy to give us his take on this
 
04:52:29.040 --> 04:52:31.110 align:start position:0%
energy to give us his take on this
proposed

04:52:31.110 --> 04:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
proposed

legislation and before he begins I want
 
04:52:36.390 --> 04:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
to alert members of the committee that
 
04:52:39.430 --> 04:52:39.440 align:start position:0%

tomorrow so as they come in we'll be
 
04:52:50.190 --> 04:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
passing them out to members of the
 
04:52:52.628 --> 04:52:52.638 align:start position:0%

04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
need them tomorrow and with that I'll
 
04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
turn it over to you Mr robers thank you
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh again for the record
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
Griffin Roberge New Hampshire Department
 
04:53:23.788 --> 04:53:23.798 align:start position:0%
of energy my comments will be uh fairly
 
04:53:26.990 --> 04:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
brief um our position on the bill is
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
opposed and it's largely been expressed
 
04:53:32.230 --> 04:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
by those who uh spoke previously um you
 
04:53:34.470 --> 04:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
know I think we would be be very welcome
 
04:53:36.350 --> 04:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
to the fact if the electric and gas
 
04:53:38.670 --> 04:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
Provisions uh in this bill were removed
 
04:53:40.230 --> 04:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
and I believe that was the intention of
 
04:53:43.788 --> 04:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor um and with that

can representative parshall has a
 
04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair o and thank you
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh for testifying uh this is a question
 
04:54:08.548 --> 04:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
that I really don't think you want to
 
04:54:11.310 --> 04:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
answer I'll understand that but I've
 
04:54:13.070 --> 04:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
been waiting for somebody to come up and
 
04:54:16.230 --> 04:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
speak about uh the potential hazards of
 
04:54:19.510 --> 04:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
when septic uh systems fail yeah the CNL
 
04:54:21.190 --> 04:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
bacteria that they release into the
 
04:54:23.310 --> 04:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
environment I have coming from the
 
04:54:24.750 --> 04:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
Finger Lakes region of New York State
 
04:54:26.628 --> 04:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
I've seen entire Lakes devastated by
 
04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
this and um I would have enjoyed asking
 
04:54:33.788 --> 04:54:33.798 align:start position:0%
this question of somebody else would
 
04:54:35.430 --> 04:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
this regulation have an impact on the
 
04:54:37.868 --> 04:54:37.878 align:start position:0%
release of Ceno bacteria into our
 
04:54:40.270 --> 04:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
environment and I don't know was a good
 
04:54:42.270 --> 04:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
answer I would
 
04:54:47.510 --> 04:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
this um I am not in I am do not work for
 
04:54:50.548 --> 04:54:50.558 align:start position:0%
Dees I would say it might be fair to
 
04:54:52.590 --> 04:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
assume that that's as far as I'm going
 
04:54:56.190 --> 04:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
to go with that thank you very much
 
04:54:58.390 --> 04:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative Miss wood would you like
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
to answer representative parshall's
 
04:55:02.400 --> 04:55:07.030 align:start position:0%
to answer representative parshall's
question

04:55:07.030 --> 04:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:09.750 --> 04:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
since you're here anyway you made the uh
 
04:55:11.868 --> 04:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
the long Trek down from Hazen drive or
 
04:55:14.270 --> 04:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
whatever so yes yes a very long
 
04:55:17.548 --> 04:55:17.558 align:start position:0%
drive so your question is as far as
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
septic systems go and their
 
04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
functionality and when they um are no
 
04:55:26.750 --> 04:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
longer functioning as intended yes they
 
04:55:29.030 --> 04:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
can if they're not you know once they've
 
04:55:31.350 --> 04:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
reached their their useful life in the
 
04:55:33.788 --> 04:55:33.798 align:start position:0%
leech field is I'm not a I'm not a a
 
04:55:35.910 --> 04:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
septic system expert except for I've had
 
04:55:39.070 --> 04:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
one I've had to build one I sit next to
 
04:55:43.750 --> 04:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
Phil who oversees them at Dees but yes
 
04:55:48.030 --> 04:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
improperly operated or um not built
 
04:55:51.150 --> 04:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
sized properly can have negative impacts
 
04:55:52.750 --> 04:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
to our water bodies I think in New
 
04:55:55.350 --> 04:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're seeing a lot of um C
 
04:55:55.360 --> 04:55:56.868 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're seeing a lot of um C
cyanobacteria

04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria
 
04:55:59.788 --> 04:55:59.798 align:start position:0%
outbreaks um you know can be devastating
 
04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
to our our water bodies and any of us
 
04:56:03.150 --> 04:56:03.160 align:start position:0%
that live in New Hampshire I think we
 
04:56:04.830 --> 04:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
all live here for the same reason it's
 
04:56:07.070 --> 04:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
because we love the outdoors and we want
 
04:56:08.910 --> 04:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
to spend our time on our lakes and
 
04:56:11.628 --> 04:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
rivers and you know we really need to
 
04:56:15.230 --> 04:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that you know as Citizens that
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
we have properly operating and
 
04:56:19.510 --> 04:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
functioning septic system so we don't
 
04:56:21.350 --> 04:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
have negative impacts to our water
 
04:56:23.548 --> 04:56:23.558 align:start position:0%
bodies does that answer your question
 
04:56:25.470 --> 04:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
thank you it does uh I I could follow up
 
04:56:27.030 --> 04:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
more but I I'll leave it at that and
 
04:56:28.270 --> 04:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming back and answering
 
04:56:32.030 --> 04:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
that question sure yes thank you
 
04:56:34.868 --> 04:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
for and answering that question and
 
04:56:37.470 --> 04:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
since there don't appear to be any more
 
04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
and no one else has signed up to speak
 
04:56:40.948 --> 04:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
on this bill I'm going to close the
 
04:56:45.390 --> 04:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 17 uh

04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1600 FN in four
 
04:57:02.190 --> 04:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:02.200 --> 04:57:32.190 align:start position:0%
 
by

04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.200 --> 05:02:46.190 align:start position:0%
 
she

05:02:46.190 --> 05:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:48.190 --> 05:02:48.200 align:start position:0%

Bill 1600
 
05:02:58.750 --> 05:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
dfn relative to participation in net
 
05:03:01.750 --> 05:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
energy metering and I'm going to call on
 
05:03:04.270 --> 05:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of this legislation
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Tom Corman to introduce
 
05:03:08.990 --> 05:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
this bill to the
 
05:03:11.310 --> 05:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
committee all yours Tom oh thank you
 
05:03:14.670 --> 05:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
chair oose I am Tom Corman I represent
 
05:03:18.150 --> 05:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
Grafton 15 which is the city of Lebanon
 
05:03:21.310 --> 05:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
ward 3 and this is actually a bill
 
05:03:23.830 --> 05:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
requested by one of my ward 3
 
05:03:26.110 --> 05:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
constituents that constituent happens to
 
05:03:28.590 --> 05:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
be the honorable Clifton Belo who is
 
05:03:30.788 --> 05:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
chair of the community power Coalition
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh before I get into
 
05:03:35.628 --> 05:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
the particulars of the bill I do want to
 
05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
say that the Coalition will be
 
05:03:41.110 --> 05:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
introducing an amendment through me that
 
05:03:43.590 --> 05:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
will make uh two changes one is to
 
05:03:46.910 --> 05:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate section two of the bill so uh
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
all things being equal I'd rather not
 
05:03:50.708 --> 05:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
even take questions on section two
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
because we expect to amend that out and
 
05:03:57.788 --> 05:03:57.798 align:start position:0%
then uh another change will be a slight
 
05:04:00.350 --> 05:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
change in the wording to section one the
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
the new wording that is inold in line
 
05:04:06.628 --> 05:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
10 through 14 of section one will be
 
05:04:09.070 --> 05:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
crafted as a separate sentence to
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
clarify it so what I'd like to focus on
 
05:04:14.990 --> 05:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
in my very brief testimony before uh Mr
 
05:04:19.628 --> 05:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
Belo speaks is what section one will do
 
05:04:21.910 --> 05:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
and section one is going to say or does
 
05:04:25.350 --> 05:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
say that if we have a municipal host
 
05:04:27.190 --> 05:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
that is used to offset the load of a
 
05:04:29.590 --> 05:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
municipal or County aggregation for
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
example the community power Coalition um
 
05:04:36.030 --> 05:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
then it will go uh not on default
 
05:04:39.868 --> 05:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
service so that the net metering would
 
05:04:42.830 --> 05:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
be going toward the aggregation so for
 
05:04:45.788 --> 05:04:45.798 align:start position:0%
example if um if we have a municipal
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
host that is who's uh production is
 
05:04:52.150 --> 05:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
going to a community power Coalition or
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregation then that
 
05:04:56.670 --> 05:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
net metering is going there and not on
 
05:04:59.190 --> 05:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
default service and the beauty of this
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
is that we're always concerned about
 
05:05:03.510 --> 05:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
cost shifting to default service service
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
and in this case there would be no cost
 
05:05:07.990 --> 05:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
shift to default service so that's the
 
05:05:11.110 --> 05:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
the big advantage of this and um with
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take questions but I
 
05:05:16.708 --> 05:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
think any questions that you're going to
 
05:05:19.230 --> 05:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
ask me are really much better answered
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
by Mr Belo but I'm willing to sit here
 
05:05:24.750 --> 05:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
and and take
 
05:05:27.750 --> 05:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you does anybody
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
want to ask a question of Representative
 
05:05:34.150 --> 05:05:34.160 align:start position:0%

um as described by representative Corman
 
05:06:24.628 --> 05:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
um the reason uh we would uh are are
 
05:06:27.390 --> 05:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
asking for this bill and and U urge your
 
05:06:30.110 --> 05:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
support is that it provides needed
 
05:06:32.948 --> 05:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
Clarity that group net metering programs
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
with Municipal host at the scale of 1 to
 
05:06:37.788 --> 05:06:37.798 align:start position:0%
5 megaw can be developed for Community
 
05:06:39.910 --> 05:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
power aggregations in alignment with
 
05:06:43.390 --> 05:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
existing statutory requirements um the
 
05:06:45.750 --> 05:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
the current definition of Municipal host
 
05:06:48.990 --> 05:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
includes language that it's um used to
 
05:06:50.910 --> 05:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
offset the electricity requirements of a
 
05:06:53.430 --> 05:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
group consisting exclusively or one or
 
05:06:56.230 --> 05:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
more customers or political subdivisions
 
05:06:57.470 --> 05:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
and then there's a definition of
 
05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions in the statute
 
05:07:01.750 --> 05:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's in the bill existing
 
05:07:05.708 --> 05:07:05.718 align:start position:0%
language L 7 through 10 um and that
 
05:07:08.670 --> 05:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
definition includes any District or
 
05:07:10.788 --> 05:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
entity created for special purpose
 
05:07:13.070 --> 05:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
administered or funded by any of the
 
05:07:15.548 --> 05:07:15.558 align:start position:0%
above named governmental units like a
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
municipality or County and uh we are a
 
05:07:23.670 --> 05:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
special purpose entity um created uh
 
05:07:26.670 --> 05:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
pursuant to a joint Powers agreement um
 
05:07:29.548 --> 05:07:29.558 align:start position:0%
that is pursuant to RSA 53a which is a
 
05:07:32.350 --> 05:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
statute that explains how uh
 
05:07:34.708 --> 05:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
subdivisions of the state and agencies
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
the state can exercise authorities and
 
05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
powers that are granted uh to them by
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature uh jointly with other
 
05:07:45.868 --> 05:07:45.878 align:start position:0%
public agencies or subdivisions of the
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
state and the that RSA 53a characterizes
 
05:07:53.590 --> 05:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
what um The Joint Powers agreement as a
 
05:07:56.708 --> 05:07:56.718 align:start position:0%
an agreement that explains how uh a
 
05:07:58.510 --> 05:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
program would be jointly administered
 
05:08:00.750 --> 05:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly what we're doing uh
 
05:08:02.788 --> 05:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear Community power
 
05:08:05.390 --> 05:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
aggregation Municipal County aggregation
 
05:08:07.510 --> 05:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
could be either operated within a
 
05:08:10.430 --> 05:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
municipality um as an Enterprise fund
 
05:08:13.110 --> 05:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
that's expressly allowed or jointly
 
05:08:15.868 --> 05:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
through Community power Coalition or in
 
05:08:18.430 --> 05:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
in other ways as well uh but the point
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
being I guess that um when we read the
 
05:08:23.110 --> 05:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
law we think that we qualify as a
 
05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
potential entity For Whom the power
 
05:08:30.110 --> 05:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
would be offset and uh but in order to
 
05:08:32.670 --> 05:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
have Clarity in this law we are
 
05:08:35.150 --> 05:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
proposing uh in order to actually use
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
this as an offset um that there be a
 
05:08:40.670 --> 05:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
requirement in in this instance for this
 
05:08:43.628 --> 05:08:43.638 align:start position:0%
application uh that the uh customer
 
05:08:45.548 --> 05:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
generator be a customer of the community
 
05:08:48.190 --> 05:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
power aggregation and receive its
 
05:08:50.590 --> 05:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
compensation from the aggregation rather
 
05:08:52.230 --> 05:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
than the utility default
 
05:08:54.990 --> 05:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
service um there is some language in
 
05:08:57.270 --> 05:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
here that gives an example of a like a
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
water utility you know to just sort of
 
05:09:03.190 --> 05:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
help think through how this uh apply but
 
05:09:05.070 --> 05:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
I'll just sort of uh for the sake of
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
brevity skip over that and point to the
 
05:09:12.590 --> 05:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
fact that RSA 6 362 A9 uh which is
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
referenced at line 13 of the bill uh
 
05:09:17.110 --> 05:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
provides that municipal or County
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
aggregations under 53e May determine the
 
05:09:22.628 --> 05:09:22.638 align:start position:0%
terms conditions and prices under which
 
05:09:24.590 --> 05:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
they agree to provide generation Supply
 
05:09:28.590 --> 05:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
to and credit as an offset to supply or
 
05:09:31.070 --> 05:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
purchase the generation output exported
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
to the distribution grid from eligible
 
05:09:35.830 --> 05:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
customer generators and goes on to say
 
05:09:37.990 --> 05:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
such output shall be accounted for as a
 
05:09:39.910 --> 05:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
reduction to the customer generators
 
05:09:42.070 --> 05:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers wholesale load
 
05:09:44.750 --> 05:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
obligation um so it's sort of the idea
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
if we get some of our power locally from
 
05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh a municipal host that that
 
05:09:53.190 --> 05:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
actually helps serve uh the load of
 
05:09:55.628 --> 05:09:55.638 align:start position:0%
members of the community power
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
aggregation um this is consistent with
 
05:10:00.910 --> 05:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
longstanding New Hampshire policy um I
 
05:10:02.788 --> 05:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
would point in particular to the fact
 
05:10:05.150 --> 05:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
that from the very original enactment of
 
05:10:08.670 --> 05:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
net metering law in 1998 it expressly
 
05:10:11.350 --> 05:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
provided that uh electricity suppliers
 
05:10:13.548 --> 05:10:13.558 align:start position:0%
May voluntarily determine the terms
 
05:10:15.150 --> 05:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
conditions and prices under which they
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
agree to provide generation Supply to
 
05:10:20.070 --> 05:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
and purchase net generation output from
 
05:10:23.150 --> 05:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
eligible customer generators and the
 
05:10:26.548 --> 05:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
enactment of net metering um included an
 
05:10:28.470 --> 05:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
update to the purpose statute of the
 
05:10:31.270 --> 05:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
overall chapter saying that uh the goals
 
05:10:34.270 --> 05:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
of the chapter which uh upon enactment
 
05:10:36.868 --> 05:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
also included uh net metering should be
 
05:10:38.750 --> 05:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
pursued in a competitive environment
 
05:10:40.510 --> 05:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the restructuring policy
 
05:10:43.350 --> 05:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
principls set forth in RSA
 
05:10:46.910 --> 05:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
374f so um this is really a way to open
 
05:10:50.190 --> 05:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
up um right now all Municipal hosts are
 
05:10:51.548 --> 05:10:51.558 align:start position:0%
going through the utility default
 
05:10:53.390 --> 05:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
service and they're getting paid the
 
05:10:56.430 --> 05:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
full default service rate um but it can
 
05:10:58.070 --> 05:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
actually be used it's not actually being
 
05:11:00.390 --> 05:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
used to actually offset the load of
 
05:11:05.110 --> 05:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
individual customers um uh necessarily
 
05:11:07.350 --> 05:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
um but this would create a framework in
 
05:11:10.150 --> 05:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
which this could occur um and do so in a
 
05:11:12.788 --> 05:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
way that does not uh increase uh
 
05:11:17.470 --> 05:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
stranded cost or or cost shifting um uh
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
so and that is simply because they would
 
05:11:21.628 --> 05:11:21.638 align:start position:0%
not be on utility default service so the
 
05:11:23.270 --> 05:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
utility wouldn't be paying them any
 
05:11:25.590 --> 05:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
compensation for their energy output and
 
05:11:27.868 --> 05:11:27.878 align:start position:0%
we would be a pain for that from our own
 
05:11:29.670 --> 05:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
customers because it's being used to
 
05:11:33.510 --> 05:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
serve offset part of their load um
 
05:11:36.510 --> 05:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
um do want to be clear that the intent
 
05:11:41.350 --> 05:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
is to uh clarify and clearly enable this
 
05:11:43.230 --> 05:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
novel option I say it's novel because it
 
05:11:47.150 --> 05:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done before um it's not
 
05:11:49.590 --> 05:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
intended to supplant amend or limit
 
05:11:52.310 --> 05:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
existing group net metering Arrangements
 
05:11:54.110 --> 05:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh that typically involve them or in all
 
05:11:56.708 --> 05:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
cases involve the municipal hosts uh
 
05:11:59.150 --> 05:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
being a customer of utility default
 
05:12:00.708 --> 05:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
service so that they get paid that
 
05:12:02.390 --> 05:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
default service rate
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
um with members um that consist of
 
05:12:08.548 --> 05:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
individual ret retail customer accounts
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
um so there on the last page of my
 
05:12:12.868 --> 05:12:12.878 align:start position:0%
written testimony in the middle italics
 
05:12:15.868 --> 05:12:15.878 align:start position:0%
there is a suggestion uh on proposed new
 
05:12:19.030 --> 05:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
language uh that could uh substitute for
 
05:12:22.350 --> 05:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
the language on on pages on uh lines 10
 
05:12:26.270 --> 05:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
through 14 of the bill um just reading
 
05:12:29.070 --> 05:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
when a municipal host consents to use
 
05:12:30.948 --> 05:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
its generation to offset the group load
 
05:12:33.510 --> 05:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
of a municipal or County aggregation and
 
05:12:35.948 --> 05:12:35.958 align:start position:0%
not individual retail customer accounts
 
05:12:37.590 --> 05:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
then it shall be a customer of a
 
05:12:39.788 --> 05:12:39.798 align:start position:0%
municipal or County aggregation and not
 
05:12:41.670 --> 05:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
on utility default service with
 
05:12:43.270 --> 05:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
compensation for their output made
 
05:12:47.910 --> 05:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 362 A9 Roman 2 so that
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's the basic notion and just a quick
 
05:12:52.150 --> 05:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
word about part two of the bill it was
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
intended to help maximize the value of
 
05:12:55.948 --> 05:12:55.958 align:start position:0%
net meter Generation by treating them as
 
05:12:58.868 --> 05:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
load reducers rather than I and wingland
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
Market participants currently about 51
 
05:13:02.548 --> 05:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
out of
 
05:13:02.558 --> 05:13:05.230 align:start position:0%
out of
some

05:13:05.230 --> 05:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:13:08.030 --> 05:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
16,000 net metered uh customer
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
generators uh do simultaneously sell
 
05:13:12.070 --> 05:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
their power into the ice New England
 
05:13:14.350 --> 05:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
Market create some jurisdictional
 
05:13:16.150 --> 05:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
questions but those issues are currently
 
05:13:18.470 --> 05:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
being considered at the Pu in their net
 
05:13:21.270 --> 05:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
metering uh proceeding looking at
 
05:13:23.990 --> 05:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
updating uh terms conditions and tariffs
 
05:13:26.868 --> 05:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
for net metering uh particularly for
 
05:13:28.548 --> 05:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
those customers on utility default
 
05:13:31.070 --> 05:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
service so it's appropriate uh to delete
 
05:13:33.590 --> 05:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
section to the bill and allow the Pu to
 
05:13:35.750 --> 05:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
consider those issues in that
 
05:13:38.110 --> 05:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
proceeding um so that's that's basically
 
05:13:40.270 --> 05:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
it and I thank you for your attention
 
05:13:43.910 --> 05:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
and interest in the bill well thank you
 
05:13:47.390 --> 05:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
so the the last statement you made about
 
05:13:50.470 --> 05:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
deleting section two of the bill
 
05:13:53.430 --> 05:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
M because there's an ongoing docket at
 
05:13:55.470 --> 05:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission about
 
05:13:57.628 --> 05:13:57.638 align:start position:0%
net metering yes when you testified
 
05:14:00.190 --> 05:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
earlier this year on House Bill
 
05:14:03.310 --> 05:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
1398 you stated that we shouldn't make
 
05:14:05.548 --> 05:14:05.558 align:start position:0%
any changes to net metering law until
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
that docket is
 
05:14:10.430 --> 05:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
completed but now you're here suggesting
 
05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
that we should change uh net metering
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
law before that docket is completed can
 
05:14:20.310 --> 05:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
you shed some light on why you believe
 
05:14:22.230 --> 05:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's okay to do it here where it wasn't
 
05:14:27.390 --> 05:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
okay to do it on HB 1398 well um House
 
05:14:27.400 --> 05:14:28.110 align:start position:0%
okay to do it on HB 1398 well um House
Bill

05:14:28.110 --> 05:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:14:32.548 --> 05:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
1398 changed how exports to the the uh
 
05:14:34.190 --> 05:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
the compensation paid to net meter
 
05:14:37.750 --> 05:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
customers by the utility uh would be
 
05:14:40.110 --> 05:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
treated as but I'd like you to comment
 
05:14:42.788 --> 05:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
on your suggestion that we need to wait
 
05:14:45.030 --> 05:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
until that docket is finished before we
 
05:14:48.150 --> 05:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
change net metering law again um well I
 
05:14:51.070 --> 05:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
don't I I guess I don't really recall
 
05:14:53.110 --> 05:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
saying we shouldn't make any changes uh
 
05:14:56.150 --> 05:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
to the net metering law this is this
 
05:14:58.030 --> 05:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
what's presented in part one of the bill
 
05:15:01.070 --> 05:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
is not uh something that's really it
 
05:15:03.030 --> 05:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's not it's not in any way pending
 
05:15:05.310 --> 05:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
before the commission currently it's not
 
05:15:07.990 --> 05:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
an issue that was in any way noticed in
 
05:15:10.830 --> 05:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
their uh order of notice and so and and
 
05:15:13.590 --> 05:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's also too late to you know besides
 
05:15:15.270 --> 05:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's beyond the scope of
 
05:15:17.750 --> 05:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
the current net metering docket so in
 
05:15:19.510 --> 05:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
that sense
 
05:15:22.868 --> 05:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
um you know to to not act on section one
 
05:15:24.830 --> 05:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill just puts puts that issue
 
05:15:28.788 --> 05:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
off and uh creates a situation where the
 
05:15:31.910 --> 05:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
only option for new Municipal host is is
 
05:15:34.470 --> 05:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
to go onto utility default service and I
 
05:15:36.270 --> 05:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
would just note that there are scores
 
05:15:39.390 --> 05:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
literally scores of potential projects
 
05:15:41.910 --> 05:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
in the interconnection queue in the 1 to
 
05:15:44.788 --> 05:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
5 megawatt range and so just as an
 
05:15:46.350 --> 05:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
example why why I think this would be
 
05:15:48.990 --> 05:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial to to act now on this the
 
05:15:51.430 --> 05:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
city of Lebanon will go online sometime
 
05:15:53.150 --> 05:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
later this year with a one megawatt
 
05:15:55.628 --> 05:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
landfill gas to energy project it it
 
05:15:58.310 --> 05:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
will produce as much power as a a 4
 
05:16:00.750 --> 05:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
megawatt PV system because of its high
 
05:16:02.670 --> 05:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
capacity Factor
 
05:16:05.628 --> 05:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
um it will produce more than enough to
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
offset the entire City's load as well as
 
05:16:10.830 --> 05:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
probably the school district's load um
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
so we could sign it up with traditional
 
05:16:14.670 --> 05:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
group net metering the way it is now it
 
05:16:16.190 --> 05:16:16.200 align:start position:0%
could also be bigger than one megawatt
 
05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of solar that we'd
 
05:16:19.628 --> 05:16:19.638 align:start position:0%
like to put behind the same meter point
 
05:16:21.788 --> 05:16:21.798 align:start position:0%
so we could qualify as a municipal host
 
05:16:23.750 --> 05:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and then get the full utility
 
05:16:26.910 --> 05:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
default service while in fact those same
 
05:16:29.510 --> 05:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
customers uh those governmental entities
 
05:16:31.548 --> 05:16:31.558 align:start position:0%
within our community are actually paying
 
05:16:32.830 --> 05:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
substantially less because they've
 
05:16:34.708 --> 05:16:34.718 align:start position:0%
switched over to Lebanon Community power
 
05:16:37.110 --> 05:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
which is which is less and then all
 
05:16:40.708 --> 05:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
those cost of paying out um at the full
 
05:16:42.750 --> 05:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
utility default service rate would end
 
05:16:45.670 --> 05:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
up being uh cost that under the current
 
05:16:48.150 --> 05:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
structure get shifted to other customers
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
potentially through a uh something like
 
05:16:53.230 --> 05:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
a strain of cost recovery charge if on
 
05:16:56.070 --> 05:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
the other hand uh we had this option and
 
05:16:59.110 --> 05:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
there was Clarity on it um uh the city
 
05:17:01.030 --> 05:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
of Lebanon you know we've all talked
 
05:17:03.030 --> 05:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
about it we would rather prefer that
 
05:17:06.190 --> 05:17:06.200 align:start position:0%
output um go to offset the load of the
 
05:17:10.070 --> 05:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
aggregation as a whole and we believe
 
05:17:11.510 --> 05:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
that we can work out a reasonable
 
05:17:13.830 --> 05:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
compensation Arrangement such that that
 
05:17:16.510 --> 05:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
makes makes sense for both the city and
 
05:17:18.390 --> 05:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
Lebanon Community power which which is
 
05:17:22.230 --> 05:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
in effect a program of the city um so
 
05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
and and in that structure uh because we
 
05:17:27.510 --> 05:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
would be looking at an arrangement that
 
05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
provided stable income for the city to
 
05:17:31.830 --> 05:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know offset its cost of putting in
 
05:17:34.150 --> 05:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
the landfill gas to energy project all
 
05:17:36.070 --> 05:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
those costs would be recovered from
 
05:17:38.548 --> 05:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
within Lebanon Community power so here's
 
05:17:41.110 --> 05:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
an option to to bring online that new
 
05:17:44.350 --> 05:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
resource and have it serve in such a way
 
05:17:47.830 --> 05:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't ask the default utility
 
05:17:50.788 --> 05:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
to cover any of the cost for that output
 
05:17:52.670 --> 05:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
and and therefore those costs are not
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
costs that they have to look at
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
recovering from all rate payers um so so
 
05:18:00.150 --> 05:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
I think there's a practical application
 
05:18:03.110 --> 05:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
of where passing this now creates a
 
05:18:05.230 --> 05:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
situation where where we can actually do
 
05:18:07.670 --> 05:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
something to avoid any additional cost
 
05:18:09.910 --> 05:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
shifting and yet enable this project to
 
05:18:12.030 --> 05:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
go forward and and and ser benefit the
 
05:18:14.190 --> 05:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
community absent this we'll go the
 
05:18:16.190 --> 05:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
traditional net metering route and just
 
05:18:18.868 --> 05:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
take take the money but this this would
 
05:18:21.230 --> 05:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
be a better arrangement I think okay
 
05:18:24.628 --> 05:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
thank you so having signed the joint
 
05:18:27.670 --> 05:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
Powers agreement for the town of eping
 
05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
I'm aware that
 
05:18:33.390 --> 05:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
currently customers or citizens and
 
05:18:35.948 --> 05:18:35.958 align:start position:0%
eping who do net metering have to stay
 
05:18:38.948 --> 05:18:38.958 align:start position:0%
on default service they can't move to
 
05:18:42.030 --> 05:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
eping community power can you explain to
 
05:18:45.030 --> 05:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
me exactly why they can't do that um
 
05:18:47.628 --> 05:18:47.638 align:start position:0%
there's two issues why that they can
 
05:18:49.390 --> 05:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
move it's just that we are we can't
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
compensate them for their output and
 
05:18:54.110 --> 05:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's two reasons for that one is
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
05:18:58.628 --> 05:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
getting regular
 
05:19:01.750 --> 05:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
or uh consistent report reporting from
 
05:19:03.548 --> 05:19:03.558 align:start position:0%
the utilities on what those exports to
 
05:19:07.190 --> 05:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
the grid are um they they report zero
 
05:19:09.070 --> 05:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
when a customer exports power to the
 
05:19:12.150 --> 05:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
grid to a competitive supplier or CPA
 
05:19:14.910 --> 05:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
what they report to us is zero so we
 
05:19:18.110 --> 05:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
don't even know what those experts to
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
the grid are so how can we even begin to
 
05:19:22.590 --> 05:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
think about compensating them that's one
 
05:19:25.390 --> 05:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
problem now to be clear two of the
 
05:19:28.628 --> 05:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
utilities uh eversource and Unitil have
 
05:19:31.670 --> 05:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
said they'll start giving us quarter
 
05:19:35.110 --> 05:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
reports after the fact that does detail
 
05:19:38.708 --> 05:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
detail what those exports are um uh
 
05:19:40.430 --> 05:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
Liberty has said they'll do that but
 
05:19:41.670 --> 05:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
they haven't gotten around to it yet
 
05:19:43.830 --> 05:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
they haven't been able to reproduce that
 
05:19:45.788 --> 05:19:45.798 align:start position:0%
report so we're still in the dark as to
 
05:19:48.590 --> 05:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
what uh and some net meters net meter
 
05:19:50.030 --> 05:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
customers did decide to come over
 
05:19:51.310 --> 05:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
anyways even though they lose their
 
05:19:53.150 --> 05:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
credit the other reason which is a
 
05:19:57.270 --> 05:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
really big reason is um is the
 
05:19:59.990 --> 05:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
language um that I point
 
05:20:02.830 --> 05:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
to um at the bottom of page two of my
 
05:20:05.470 --> 05:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
testimony in the top of Page Three it's
 
05:20:07.230 --> 05:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
really the top of Page
 
05:20:10.590 --> 05:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
Three that does say such output shall be
 
05:20:12.430 --> 05:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
accounted for as a reduction to the
 
05:20:14.190 --> 05:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
customer generator's electricity
 
05:20:15.990 --> 05:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
suppliers wholesale load
 
05:20:18.910 --> 05:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
obligation um n of applicable line loss
 
05:20:20.910 --> 05:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
adjustments as approved by the
 
05:20:23.708 --> 05:20:23.718 align:start position:0%
commission that right now none of the
 
05:20:26.190 --> 05:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
utilities all four of them including the
 
05:20:30.070 --> 05:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
co-op none of them currently have a have
 
05:20:32.270 --> 05:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
a load settlement system that allows
 
05:20:34.830 --> 05:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
them to take into account exports to the
 
05:20:38.270 --> 05:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
grid um we need that to happen we need
 
05:20:41.548 --> 05:20:41.558 align:start position:0%
to uh uh Implement that law we are
 
05:20:44.190 --> 05:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
preparing we we've been talking with the
 
05:20:46.510 --> 05:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
three investor own utilities about this
 
05:20:47.868 --> 05:20:47.878 align:start position:0%
uh we actually have another meeting with
 
05:20:49.708 --> 05:20:49.718 align:start position:0%
them tomorrow afternoon to continue our
 
05:20:52.150 --> 05:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
discussions about how to achieve this uh
 
05:20:54.708 --> 05:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
but the long and short of that is we we
 
05:20:59.150 --> 05:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
need um uh we need to have that
 
05:21:02.548 --> 05:21:02.558 align:start position:0%
implemented so such such that we're in a
 
05:21:04.230 --> 05:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
position to compensate the customer
 
05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
because we're getting some value from
 
05:21:07.990 --> 05:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
them and that value being their exports
 
05:21:10.310 --> 05:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
to the grid being counted as an offset
 
05:21:12.548 --> 05:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
to what we otherwise would have to buy
 
05:21:15.750 --> 05:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh from ISO New England um so those are
 
05:21:18.270 --> 05:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
the two parts that we need to uh sort of
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
fix or get in place in order for us to
 
05:21:22.708 --> 05:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
be able to serve net beer customers and
 
05:21:24.070 --> 05:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
and be able to give them credit for
 
05:21:26.070 --> 05:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
their experts to the
 
05:21:28.750 --> 05:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
grid thank you other questions for Mr
 
05:21:31.628 --> 05:21:31.638 align:start position:0%
Belo representative McGee has one thank
 
05:21:33.910 --> 05:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you Mr vo um I
 
05:21:36.110 --> 05:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
want to follow on to what you just said
 
05:21:39.390 --> 05:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
about those two two issues so how far
 
05:21:41.990 --> 05:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
are we or how far are the utilities from
 
05:21:45.230 --> 05:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
being able to provide that that load
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
settlement Shore
 
05:21:50.030 --> 05:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
up I where where are we at I mean that's
 
05:21:52.430 --> 05:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
I can't really say I mean the utilities
 
05:21:54.510 --> 05:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
could speak to that better than I could
 
05:21:57.150 --> 05:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
um essentially what they've said is you
 
05:22:00.310 --> 05:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
know they this this this notion was also
 
05:22:03.628 --> 05:22:03.638 align:start position:0%
reflected in the pu's rules um and in
 
05:22:06.030 --> 05:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
uh so it's both in the rules and the law
 
05:22:10.670 --> 05:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
but it's still does require the Pu to
 
05:22:12.788 --> 05:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
make a determine as to what line loss
 
05:22:16.270 --> 05:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
factor to work into that uh formula if
 
05:22:18.150 --> 05:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
you will be because there is when you're
 
05:22:20.030 --> 05:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
offsetting load on the distribution grid
 
05:22:22.350 --> 05:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
there's still some line loss because you
 
05:22:24.510 --> 05:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
from a physics point of view you will
 
05:22:26.948 --> 05:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
offset the sort of the nearest load and
 
05:22:29.430 --> 05:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
if your big system it may be the whole
 
05:22:31.110 --> 05:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
circuit or back up to the sub Sub
 
05:22:33.030 --> 05:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
Station if you're small system it maybe
 
05:22:34.350 --> 05:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
just your neighbor's load behind the
 
05:22:36.390 --> 05:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
same Transformer so there's a loss
 
05:22:38.910 --> 05:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
Factor there that is somewhat smaller
 
05:22:40.628 --> 05:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
than the loss factor to get all the way
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
up to the regional transmission grid um
 
05:22:46.190 --> 05:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
which involves losses from uh
 
05:22:49.470 --> 05:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
substations and step down from 345 KV
 
05:22:52.590 --> 05:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
down to distribution voltage so so that
 
05:22:54.110 --> 05:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
that needs to be resolved but once
 
05:22:56.910 --> 05:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
that's resolved
 
05:22:59.590 --> 05:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
um as near as we can tell the utilities
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
haven't really planned for this and and
 
05:23:03.390 --> 05:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
basically they're saying it's a big IT
 
05:23:04.948 --> 05:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
project to change their systems to
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
implement this we don't know that that's
 
05:23:08.830 --> 05:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
the case we're trying to sort of fact
 
05:23:11.390 --> 05:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
find and we we H are finding that there
 
05:23:13.868 --> 05:23:13.878 align:start position:0%
are uh load Settlement Services that
 
05:23:15.948 --> 05:23:15.958 align:start position:0%
take into account exports to the grid so
 
05:23:17.990 --> 05:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not a novel thing in terms
 
05:23:20.310 --> 05:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
of load settlement it's just apparently
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
novel in New
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and just followup followup so
 
05:23:26.670 --> 05:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds like that piece might be under
 
05:23:29.150 --> 05:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
the pu's purview to try and make those
 
05:23:30.310 --> 05:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
determinations and figure that out with
 
05:23:32.390 --> 05:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
the utilities but back to the piece that
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
you referred us to in the italicized uh
 
05:23:37.390 --> 05:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph on page four of your testimony
 
05:23:40.390 --> 05:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
yes that is what the amendment which I
 
05:23:43.230 --> 05:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
think is being handed around now uh is
 
05:23:46.230 --> 05:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
that the piece that the amendment tries
 
05:23:49.310 --> 05:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
to resolve with this bill
 
05:23:51.708 --> 05:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
today um I don't know I haven't seen
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment oh the amendment that's
 
05:23:56.350 --> 05:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
circulating is not related to this this
 
05:23:58.230 --> 05:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
a different amendment I don't have you I
 
05:24:00.510 --> 05:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the amendment on 1600 so I'm
 
05:24:03.270 --> 05:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
not in talking with representative of
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
Vos um last week um he indicated this
 
05:24:09.350 --> 05:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
bill's not for executive or work session
 
05:24:11.470 --> 05:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um so there's a little bit of
 
05:24:14.350 --> 05:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
time to get this and quite honestly this
 
05:24:16.788 --> 05:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
was a bit of a negotiation with
 
05:24:18.190 --> 05:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
particularly the grant State Hydro
 
05:24:20.948 --> 05:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
Association which is mainly represents
 
05:24:23.270 --> 05:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
about 40 of these generators who are
 
05:24:25.110 --> 05:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
simultaneously selling the iso New
 
05:24:27.270 --> 05:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
England market and participating in net
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
metering and they they they uh had a
 
05:24:32.628 --> 05:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
indicate a strong preference for this
 
05:24:35.190 --> 05:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
issue not to be addressed in this bill
 
05:24:37.830 --> 05:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh but rather you know at the Pu where
 
05:24:40.350 --> 05:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
where where the issue is being
 
05:24:42.830 --> 05:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
adjudicated as as part of other things
 
05:24:44.948 --> 05:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
representative Ms has a question thank
 
05:24:46.830 --> 05:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:24:48.750 --> 05:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
question I just want to follow up on the
 
05:24:52.510 --> 05:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
question from um our chair um this bill
 
05:24:54.910 --> 05:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything to address that
 
05:24:56.510 --> 05:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
issue with
 
05:25:00.548 --> 05:25:00.558 align:start position:0%
individual um net metered customers does
 
05:25:00.558 --> 05:25:01.750 align:start position:0%
individual um net metered customers does
it

05:25:01.750 --> 05:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:25:05.628 --> 05:25:05.638 align:start position:0%
no no um and in fact this this bill
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do anything uh
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
for the Lebanon landfill Gas Energy
 
05:25:13.470 --> 05:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
project as an example and and there's
 
05:25:15.788 --> 05:25:15.798 align:start position:0%
many others many of our communities have
 
05:25:17.590 --> 05:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
sites that they are suitable for 1 to
 
05:25:19.310 --> 05:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
five megawatt projects that they'd like
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
to see develop potentially to serve the
 
05:25:23.708 --> 05:25:23.718 align:start position:0%
community power aggregation um but that
 
05:25:25.350 --> 05:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
load settlement issue has to be
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
separately resolved um and I think
 
05:25:29.150 --> 05:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's just a matter of time through the
 
05:25:31.948 --> 05:25:31.958 align:start position:0%
Pu processes but once once that occurs
 
05:25:33.430 --> 05:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
then it would create this as a real
 
05:25:35.030 --> 05:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
possibility obviously from our point of
 
05:25:37.030 --> 05:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
view we'd like to see that resolved in a
 
05:25:39.350 --> 05:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
matter of months and not years but but
 
05:25:42.190 --> 05:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
that remains to be seen followup
 
05:25:46.830 --> 05:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
followup so so which um which entities
 
05:25:49.390 --> 05:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
this is this going to affect or
 
05:25:52.110 --> 05:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
benefit um I I think it would benefit
 
05:25:54.708 --> 05:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
rate paays in general because more
 
05:25:57.628 --> 05:25:57.638 align:start position:0%
projects under the municipal host rubric
 
05:25:59.868 --> 05:25:59.878 align:start position:0%
would not some of those projects may not
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
go on to you IL default service creating
 
05:26:07.270 --> 05:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
those those costs there um and then it
 
05:26:09.910 --> 05:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
potentially benefits any Community power
 
05:26:13.430 --> 05:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
aggregation program that has enough load
 
05:26:16.910 --> 05:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
that could be matched and offset uh by a
 
05:26:19.628 --> 05:26:19.638 align:start position:0%
local uh project it it would have to be
 
05:26:22.830 --> 05:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
a local project because in the current
 
05:26:25.110 --> 05:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
um load settlement system you need to
 
05:26:26.590 --> 05:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
settle all the load within the
 
05:26:28.470 --> 05:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
boundaries of what's called a load asset
 
05:26:31.270 --> 05:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
ID number which is the iso New England
 
05:26:34.470 --> 05:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh terminology for
 
05:26:38.750 --> 05:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh how loads get settled so you know for
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
Lebanon Community power just as an
 
05:26:45.708 --> 05:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
example um our our loads currently only
 
05:26:48.150 --> 05:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
positive loads but those get settled in
 
05:26:50.548 --> 05:26:50.558 align:start position:0%
a unique load asset ID that's unique to
 
05:26:53.190 --> 05:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon um uh Lebanon
 
05:26:55.150 --> 05:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
Community power so the generator would
 
05:26:58.270 --> 05:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
need to be part of that um to be to be
 
05:27:00.150 --> 05:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
used to offset that load so that you
 
05:27:02.670 --> 05:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
could take those exports to the grid and
 
05:27:04.230 --> 05:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
essentially subtract them out of the
 
05:27:08.590 --> 05:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
load and um and and thereby um you know
 
05:27:10.350 --> 05:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
determine your actual net
 
05:27:12.990 --> 05:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
load I I I I should mention what's
 
05:27:15.510 --> 05:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
happening to all those exports now it
 
05:27:17.310 --> 05:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
ends up in a bucket called unaccounted
 
05:27:19.470 --> 05:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
for energy lit literally it's not being
 
05:27:21.830 --> 05:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
accounted for literally the utilities
 
05:27:24.150 --> 05:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
told me or at least eversource did that
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
they could not um uh come up with a
 
05:27:31.350 --> 05:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um uh data data set for
 
05:27:33.030 --> 05:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
what the exports to the grid are by net
 
05:27:35.150 --> 05:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
metered customers even though they have
 
05:27:36.830 --> 05:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
that somewhere in their system they just
 
05:27:38.708 --> 05:27:38.718 align:start position:0%
said it was Impractical to do they can't
 
05:27:40.750 --> 05:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
extract that data and after pressing
 
05:27:42.590 --> 05:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
them they did finally extract it for the
 
05:27:45.750 --> 05:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
seven largest and for and for 10 hydros
 
05:27:48.190 --> 05:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
and for 10 PV systems that have interval
 
05:27:50.830 --> 05:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
metering uh but but we'd hope to be able
 
05:27:52.990 --> 05:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
to look at you know the data for all 51
 
05:27:55.110 --> 05:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
of these uh generators that sell into
 
05:27:56.868 --> 05:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
the iso New England Market to understand
 
05:28:00.070 --> 05:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
that particular issue but um they're
 
05:28:02.750 --> 05:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
they're systems are constrained and what
 
05:28:04.590 --> 05:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
they can extract from them
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
apparently representative Thomas has a
 
05:28:10.350 --> 05:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um both and
 
05:28:12.788 --> 05:28:12.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here as always um
 
05:28:14.750 --> 05:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
both you and the prime sponsor have said
 
05:28:17.470 --> 05:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
that you're going to remove section two
 
05:28:20.510 --> 05:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
just for clarification yes is that line
 
05:28:22.910 --> 05:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
15 through 28 and we're just correct
 
05:28:25.110 --> 05:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
we're just taking that all out correct
 
05:28:26.350 --> 05:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
05:28:29.270 --> 05:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee has a question
 
05:28:31.390 --> 05:28:31.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:28:33.190 --> 05:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
so my question is back to the bill
 
05:28:35.830 --> 05:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
because we've covered a lot of what
 
05:28:38.230 --> 05:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
isn't that we can't fix with the bill
 
05:28:39.190 --> 05:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to fix with the
 
05:28:42.310 --> 05:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
bill uh so I think some of the language
 
05:28:45.628 --> 05:28:45.638 align:start position:0%
might be a little um hard to follow for
 
05:28:47.628 --> 05:28:47.638 align:start position:0%
some folks so I I wrote this down and
 
05:28:50.270 --> 05:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering if this might be uh a
 
05:28:51.910 --> 05:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
way to look at the essence of the bill
 
05:28:53.670 --> 05:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
which is that the municipal host
 
05:28:57.070 --> 05:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
generator shall now be a customer of the
 
05:28:59.548 --> 05:28:59.558 align:start position:0%
aggregator and that then the aggregator
 
05:29:01.510 --> 05:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
would provide compensation to them for
 
05:29:03.708 --> 05:29:03.718 align:start position:0%
their power so that would be the that
 
05:29:05.990 --> 05:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
would be the scenario that the bill
 
05:29:09.190 --> 05:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
actually allows for is that correct yes
 
05:29:12.030 --> 05:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
in the case where it's U the generator
 
05:29:13.830 --> 05:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
consents to that meaning they're
 
05:29:17.150 --> 05:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
agreeable to it um uh perhaps by a
 
05:29:19.868 --> 05:29:19.878 align:start position:0%
contract if it's a third party uh or if
 
05:29:22.030 --> 05:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
it's within house like the city's
 
05:29:24.510 --> 05:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
project it would just do it because it's
 
05:29:28.030 --> 05:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
approving that um and and and when in
 
05:29:29.510 --> 05:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
that in that case where it's being used
 
05:29:31.830 --> 05:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
to offset the aggregation load as a
 
05:29:35.310 --> 05:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
whole and not individual customer counts
 
05:29:38.510 --> 05:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
so followup followup and then the
 
05:29:42.310 --> 05:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
followup would be then us placing this
 
05:29:44.350 --> 05:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
in statute the reason to be doing this
 
05:29:47.990 --> 05:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
would be to accommodate an alternative
 
05:29:50.830 --> 05:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
to default service providers so that
 
05:29:53.590 --> 05:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's clear in statute that that is
 
05:29:55.868 --> 05:29:55.878 align:start position:0%
something that can happen and that the
 
05:29:55.878 --> 05:29:57.390 align:start position:0%
something that can happen and that the
relationship

05:29:57.390 --> 05:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
05:29:59.910 --> 05:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
between producers and off-takers that's
 
05:30:01.990 --> 05:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
happening through that relationship will
 
05:30:05.430 --> 05:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
also compensate those folks um and but
 
05:30:07.430 --> 05:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't involve any cost shifting
 
05:30:09.070 --> 05:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't involve utilities and
 
05:30:13.150 --> 05:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
default service right is that correct
 
05:30:16.390 --> 05:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
correct uh representative Kaplan has a
 
05:30:18.708 --> 05:30:18.718 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:30:20.948 --> 05:30:20.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr Belo for coming in this is kind
 
05:30:22.670 --> 05:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
of a followup to representative McGee's
 
05:30:24.470 --> 05:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
question I just need some clarification
 
05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
on the benefit to the rate payers of
 
05:30:28.990 --> 05:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
this new process where Municipal hosts
 
05:30:30.430 --> 05:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
and Municipal aggregators can go through
 
05:30:32.510 --> 05:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
the net metering instead of the default
 
05:30:35.430 --> 05:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
service H can you explain how what that
 
05:30:37.708 --> 05:30:37.718 align:start position:0%
benefit is because I'm not clear on how
 
05:30:39.788 --> 05:30:39.798 align:start position:0%
the utilities are get are are accounting
 
05:30:41.150 --> 05:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
for you say it's an unaccounted for
 
05:30:42.750 --> 05:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
bucket so how do we know that they're
 
05:30:44.430 --> 05:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
not accounting for for those costs
 
05:30:46.868 --> 05:30:46.878 align:start position:0%
somehow and um well because they told us
 
05:30:49.548 --> 05:30:49.558 align:start position:0%
they don't account for it um but it ends
 
05:30:51.628 --> 05:30:51.638 align:start position:0%
up in this bucket called unaccounted for
 
05:30:55.590 --> 05:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
energy- which which does go into
 
05:30:58.230 --> 05:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
everybody's load settlement as an
 
05:31:00.750 --> 05:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment factor to reconcile the the
 
05:31:03.270 --> 05:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
difference between the meter wholesale
 
05:31:05.990 --> 05:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
meter point and the retail meter points
 
05:31:08.708 --> 05:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
I mean normally if you had no generation
 
05:31:12.150 --> 05:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
on on the distribution grid the you
 
05:31:14.510 --> 05:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
would you would be getting you would
 
05:31:17.868 --> 05:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
take your um uh retail loads and you
 
05:31:21.030 --> 05:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
would have to buy roughly 7% more um for
 
05:31:23.548 --> 05:31:23.558 align:start position:0%
line losses so you know if you had a
 
05:31:26.390 --> 05:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
th000 megawatts you need to buy
 
05:31:29.670 --> 05:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
1,070 uh uh from um the bulk power
 
05:31:31.470 --> 05:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
Market over the transmission grid to
 
05:31:35.750 --> 05:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
serve that load um so but but so so what
 
05:31:37.470 --> 05:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
happens now because they don't account
 
05:31:39.708 --> 05:31:39.718 align:start position:0%
for these exports explicitly I mean they
 
05:31:41.670 --> 05:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
do on individual customer bills they
 
05:31:44.190 --> 05:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
know the numbers uh because they show it
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
on customer bills uh but but they don't
 
05:31:48.430 --> 05:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
account for it in terms of load
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
settlement so what ends up happening is
 
05:31:51.120 --> 05:31:53.190 align:start position:0%
settlement so what ends up happening is
that

05:31:53.190 --> 05:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:56.830 --> 05:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
um they have to adjust and we did we did
 
05:31:58.390 --> 05:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
finally get you know I asked this
 
05:31:59.590 --> 05:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
question in the last net metering
 
05:32:01.470 --> 05:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
proceeding and I could you know didn't
 
05:32:04.030 --> 05:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
get any good answers but this time
 
05:32:06.230 --> 05:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
Unitil and eversource said even even
 
05:32:08.390 --> 05:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
though they sort of publish and say that
 
05:32:11.310 --> 05:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
the line losses are on the order of 7%
 
05:32:14.270 --> 05:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
um in point of fact they ended up uh the
 
05:32:16.350 --> 05:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
Delta between retail loads and wholesale
 
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
loads is only
 
05:32:21.430 --> 05:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
4.4% um in last year in 2022 I should
 
05:32:25.150 --> 05:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
say 2022 which and that's for 247 and of
 
05:32:27.190 --> 05:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
course it varies by hour but what that
 
05:32:29.350 --> 05:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
indicates and and they also what that
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
indicates is is that that unaccounted
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
for energy is a reducing the apparent
 
05:32:35.590 --> 05:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
line losses so it reduces the amount of
 
05:32:37.628 --> 05:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
power that each load serving entity has
 
05:32:41.070 --> 05:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
to buy but basically nobody knows it
 
05:32:43.990 --> 05:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
because that number is not published so
 
05:32:46.510 --> 05:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
it it's sort of a bit of a black box as
 
05:32:48.670 --> 05:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
to what happens to these exports to the
 
05:32:52.350 --> 05:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
grid uh but but but they did concede um
 
05:32:53.868 --> 05:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
at least two of the utilities in their
 
05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
response on Discovery that certain hours
 
05:32:58.190 --> 05:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
of the day like in the middle of a sunny
 
05:33:00.990 --> 05:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
day it could appear here that we're
 
05:33:03.868 --> 05:33:03.878 align:start position:0%
buying less power um to serve the load
 
05:33:05.350 --> 05:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
than the actual load so if we're to
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
serve 100 kilowatt of load we're maybe
 
05:33:10.948 --> 05:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
only buying 95 kilowatts of power and
 
05:33:13.430 --> 05:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
obviously that's not true it's just that
 
05:33:15.750 --> 05:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's not being separately accounted
 
05:33:19.110 --> 05:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
for follow up follow up if I may uh yeah
 
05:33:21.788 --> 05:33:21.798 align:start position:0%
so I mean there yeah there's a black box
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of the load and and the the uh
 
05:33:26.390 --> 05:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
the Delta between what what they say
 
05:33:28.030 --> 05:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
they're getting and when what what is
 
05:33:30.030 --> 05:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
actually happening on the line but it's
 
05:33:31.510 --> 05:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
also a black box in terms of how they
 
05:33:34.030 --> 05:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
account for their costs um we've we've
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
learned that you know it's sometimes
 
05:33:38.390 --> 05:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
recover through a stranded cost
 
05:33:40.390 --> 05:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
mechanisms some sometimes it's default
 
05:33:42.310 --> 05:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
and they're both under the net metering
 
05:33:45.470 --> 05:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
rubric so I just want some clarity on
 
05:33:47.470 --> 05:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
how this new program is actually going
 
05:33:49.990 --> 05:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
to be a benefit to the rid payers um
 
05:33:53.230 --> 05:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
well it's a potential benefit um like
 
05:33:55.708 --> 05:33:55.718 align:start position:0%
I'll just give the example of of the
 
05:33:57.948 --> 05:33:57.958 align:start position:0%
lebanon's landfill gas project it would
 
05:34:00.310 --> 05:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
be a benefit because we would be
 
05:34:02.948 --> 05:34:02.958 align:start position:0%
potentially locking in a long-term local
 
05:34:06.150 --> 05:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
power resource at at a stable price that
 
05:34:08.310 --> 05:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
will help with future volatility in our
 
05:34:12.708 --> 05:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
rates um and and and um from our point
 
05:34:14.470 --> 05:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
of view it produce a tremendous number
 
05:34:16.470 --> 05:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
of renewable class one renewable energy
 
05:34:18.190 --> 05:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
credits which we'd want to buy as a
 
05:34:21.390 --> 05:34:21.400 align:start position:0%
package so for the St City you know it
 
05:34:23.590 --> 05:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
provides a benefit because there we we
 
05:34:25.070 --> 05:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
know that this
 
05:34:28.190 --> 05:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
project that as a result of waste from
 
05:34:29.830 --> 05:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
the City and surrounding community
 
05:34:32.150 --> 05:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
communities is being cycled back to to
 
05:34:33.788 --> 05:34:33.798 align:start position:0%
benefit the local rate
 
05:34:36.510 --> 05:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
payers primarily in the form of stable
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
rates and and a attractive long-term
 
05:34:41.868 --> 05:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
price for the renewable energy credits
 
05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh it it and it may or may not have the
 
05:34:47.350 --> 05:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
result of helping lower the actual cost
 
05:34:50.070 --> 05:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
um over time I I think it tend to it it
 
05:34:52.470 --> 05:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
will um but again the general the
 
05:34:54.150 --> 05:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
general rate payers is not really at any
 
05:34:56.470 --> 05:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
risk of that um and and even the Lebanon
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
rate payers aren't at risk because if it
 
05:35:01.150 --> 05:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
turns out we make a bad decision and we
 
05:35:03.390 --> 05:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
end up with an above Market contract
 
05:35:04.788 --> 05:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
then customers are always free to leave
 
05:35:06.510 --> 05:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
to go back to the utility to FSE service
 
05:35:09.628 --> 05:35:09.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:12.230 --> 05:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
supplier representative rolds has a
 
05:35:15.070 --> 05:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:35:17.868 --> 05:35:17.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr Belo for being here um I want to
 
05:35:21.868 --> 05:35:21.878 align:start position:0%
Circle back uh to the way you described
 
05:35:25.190 --> 05:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
this um the effect of this bill a little
 
05:35:29.110 --> 05:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
bit earlier um a common a common
 
05:35:33.310 --> 05:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
criticism of net metering in general
 
05:35:36.548 --> 05:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
especially large scale net metering like
 
05:35:38.548 --> 05:35:38.558 align:start position:0%
that contemplated in The Spill the 1 to
 
05:35:43.270 --> 05:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
five megawatt customer generator is that
 
05:35:46.470 --> 05:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
forcing the default utilities or yeah
 
05:35:49.350 --> 05:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
the default utilities to purchase that
 
05:35:51.788 --> 05:35:51.798 align:start position:0%
power at the retail rate you know is a
 
05:35:54.628 --> 05:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
cost shift uh it's a it's a cost to all
 
05:35:57.590 --> 05:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
rate payers
 
05:36:00.830 --> 05:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
and you're saying that the effect of the
 
05:36:05.030 --> 05:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
desire the goal of this bill is to
 
05:36:09.230 --> 05:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
enable um a large scale Municipal
 
05:36:12.510 --> 05:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
host to stop selling that
 
05:36:16.830 --> 05:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
power to the default utility stop
 
05:36:18.590 --> 05:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
forcing the default utility to pay
 
05:36:21.670 --> 05:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
retail rate for their power and instead
 
05:36:26.270 --> 05:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
be able to sell their output to a
 
05:36:30.070 --> 05:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
municipal aggregator which very often or
 
05:36:34.070 --> 05:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps always would be uh the
 
05:36:36.270 --> 05:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
essentially the same body of red pairs
 
05:36:39.590 --> 05:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
the same citizens is that correct is are
 
05:36:41.910 --> 05:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
we addressing a criticism of of net
 
05:36:43.510 --> 05:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
metering with this
 
05:36:46.868 --> 05:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
bill um I think so I mean I mean there's
 
05:36:49.030 --> 05:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
been opposition to opening up 1 to 5
 
05:36:51.150 --> 05:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
megawatt projects precisely over that
 
05:36:53.868 --> 05:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
concern this is a limited way to open
 
05:36:56.190 --> 05:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
that up in a way that addresses that
 
05:36:57.830 --> 05:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
concern you have a
 
05:37:01.030 --> 05:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
followup followup
 
05:37:04.708 --> 05:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
is it would it be correct to um to say
 
05:37:04.718 --> 05:37:06.910 align:start position:0%
is it would it be correct to um to say
that

05:37:06.910 --> 05:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:37:09.628 --> 05:37:09.638 align:start position:0%
this making this
 
05:37:14.708 --> 05:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
change is is necessary to to make our
 
05:37:18.548 --> 05:37:18.558 align:start position:0%
the evolution of our utility
 
05:37:21.390 --> 05:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
system internally consistent in other
 
05:37:23.230 --> 05:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
words the legislature we passed a law
 
05:37:26.230 --> 05:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
years ago to um allow the creation of
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
community power so that municipal alties
 
05:37:31.708 --> 05:37:31.718 align:start position:0%
could take on that role of aggregating
 
05:37:35.430 --> 05:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:35.440 --> 05:37:37.470 align:start position:0%
 
Supply

05:37:37.470 --> 05:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
Supply
 
05:37:42.150 --> 05:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
but under the laws that exist
 
05:37:44.110 --> 05:37:44.120 align:start position:0%
now even though the it's the
 
05:37:46.750 --> 05:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
municipality that that may act to build
 
05:37:51.270 --> 05:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
a you know up to 5 megawatt system uh
 
05:37:53.910 --> 05:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
generating system on their landfill they
 
05:37:55.590 --> 05:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
can't be their own customer they have to
 
05:37:57.910 --> 05:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
sell the ACT they have to uh sell the
 
05:38:00.990 --> 05:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
output to a utility default utility to
 
05:38:03.910 --> 05:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
derive any value from it it seems that
 
05:38:06.910 --> 05:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
seems in uh contradictory to me so I
 
05:38:10.350 --> 05:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
this feels like that this would be
 
05:38:12.990 --> 05:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
making our our progression here in the
 
05:38:15.510 --> 05:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
utility realm more consistent is that
 
05:38:19.868 --> 05:38:19.878 align:start position:0%
correct I yes and just one thing to
 
05:38:25.350 --> 05:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
point out is RSA 53e that uh enables
 
05:38:26.628 --> 05:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
Community power
 
05:38:32.590 --> 05:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:36.830 --> 05:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
96 1996 when it was first enacted says
 
05:38:40.110 --> 05:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
the purpose is to provide uh customers
 
05:38:42.590 --> 05:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
of Municipal and County aggregations
 
05:38:44.590 --> 05:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
quote access to competitive markets for
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
supplies of electricity and related
 
05:38:48.910 --> 05:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
services and to encourage voluntary
 
05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
costeffective and innovative solutions
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
to local needs and and just to go back
 
05:38:55.708 --> 05:38:55.718 align:start position:0%
to my example of the Lebanon landfill
 
05:38:59.070 --> 05:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
gas that doesn't isn't just a better way
 
05:39:01.190 --> 05:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
to Expos of the methane rather than just
 
05:39:03.190 --> 05:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
flaring it because it we can produce
 
05:39:06.510 --> 05:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
some value from it it's also an
 
05:39:09.430 --> 05:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
important local resiliency resource
 
05:39:11.708 --> 05:39:11.718 align:start position:0%
because we're going to configure it so
 
05:39:14.110 --> 05:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
if the grid goes down it can have a
 
05:39:17.468 --> 05:39:17.478 align:start position:0%
transfer switch and continue to operate
 
05:39:19.788 --> 05:39:19.798 align:start position:0%
and we're putting in a level three
 
05:39:23.270 --> 05:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
charging facility at that so the city
 
05:39:25.628 --> 05:39:25.638 align:start position:0%
which owns electric vehicles could
 
05:39:27.830 --> 05:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
charge its Vehicles particularly when we
 
05:39:29.468 --> 05:39:29.478 align:start position:0%
get electric police vehicles in
 
05:39:31.390 --> 05:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
emergency response Vehicles we could
 
05:39:33.110 --> 05:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
have charged them through this landfill
 
05:39:37.110 --> 05:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
gas project um uh uh even even if we had
 
05:39:39.390 --> 05:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
an extended grid outage so that that's
 
05:39:42.788 --> 05:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
just an example of it of an Innovative
 
05:39:45.628 --> 05:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
solution to local needs that creates a
 
05:39:49.150 --> 05:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
Synergy without having to create issues
 
05:39:51.750 --> 05:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
around this increased cost
 
05:39:54.708 --> 05:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
shifting thank you so we have six other
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
people who would like to testify on this
 
05:39:58.990 --> 05:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
legislation so I'd like to move on but
 
05:40:00.670 --> 05:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
before I let you go I want to follow up
 
05:40:03.548 --> 05:40:03.558 align:start position:0%
on representative R's question earlier
 
05:40:05.110 --> 05:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you said there were
 
05:40:06.788 --> 05:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
scores of people lined up in the
 
05:40:10.430 --> 05:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
interconnection Q uh between 1 and 5
 
05:40:13.468 --> 05:40:13.478 align:start position:0%
megawatts uh for uh net
 
05:40:17.590 --> 05:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
metering Municipal host net metering uh
 
05:40:19.910 --> 05:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
programs would you say that we can
 
05:40:22.350 --> 05:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
expect an explosion of net metering as a
 
05:40:25.190 --> 05:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
result of all those scores of uh
 
05:40:27.030 --> 05:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
customers lined up in the inter
 
05:40:30.670 --> 05:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
connection queue um
 
05:40:32.190 --> 05:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know because it's going to take
 
05:40:34.468 --> 05:40:34.478 align:start position:0%
a while for them to be processed but you
 
05:40:36.190 --> 05:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
know they're in the queue but a lot of
 
05:40:37.750 --> 05:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
them still have studies that are going
 
05:40:40.150 --> 05:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's taken us four years to get the
 
05:40:42.110 --> 05:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
Lebanon landfill gas project fully
 
05:40:43.510 --> 05:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
permitted for
 
05:40:46.430 --> 05:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
interconnection um so I think a lot of
 
05:40:49.628 --> 05:40:49.638 align:start position:0%
those have are some years out but also
 
05:40:51.628 --> 05:40:51.638 align:start position:0%
there's limited opportunities and and I
 
05:40:53.310 --> 05:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
think they're trying to position
 
05:40:55.910 --> 05:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
themselves quite honestly for a
 
05:40:57.788 --> 05:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
potential change in the legislative
 
05:40:59.708 --> 05:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
environment where the legisl Fe just
 
05:41:01.670 --> 05:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
opens up 1 to 5 megawatt for anybody
 
05:41:03.548 --> 05:41:03.558 align:start position:0%
under existing terms I mean there have
 
05:41:05.190 --> 05:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
been bills that have tried to do that in
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
recent years so um I I think that's part
 
05:41:10.310 --> 05:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
of it I think there's hope that under
 
05:41:14.070 --> 05:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
the existing Municipal host uh uh uh
 
05:41:16.310 --> 05:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
construct that there was opportunities I
 
05:41:18.590 --> 05:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
think at some point those will run out
 
05:41:20.350 --> 05:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
because they will have signed up all the
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
customer accounts that are willing to
 
05:41:27.270 --> 05:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
participate in that um so I I I would
 
05:41:30.190 --> 05:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
whether this goes forward or or not I
 
05:41:32.670 --> 05:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
expect to see continued pressure and
 
05:41:35.670 --> 05:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
interest in in that sort of scale
 
05:41:38.468 --> 05:41:38.478 align:start position:0%
project just because the economics get
 
05:41:40.350 --> 05:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
better and better as you get into that
 
05:41:42.990 --> 05:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
scale um which is another reason why we
 
05:41:44.468 --> 05:41:44.478 align:start position:0%
think this could work for Community
 
05:41:44.478 --> 05:41:45.270 align:start position:0%
think this could work for Community
power

05:41:45.270 --> 05:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
power
 
05:41:48.990 --> 05:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
aggregations um is is that at that scale
 
05:41:50.990 --> 05:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's opportunities to strike a deal
 
05:41:52.708 --> 05:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
that's going to make be favorable to
 
05:41:52.718 --> 05:41:53.468 align:start position:0%
that's going to make be favorable to
both

05:41:53.468 --> 05:41:53.478 align:start position:0%
both
 
05:41:55.830 --> 05:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
parties and really a market-based deal
 
05:41:59.310 --> 05:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
at that point okay perfect thank you
 
05:42:02.070 --> 05:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
very much The Honorable Clifton below
 
05:42:03.750 --> 05:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
next I'll call on The Honorable Bill
 
05:42:07.070 --> 05:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
babber to testify on this
 
05:42:09.670 --> 05:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
bill former member of this committee and
 
05:42:11.910 --> 05:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
a good friend of ours nice to see you
 
05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
Bill welcome back nice to be back I
 
05:42:20.190 --> 05:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
think I appreciate that kind remarks
 
05:42:22.708 --> 05:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
um I just going to make some brief
 
05:42:26.030 --> 05:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
remarks and support of this bill um and
 
05:42:28.708 --> 05:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
they will be brief in a high level uh
 
05:42:30.910 --> 05:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
like many of you I serve on a number of
 
05:42:33.670 --> 05:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
community committees two frequently
 
05:42:36.468 --> 05:42:36.478 align:start position:0%
expressed uh concerns we hear is how can
 
05:42:39.070 --> 05:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
we effectively grow the local economy
 
05:42:40.830 --> 05:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
and how do we restrain the cost of
 
05:42:43.868 --> 05:42:43.878 align:start position:0%
electric power this bill helps address
 
05:42:46.590 --> 05:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
those two issues as a former member of
 
05:42:47.868 --> 05:42:47.878 align:start position:0%
this committee there were times when the
 
05:42:49.468 --> 05:42:49.478 align:start position:0%
language details of the energy
 
05:42:52.468 --> 05:42:52.478 align:start position:0%
legislation could be a bit mystifying I
 
05:42:55.190 --> 05:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
will say this uh incarnation of the
 
05:42:56.468 --> 05:42:56.478 align:start position:0%
committee seems to be doing a pretty
 
05:42:59.430 --> 05:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
good job with that asking simple High
 
05:43:01.270 --> 05:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
Lev questions worked well for me in
 
05:43:04.390 --> 05:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
helping me reach a conclusion on a bills
 
05:43:06.830 --> 05:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
fit to the state's need questions like
 
05:43:09.948 --> 05:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
these will hb600 is drafted in the
 
05:43:12.628 --> 05:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment move rates in a more
 
05:43:14.510 --> 05:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
Equitable direction for customers I
 
05:43:18.190 --> 05:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
believe it will will hb600 help address
 
05:43:20.230 --> 05:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
the fastest growing portion of utility
 
05:43:22.030 --> 05:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
bills transmission costs which are
 
05:43:24.430 --> 05:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
already the nation's highest I believe
 
05:43:28.230 --> 05:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
it will will hb600 enhance the state
 
05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
Marketplace for Renewable Power and
 
05:43:31.990 --> 05:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
local well-paying jobs and create
 
05:43:34.830 --> 05:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
additional options for customers I
 
05:43:39.510 --> 05:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
believe it will and um
 
05:43:42.230 --> 05:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
following Clifton Belo is always
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
difficult so
 
05:43:46.868 --> 05:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
I the mystery has preceded me but I
 
05:43:49.390 --> 05:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
would be if you have any easier
 
05:43:51.548 --> 05:43:51.558 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be happy to
 
05:43:54.350 --> 05:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
answer well nevertheless we appreciate
 
05:43:57.750 --> 05:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
your perspective uh as a well-respected
 
05:43:59.788 --> 05:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
member of the
 
05:44:02.190 --> 05:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
uh former legislative Community we uh

babber seeing none I'll thank you and
 
05:44:15.030 --> 05:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
move on to the next person I'd like to
 
05:44:17.468 --> 05:44:17.478 align:start position:0%
call on Doria Brown from the city of
 
05:44:20.030 --> 05:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
NASA representing the city of
 
05:44:23.948 --> 05:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
nsha good afternoon uh Miss Brown Hello

too um hi um my name is is Doria Brown I
 
05:44:32.190 --> 05:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
am currently the energy manager for the
 
05:44:33.350 --> 05:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
city of
 
05:44:36.628 --> 05:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
Nashua uh in April of 2023 the city
 
05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
launched our NASA Community power
 
05:44:40.510 --> 05:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
program through the community power
 
05:44:42.310 --> 05:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New
 
05:44:46.750 --> 05:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah sorry about that
 
05:44:52.510 --> 05:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
yeah better all right yeah yeah yes um
 
05:44:54.110 --> 05:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
through the community power Coalition of
 
05:44:56.510 --> 05:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the first seven months
 
05:44:58.468 --> 05:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
of operation Nashville Community power
 
05:45:00.910 --> 05:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
has generated 6.4 million in Total
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
Community Revenue with 3.3 million of
 
05:45:06.070 --> 05:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
that in customer savings and 3.1 million
 
05:45:09.390 --> 05:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
in community reserves the city of nsha
 
05:45:09.400 --> 05:45:10.948 align:start position:0%
in community reserves the city of nsha
supports

05:45:10.948 --> 05:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
supports
 
05:45:13.230 --> 05:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
hb600 with the inclusion of the
 
05:45:15.110 --> 05:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
amendment strike of section two and
 
05:45:17.910 --> 05:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
modification of section one as proposed
 
05:45:20.590 --> 05:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
by representative Corbin we specifically
 
05:45:22.230 --> 05:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
support this bill because it provides
 
05:45:25.150 --> 05:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
CPAs with the needed Clarity around
 
05:45:28.070 --> 05:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal host net metering at the scale
 
05:45:30.310 --> 05:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
of 1 to 5
 
05:45:33.270 --> 05:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
megaw can be developed for CPAs in a way
 
05:45:35.510 --> 05:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
that allow for greater competition
 
05:45:37.468 --> 05:45:37.478 align:start position:0%
flexibility and aligns with existing
 
05:45:40.030 --> 05:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
state law the city of NASA's interests
 
05:45:42.310 --> 05:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
in this are a little bit unique because
 
05:45:44.510 --> 05:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
we own two hydroelectric dams on the
 
05:45:47.030 --> 05:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
Nashua River Jackson Mill which is a 1
 
05:45:49.590 --> 05:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
megawatt operation and Mine Falls which
 
05:45:52.590 --> 05:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
is a 3 megawatt Operation we also have a
 
05:45:54.708 --> 05:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
landfill Gas Energy plant at the Four
 
05:45:57.990 --> 05:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hills landfill which has the potential
 
05:46:00.670 --> 05:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
with our two hydroelectric facilities to
 
05:46:05.270 --> 05:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
power about 40% of our community power
 
05:46:09.150 --> 05:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
load so these projects support the
 
05:46:11.788 --> 05:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
city's goal in achieving 100% renewable
 
05:46:15.548 --> 05:46:15.558 align:start position:0%
energy resources by 2025 through the
 
05:46:20.350 --> 05:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
potential of this project as well as
 
05:46:23.910 --> 05:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
through being able to create micro grids
 
05:46:26.548 --> 05:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
at our landfill gas to energy plant
 
05:46:28.868 --> 05:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
which we're hoping to be able to have
 
05:46:31.150 --> 05:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
something similar to what lebanon's goal
 
05:46:33.910 --> 05:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
is which is a um electric vehicle
 
05:46:36.468 --> 05:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
charging operation at that
 
05:46:38.948 --> 05:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
site including these changes to the bill
 
05:46:40.788 --> 05:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
would retain the flexibility that we
 
05:46:42.270 --> 05:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
have under current structure which
 
05:46:44.310 --> 05:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
allows our Hydro Dam to participate in
 
05:46:46.788 --> 05:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
group net metering as a municipal host
 
05:46:48.590 --> 05:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
and serve some individual Municipal
 
05:46:51.430 --> 05:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
accounts while staying on utility Energy
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
service thank you for your time and
 
05:46:55.350 --> 05:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
consideration of my testimony and I
 
05:46:57.548 --> 05:46:57.558 align:start position:0%
welcome the opportunity to answer
 
05:47:00.310 --> 05:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
questions than thank you Miss Brown good
 
05:47:02.430 --> 05:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
to hear what uh the city of Nash is up
 
05:47:04.830 --> 05:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
to representative McGee has a question
 
05:47:06.788 --> 05:47:06.798 align:start position:0%
for you thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:47:08.910 --> 05:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
you Miss Brown for taking my question
 
05:47:12.868 --> 05:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that NASA had um recovered
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
6.4 million in Revenue I believe in the
 
05:47:17.628 --> 05:47:17.638 align:start position:0%
last year can you just explain to us how
 
05:47:20.468 --> 05:47:20.478 align:start position:0%
that's come in what it's related to so
 
05:47:22.390 --> 05:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
we can understand yes where the benefits
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
are coming from so I said that we
 
05:47:28.030 --> 05:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
created 6.4 million in community value
 
05:47:30.070 --> 05:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
um Revenue would actually be higher than
 
05:47:31.510 --> 05:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
that I think last time I looked at the
 
05:47:34.150 --> 05:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
number was 11 million in Revenue so
 
05:47:37.030 --> 05:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
Community value is the 3.3 million of
 
05:47:40.430 --> 05:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
customer savings plus the 3.1 million of
 
05:47:42.190 --> 05:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
community reserves which we've been able
 
05:47:43.628 --> 05:47:43.638 align:start position:0%
to accumulate through our community
 
05:47:46.070 --> 05:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
power program which will help offset
 
05:47:48.468 --> 05:47:48.478 align:start position:0%
shifts in the energy Market as we work
 
05:47:50.910 --> 05:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
on pricing as well as in the future be
 
05:47:54.270 --> 05:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
able to go towards special projects um
 
05:47:56.590 --> 05:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
that might be
 
05:47:59.070 --> 05:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh programs like our Hydro electric
 
05:48:01.150 --> 05:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
facilities or maybe even being able to
 
05:48:03.628 --> 05:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
help invest in More Energy Efficiency
 
05:48:07.548 --> 05:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:10.030 --> 05:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
community further questions for Miss
 
05:48:13.110 --> 05:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
Brown representative muns has one thank
 
05:48:14.868 --> 05:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:48:17.310 --> 05:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
question as a followup to representative
 
05:48:20.830 --> 05:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
McGee H how would this bill change that
 
05:48:23.670 --> 05:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
number would the the would the value
 
05:48:25.510 --> 05:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
that you'd be the community the
 
05:48:28.868 --> 05:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
community value go up down sideways what
 
05:48:33.110 --> 05:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
would it do so if we were to have the
 
05:48:36.190 --> 05:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
option of working in our hydroelectric
 
05:48:38.350 --> 05:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
facilities as well as our landfill Gas
 
05:48:40.190 --> 05:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
Energy facility with our community power
 
05:48:42.590 --> 05:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
program we would be able to create a
 
05:48:45.910 --> 05:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
more stable energy price from being able
 
05:48:48.150 --> 05:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
to sell that to our community power
 
05:48:50.390 --> 05:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
program so that value would be able to
 
05:48:52.110 --> 05:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
increase and we'd be able to have more
 
05:48:54.430 --> 05:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
consistency with our pricing so we can
 
05:48:57.310 --> 05:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
put more money towards Reserve funding
 
05:48:58.750 --> 05:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can hopefully have More
 
05:49:00.670 --> 05:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs or more
 
05:49:02.628 --> 05:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
renewable energy pro programs which
 
05:49:04.590 --> 05:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
further drive down our cost creating
 
05:49:08.310 --> 05:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:12.190 --> 05:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:14.750 --> 05:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Miss
 
05:49:16.750 --> 05:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
Brown We Appreciate You trekking up here
 
05:49:20.190 --> 05:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
to conquer to talk to us today next we'd
 
05:49:23.150 --> 05:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
like to hear from Sam Evans Brown of
 
05:49:25.150 --> 05:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire to get uh
 
05:49:27.190 --> 05:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire's perspective
 
05:49:30.070 --> 05:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
on this proposed legis ation good to see
 
05:49:33.628 --> 05:49:33.638 align:start position:0%
you Sam welcome back thank you um and I
 
05:49:36.590 --> 05:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
can be fairly brief we are also coming
 
05:49:38.310 --> 05:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of the bill excuse
 
05:49:39.628 --> 05:49:39.638 align:start position:0%
me for the record Sam Evans Brown
 
05:49:41.070 --> 05:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
executive director of clean energy New
 
05:49:43.548 --> 05:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um
 
05:49:46.230 --> 05:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
we uh maybe to take just a step back I
 
05:49:50.310 --> 05:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
think there from a from a broad sense uh
 
05:49:53.230 --> 05:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
we see this as a very elegant approach
 
05:49:56.390 --> 05:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
to uh open up a new way of attracting
 
05:49:59.030 --> 05:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
private Capital to to build local
 
05:50:03.030 --> 05:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
Generation Um net metering has been for
 
05:50:04.430 --> 05:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
the the two decades that it's been in
 
05:50:06.230 --> 05:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
place one of the only mechanisms that
 
05:50:07.868 --> 05:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
are in place for rate payers to be able
 
05:50:09.070 --> 05:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
to choose where they get their
 
05:50:12.510 --> 05:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
generation from um but it has its
 
05:50:14.628 --> 05:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
failings uh in order to be able to take
 
05:50:15.948 --> 05:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
advantage of net metering you tend to
 
05:50:17.548 --> 05:50:17.558 align:start position:0%
have to be a homeowner you tend to be
 
05:50:19.350 --> 05:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
have to you tend to either have to have
 
05:50:21.310 --> 05:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
capital or have access to Capital in
 
05:50:23.150 --> 05:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
order to make investments in your own
 
05:50:26.788 --> 05:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
Generation Um and this bill would solve
 
05:50:28.830 --> 05:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
those types of problems and allow the
 
05:50:32.070 --> 05:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
benefits the the cost saving reduction
 
05:50:34.230 --> 05:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
the the bill savings to be spread more
 
05:50:36.868 --> 05:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
broadly amongst all of the members of a
 
05:50:39.030 --> 05:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
community power aggregation so we have
 
05:50:40.708 --> 05:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
been working actively with the community
 
05:50:42.150 --> 05:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
power coalition to just make sure the
 
05:50:43.788 --> 05:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
language is crystal clear that this
 
05:50:46.430 --> 05:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't step on or impinge at all in the
 
05:50:49.430 --> 05:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
existing Municipal host uh program uh
 
05:50:51.310 --> 05:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
there are municipal hosts that are up
 
05:50:52.548 --> 05:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
and running right now and we just want
 
05:50:54.030 --> 05:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's it's very clear that
 
05:50:56.350 --> 05:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
you don't have to choose to use your
 
05:50:58.708 --> 05:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
generation to offset the load of a CPA
 
05:51:01.390 --> 05:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're a municipal host um
 
05:51:03.190 --> 05:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
and and have had very fruitful
 
05:51:06.270 --> 05:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
conversations with uh with the the folks
 
05:51:07.948 --> 05:51:07.958 align:start position:0%
that have been involved in those and so
 
05:51:10.788 --> 05:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
I think we will have um a really strong
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill that comes out of this that that
 
05:51:14.590 --> 05:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
enables more folks to to access the the
 
05:51:16.350 --> 05:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
cost savings that that net metering can
 
05:51:18.110 --> 05:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
provide so would that would have you to
 
05:51:21.670 --> 05:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
take questions or just recede into the
 
05:51:24.110 --> 05:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
background you can never recede into the
 
05:51:25.788 --> 05:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
background I
 
05:51:30.070 --> 05:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
try questions for Mr everence Brown
 
05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none I guess you're going to have
 
05:51:33.750 --> 05:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
to recede but I'm sure it won't be to
 
05:51:38.310 --> 05:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
the background okay next up is Matt
 
05:51:42.390 --> 05:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
Milow or mle or Miller I can't quite
 
05:51:45.150 --> 05:51:45.160 align:start position:0%

volunteer for pimbrook on the uh energy
 
05:52:13.190 --> 05:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
committee and in on their budget
 
05:52:18.628 --> 05:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
committee and um I'm here to support uh
 
05:52:22.750 --> 05:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
hb600 um last year March 2023 the town
 
05:52:24.548 --> 05:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
of penber voted to approve an energy
 
05:52:26.670 --> 05:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
aggregation plan enabling it to launch a
 
05:52:29.070 --> 05:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
community power aggregation
 
05:52:31.468 --> 05:52:31.478 align:start position:0%
and um the the town strongly supported
 
05:52:34.190 --> 05:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
that it was virtually a unanimous um
 
05:52:36.868 --> 05:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
vote in the during the last year's town
 
05:52:40.708 --> 05:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
meeting um and our CPA will launch this
 
05:52:45.150 --> 05:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
March um and uh the town's power
 
05:52:46.750 --> 05:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
Community uh Community power aggregation
 
05:52:48.628 --> 05:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
will benefit by having the ability to
 
05:52:51.230 --> 05:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
access local energy sources of this
 
05:52:52.910 --> 05:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
scale that we're talking about 1 to 5
 
05:52:55.070 --> 05:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
megawatts through competitive markets
 
05:52:57.430 --> 05:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
while avoiding this uh potential cost
 
05:52:59.510 --> 05:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
shift um through the activities that
 
05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
have already been described by previous
 
05:53:04.990 --> 05:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
speakers um I had some comments about
 
05:53:07.910 --> 05:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
the benefits of the second section which
 
05:53:10.150 --> 05:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh mainly pointed towards load reduction
 
05:53:12.190 --> 05:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
but since that sounds like it's being
 
05:53:14.310 --> 05:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
written out that's that's fine if it's
 
05:53:16.750 --> 05:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
addressed somewhere else uh that's the
 
05:53:18.510 --> 05:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
only statement I wanted to make uh that
 
05:53:20.510 --> 05:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
I support uh
 
05:53:22.750 --> 05:53:22.760 align:start position:0%

05:54:00.310 --> 05:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
with the bill as introduced but we um
 
05:54:03.150 --> 05:54:03.160 align:start position:0%

Prime sponsor to um uh just clarify
 
05:54:14.628 --> 05:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
section one um as you've heard just to
 
05:54:17.310 --> 05:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that any existing um
 
05:54:19.868 --> 05:54:19.878 align:start position:0%

that those existing Arrangements won't
 
05:54:29.270 --> 05:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
be uh impacted and um also um removing
 
05:54:31.270 --> 05:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
section two because we know that the Pu
 
05:54:33.990 --> 05:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
docket is is underway so um I can be
 
05:54:35.628 --> 05:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
very brief happy to answer any questions

but that's that's where we're at thank
 
05:54:40.670 --> 05:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
you questions for Miss scroll seeing
 
05:54:45.548 --> 05:54:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:49.990 --> 05:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
next Barbara Southland I believe I hope
 
05:54:51.628 --> 05:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
I got that
 
05:54:54.868 --> 05:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
right from close
 
05:54:58.548 --> 05:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
Bradford Barbara soued from Bradford
 
05:55:02.910 --> 05:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
it's soued m okay sorry sorry I couldn't
 
05:55:05.390 --> 05:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
quite make it out no problem a lot of
 
05:55:08.070 --> 05:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
people have problems with it usually
 
05:55:10.070 --> 05:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's South
 
05:55:13.628 --> 05:55:13.638 align:start position:0%
word but anyway I just am REM
 
05:55:17.548 --> 05:55:17.558 align:start position:0%
representing really myself but lots of
 
05:55:20.868 --> 05:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
other homeowners who have invested in
 
05:55:23.830 --> 05:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
solar I've we've got solar on our
 
05:55:26.750 --> 05:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
rooftop and then across from our house
 
05:55:29.990 --> 05:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
in the field a big array and we have
 
05:55:32.910 --> 05:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
really enjoyed getting net metering we
 
05:55:35.590 --> 05:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
get you know low we pay the minimum
 
05:55:37.670 --> 05:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
every month and then even in the winter
 
05:55:40.788 --> 05:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
time we get some credit so I think it's
 
05:55:45.070 --> 05:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
great and uh uh but uh Bradford is
 
05:55:47.190 --> 05:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
considering Community power we're voting
 
05:55:50.110 --> 05:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
on that in March and I think it's
 
05:55:53.670 --> 05:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful uh but um I'm told that we
 
05:55:56.910 --> 05:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
can't do net metering we'll have to opt
 
05:56:00.868 --> 05:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
out so I'm hoping that this bill will
 
05:56:03.230 --> 05:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
correct that situation because I think
 
05:56:04.430 --> 05:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
it's very
 
05:56:07.510 --> 05:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
ironic that um Community Powers you know
 
05:56:10.190 --> 05:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
the mission is to go towards clean
 
05:56:15.350 --> 05:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and uh but we we can't
 
05:56:18.110 --> 05:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
even participate as long as we have net
 
05:56:22.708 --> 05:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
metering so uh I'm just please support
 
05:56:26.190 --> 05:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
please vote for this bill and because I
 
05:56:29.310 --> 05:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
think it would fix that problem
 
05:56:34.190 --> 05:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:37.830 --> 05:56:37.840 align:start position:0%

05:57:15.190 --> 05:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
comments will be relatively brief we
 
05:57:17.150 --> 05:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
understand that there have been um a
 
05:57:18.868 --> 05:57:18.878 align:start position:0%
number of amendments suggested to the
 
05:57:22.708 --> 05:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
bill um we are neutral um on the bill as
 
05:57:25.150 --> 05:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
introduced we understand as I mentioned
 
05:57:26.830 --> 05:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
I understand that um there's been
 
05:57:29.110 --> 05:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
amendments to strike section two into
 
05:57:33.190 --> 05:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
modify the language in section one um we
 
05:57:34.868 --> 05:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
are just learning about that Amendment

try and formulate one this one is for
 
05:57:58.910 --> 05:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
Miss Nixon um as a person who's working
 
05:58:01.948 --> 05:58:01.958 align:start position:0%
in the electric electricity uh sector
 
05:58:04.510 --> 05:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
for the state I'm just wondering about
 
05:58:06.070 --> 05:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
the language that we discussed which is
 
05:58:07.868 --> 05:58:07.878 align:start position:0%
going to remain in the bill which
 
05:58:09.468 --> 05:58:09.478 align:start position:0%
obviously you haven't seen the amendment
 
05:58:12.150 --> 05:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
yet but around the idea of Municipal
 
05:58:16.310 --> 05:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
host generators being able to uh provide
 
05:58:18.430 --> 05:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
their energy to community
 
05:58:20.948 --> 05:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
aggregators and then being compensated
 
05:58:24.350 --> 05:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
directly from from those entities rather
 
05:58:26.948 --> 05:58:26.958 align:start position:0%
than default service do you have any
 
05:58:28.510 --> 05:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts around that particular change
 
05:58:31.270 --> 05:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
in the law as it would affect being
 
05:58:31.280 --> 05:58:32.830 align:start position:0%
in the law as it would affect being
AnMed

05:58:32.830 --> 05:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
AnMed
 
05:58:36.430 --> 05:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
customer um as Mr Rober said we just
 
05:58:38.350 --> 05:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
learned of the change today and it was
 
05:58:40.350 --> 05:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
unclear to us specifically how this
 
05:58:43.150 --> 05:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
language was was meant to be so I guess
 
05:58:45.468 --> 05:58:45.478 align:start position:0%
I'd Reserve um I'd like us to go back
 
05:58:48.868 --> 05:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:54.310 --> 05:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:57.150 --> 05:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I guess you guys
 
05:58:57.160 --> 05:58:58.310 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I guess you guys
are

05:58:58.310 --> 05:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:59:01.150 --> 05:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
off the hook thank you and done so we'll
 
05:59:03.230 --> 05:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
give the last word to M
 
05:59:15.910 --> 05:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:18.030 --> 05:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
h hello
 
05:59:20.750 --> 05:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
please be as brief as you can be thank
 
05:59:23.910 --> 05:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
you m friedricks um from representing
 
05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
both the town of Durham today and 350 NH
 
05:59:29.830 --> 05:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak um
 
05:59:32.628 --> 05:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
from the uh the town side of things um
 
05:59:35.708 --> 05:59:35.718 align:start position:0%
as a a town counselor um in Durham we
 
05:59:38.030 --> 05:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
have heard a lot of requests um over the
 
05:59:40.670 --> 05:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
past year or inquiries from residents um
 
05:59:43.070 --> 05:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
asking about how they might be able to
 
05:59:45.110 --> 05:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
benefit from something like a community
 
05:59:47.350 --> 05:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
solar project um because they have
 
05:59:49.270 --> 05:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
limitations on their own properties they
 
05:59:52.910 --> 05:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
live in the shade um they uh have an old
 
05:59:55.548 --> 05:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
roof they are renters um and so they're
 
05:59:58.670 --> 05:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
very interested in being able to um to
 
06:00:01.628 --> 06:00:01.638 align:start position:0%
have some of the um economic and and
 
06:00:04.190 --> 06:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
health benefits of doing solar um but
 
06:00:05.628 --> 06:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
they're not there's not currently a way
 
06:00:09.628 --> 06:00:09.638 align:start position:0%
for them to do that um and uh our
 
06:00:11.708 --> 06:00:11.718 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this bill would um
 
06:00:14.628 --> 06:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
clarify and enable um the ability of
 
06:00:17.510 --> 06:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
community solar um to occur through
 
06:00:18.830 --> 06:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
something like the community power
 
06:00:21.150 --> 06:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New Hampshire um Our Town
 
06:00:24.350 --> 06:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
Administrator has stated that um you
 
06:00:26.230 --> 06:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
know he would be uh certainly
 
06:00:28.150 --> 06:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable with uh a Community solar
 
06:00:30.510 --> 06:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
array um being supported through the
 
06:00:31.868 --> 06:00:31.878 align:start position:0%
community power Coalition of New
 
06:00:34.030 --> 06:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but is rather reluctant to
 
06:00:36.750 --> 06:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
take that on otherwise um in terms of
 
06:00:39.590 --> 06:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
the sighting and the the administrative
 
06:00:41.628 --> 06:00:41.638 align:start position:0%
um duties of of running a community
 
06:00:43.670 --> 06:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
solar field so this is something that
 
06:00:45.110 --> 06:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
would really clearly benefit our
 
06:00:48.230 --> 06:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
residents um and would be an enabling um
 
06:00:50.190 --> 06:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation by clarifying that
 
06:00:52.590 --> 06:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
language um and through my work on the
 
06:00:55.070 --> 06:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
town I'm also aware of community solar
 
06:00:57.750 --> 06:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
projects that are happening um in are
 
06:00:59.628 --> 06:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
sort of the design stage or the concept
 
06:01:01.350 --> 06:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
stage and at least another dozen other
 
06:01:03.350 --> 06:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
communities across the state so I think
 
06:01:05.750 --> 06:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's very clear interest in in trying
 
06:01:07.468 --> 06:01:07.478 align:start position:0%
to make this an option that is available
 
06:01:10.390 --> 06:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
to Residents um that has direct benefits
 
06:01:13.628 --> 06:01:13.638 align:start position:0%
um to Residents uh if it is enabled and
 
06:01:16.310 --> 06:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
um you know in from the standpoint of
 
06:01:18.990 --> 06:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
350 NH um we actually have several
 
06:01:20.670 --> 06:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
chapters across the state that are
 
06:01:23.150 --> 06:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
working on community solar projects as
 
06:01:25.310 --> 06:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
well so in many different areas we're
 
06:01:27.110 --> 06:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
hearing of community interest in doing
 
06:01:30.670 --> 06:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
this um and uh our understanding is that
 
06:01:32.628 --> 06:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
this bill just clarifies um some
 
06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
enabling language to make sure that
 
06:01:36.708 --> 06:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
communities have that wish to pursue
 
06:01:40.430 --> 06:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
this do have an option for it thank you
 
06:01:44.510 --> 06:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:46.590 --> 06:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
Friedrich seeing none I want to thank
 
06:01:48.670 --> 06:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
you for trekking down here today to give
 
06:01:51.548 --> 06:01:51.558 align:start position:0%
us your perspective on this legislation
 
06:01:52.948 --> 06:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
now with that we're going to close the
 
06:01:57.990 --> 06:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 1600 FN
 
06:02:01.468 --> 06:02:01.478 align:start position:0%
and in about five minutes representative
 
06:02:03.350 --> 06:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas will open a public
 
06:02:08.830 --> 06:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 16 44 FN we'll see
 
06:02:26.350 --> 06:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:26.360 --> 06:09:38.110 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

06:09:38.110 --> 06:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:41.190 --> 06:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
okay I see it's the time to get started
 
06:09:44.708 --> 06:09:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to um ask uh representative
 
06:09:50.190 --> 06:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
o to introduce uh HB 1644 FN which is
 
06:09:52.510 --> 06:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
requiring the department of energy to
 
06:09:54.670 --> 06:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
initiate an investigation of the
 
06:09:56.670 --> 06:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
benefits and key considerations G
 
06:09:58.350 --> 06:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
regarding support for clean or
 
06:10:01.150 --> 06:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
non-carbon emitting emitting power
 
06:10:04.468 --> 06:10:04.478 align:start position:0%
generation so with that representative o
 
06:10:05.510 --> 06:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
the floor is
 
06:10:08.670 --> 06:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
yours thank you Mr
 
06:10:11.628 --> 06:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
chair for the record Michael Vose
 
06:10:15.430 --> 06:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham District 5 I've
 
06:10:17.510 --> 06:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
introduced House Bill
 
06:10:17.520 --> 06:10:19.110 align:start position:0%
introduced House Bill
1644

06:10:19.110 --> 06:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
1644
 
06:10:23.190 --> 06:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
FN as a way to
 
06:10:29.110 --> 06:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:31.628 --> 06:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
electric generation that's
 
06:10:33.708 --> 06:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
reliable for the last couple of years
 
06:10:36.190 --> 06:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
I've been reading a lot of reports from
 
06:10:39.670 --> 06:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
nerk from furk from ISO New England and
 
06:10:42.350 --> 06:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
from other jurisdictional entities
 
06:10:47.590 --> 06:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
around the country discussing the
 
06:10:51.030 --> 06:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
increasing perception that our grid
 
06:10:54.830 --> 06:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
unreliable there's also a that's been
 
06:10:59.990 --> 06:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
written about our local grid here in ISO
 
06:11:03.270 --> 06:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
New England becoming less
 
06:11:06.390 --> 06:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
reliable reliability is an extremely
 
06:11:09.948 --> 06:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
important subject to the constituents
 
06:11:13.548 --> 06:11:13.558 align:start position:0%
that I represent in my district when I
 
06:11:16.230 --> 06:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
talk to people in my district about
 
06:11:18.708 --> 06:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
electricity they sometimes complain
 
06:11:22.110 --> 06:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
about the cost but the single biggest
 
06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
thing they complain about is their
 
06:11:29.110 --> 06:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
electricity being
 
06:11:31.390 --> 06:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
interrupted they complain about the fact
 
06:11:33.670 --> 06:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
that it gets interrupted and they
 
06:11:35.350 --> 06:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
complain about the fact that when it is
 
06:11:37.868 --> 06:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
interrupted sometimes those disruptions
 
06:11:42.270 --> 06:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
last for hours and in some rare cases
 
06:11:46.788 --> 06:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
days and people get extremely upset when
 
06:11:47.948 --> 06:11:47.958 align:start position:0%
they have no
 
06:11:54.310 --> 06:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:57.750 --> 06:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
concern and as reports from nerk have
 
06:12:00.830 --> 06:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
reported out extensively over the last
 
06:12:00.840 --> 06:12:02.390 align:start position:0%
reported out extensively over the last
two

06:12:02.390 --> 06:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:12:05.468 --> 06:12:05.478 align:start position:0%
years as we
 
06:12:08.510 --> 06:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
increase the number of renewable
 
06:12:12.030 --> 06:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:16.110 --> 06:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
grid we also increase the
 
06:12:19.830 --> 06:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
instability and the unreliability of the
 
06:12:23.230 --> 06:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
grid compounding that problem is the
 
06:12:26.390 --> 06:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
premature retirement of existing power
 
06:12:28.070 --> 06:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
power generation
 
06:12:30.390 --> 06:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
sources it affects coal more than
 
06:12:34.990 --> 06:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
anything else but it can affect nuclear
 
06:12:38.468 --> 06:12:38.478 align:start position:0%
it can affect even natural
 
06:12:42.830 --> 06:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
gas so Rel reliability is an extremely
 
06:12:45.910 --> 06:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
important issue that we need to
 
06:12:50.548 --> 06:12:50.558 align:start position:0%
confront as legislators and as
 
06:12:54.590 --> 06:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:58.230 --> 06:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
States the Genesis for this bill House
 
06:12:58.240 --> 06:13:00.788 align:start position:0%
States the Genesis for this bill House
Bill

06:13:00.788 --> 06:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:00.798 --> 06:13:02.310 align:start position:0%
 
1644

06:13:02.310 --> 06:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
1644
 
06:13:05.990 --> 06:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
FN was an attempt by myself to modify
 
06:13:08.468 --> 06:13:08.478 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard to
 
06:13:11.628 --> 06:13:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:16.390 --> 06:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
energy OS actually created for me a bill
 
06:13:18.390 --> 06:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
that changed our renewable portfolio
 
06:13:21.868 --> 06:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
standard into a clean energy standard or
 
06:13:25.070 --> 06:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
a zero emissions energy
 
06:13:26.868 --> 06:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
standard and
 
06:13:29.910 --> 06:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
it was actually a fairly clean
 
06:13:34.830 --> 06:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
bill and it added nuclear energy to that
 
06:13:34.840 --> 06:13:36.350 align:start position:0%
bill and it added nuclear energy to that
to

06:13:36.350 --> 06:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:13:40.430 --> 06:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
the sources of electricity generation
 
06:13:43.548 --> 06:13:43.558 align:start position:0%
that could be compensated via the
 
06:13:47.708 --> 06:13:47.718 align:start position:0%
RPS and I added nuclear in a tiny tiny
 
06:13:47.718 --> 06:13:49.510 align:start position:0%
RPS and I added nuclear in a tiny tiny
amount

06:13:49.510 --> 06:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
amount
 
06:13:53.468 --> 06:13:53.478 align:start position:0%
0.1% of the megawatt hours of a Nuclear
 
06:13:53.478 --> 06:13:54.868 align:start position:0%
0.1% of the megawatt hours of a Nuclear
Generating

06:13:54.868 --> 06:13:54.878 align:start position:0%
Generating
 
06:13:57.190 --> 06:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
plant could be
 
06:14:01.390 --> 06:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
compensated as a class one RPS uh and
 
06:14:06.270 --> 06:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
cell class one RPS zero emission Rex
 
06:14:09.670 --> 06:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
Zex as they were
 
06:14:13.190 --> 06:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
called and so I comp computed the did
 
06:14:15.590 --> 06:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
the math to compute how much this would
 
06:14:19.030 --> 06:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
cost for cab Brook alone it would cost
 
06:14:21.390 --> 06:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
about $3 million a
 
06:14:24.468 --> 06:14:24.478 align:start position:0%
year and the amount of money that se
 
06:14:26.990 --> 06:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
Brook would get out of that roughly $3
 
06:14:29.708 --> 06:14:29.718 align:start position:0%
million a year wouldn't make much
 
06:14:33.750 --> 06:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
difference to their bottom
 
06:14:37.030 --> 06:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
line but the worst part about that
 
06:14:41.150 --> 06:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
situation was that the RPS is not a
 
06:14:41.160 --> 06:14:42.468 align:start position:0%
situation was that the RPS is not a
state-only

06:14:42.468 --> 06:14:42.478 align:start position:0%
state-only
 
06:14:44.990 --> 06:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
program it's a regional program and in
 
06:14:46.708 --> 06:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
fact it's a national
 
06:14:49.430 --> 06:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
program so if you let
 
06:14:49.440 --> 06:14:51.150 align:start position:0%
program so if you let
sebr

06:14:51.150 --> 06:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
sebr
 
06:14:55.830 --> 06:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
collect monies by selling Zex you also
 
06:14:57.350 --> 06:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
have to let Millstone down in
 
06:15:00.270 --> 06:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
Connecticut sell those Zs you also have
 
06:15:03.830 --> 06:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
to let nuclear power plants from any RPS
 
06:15:07.150 --> 06:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
state in the country sell those rcks so
 
06:15:10.070 --> 06:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of this program could Skyrocket
 
06:15:12.670 --> 06:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
quickly from the $3 million that I
 
06:15:16.708 --> 06:15:16.718 align:start position:0%
originally calculated to tens maybe even
 
06:15:19.150 --> 06:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars well
 
06:15:21.468 --> 06:15:21.478 align:start position:0%
there's no way I could ask New Hampshire
 
06:15:23.310 --> 06:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
rate payers to pay hundreds of millions
 
06:15:27.788 --> 06:15:27.798 align:start position:0%
of dollars to uh support nuclear
 
06:15:30.310 --> 06:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
energy even though it would benefit us
 
06:15:35.430 --> 06:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
all so I had to abandon that idea and as
 
06:15:37.110 --> 06:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
all of you have submitted bills this
 
06:15:41.910 --> 06:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
year knows OS was backed up badly this
 
06:15:45.628 --> 06:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
fall so I didn't get my zeec bill my
 
06:15:45.638 --> 06:15:46.628 align:start position:0%
fall so I didn't get my zeec bill my
zero

06:15:46.628 --> 06:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
zero
 
06:15:46.638 --> 06:15:48.510 align:start position:0%
zero
emissions

06:15:48.510 --> 06:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
06:15:52.310 --> 06:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh standard Bill until like two days
 
06:15:55.708 --> 06:15:55.718 align:start position:0%
before the OS deadline which was
 
06:15:55.718 --> 06:15:57.230 align:start position:0%
before the OS deadline which was
November

06:15:57.230 --> 06:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
November
 
06:15:59.830 --> 06:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
17th as I recall somewhere in
 
06:16:02.468 --> 06:16:02.478 align:start position:0%
there so once I realized that I had to
 
06:16:05.948 --> 06:16:05.958 align:start position:0%
abandon that approach I had two days to
 
06:16:08.030 --> 06:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
come up with an alternative
 
06:16:12.310 --> 06:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
approach and House Bill 1644 FN is the
 
06:16:17.310 --> 06:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:21.750 --> 06:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
with what I turned the bill into was a
 
06:16:24.190 --> 06:16:24.200 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
06:16:28.350 --> 06:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:28.360 --> 06:16:32.310 align:start position:0%
 
to

06:16:32.310 --> 06:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:35.230 --> 06:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
support nuclear energy and other
 
06:16:38.150 --> 06:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
noncarbon emitting energy
 
06:16:40.628 --> 06:16:40.638 align:start position:0%
sources and I used as a template for
 
06:16:43.390 --> 06:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
that bill a bill that we had had earlier
 
06:16:48.590 --> 06:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
in committee last year to study micro
 
06:16:51.468 --> 06:16:51.478 align:start position:0%
grids and so much of the structure of
 
06:16:54.990 --> 06:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and uh some of
 
06:16:55.000 --> 06:16:58.190 align:start position:0%
this bill and uh some of
the

06:16:58.190 --> 06:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:00.510 --> 06:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
individual recommendations and
 
06:17:04.830 --> 06:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
examination areas are variations on what
 
06:17:06.590 --> 06:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
was in that micr Grid
 
06:17:09.948 --> 06:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
bill and it has become apparent since I
 
06:17:11.548 --> 06:17:11.558 align:start position:0%
filed that bill
 
06:17:14.270 --> 06:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
originally that some of these probably
 
06:17:17.430 --> 06:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
are too broad for the study that I want
 
06:17:20.230 --> 06:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
this the invest the department to do for
 
06:17:20.240 --> 06:17:21.270 align:start position:0%
this the invest the department to do for
this

06:17:21.270 --> 06:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:17:24.310 --> 06:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
investigation so I probably would like
 
06:17:26.510 --> 06:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
to work with the committee to
 
06:17:28.670 --> 06:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
make some changes to
 
06:17:33.230 --> 06:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
this language to come up with a narrower
 
06:17:36.430 --> 06:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
Focus for the Department's
 
06:17:38.310 --> 06:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
investigation now you may have seen in
 
06:17:40.190 --> 06:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
your email that the the department is
 
06:17:42.070 --> 06:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
going to oppose this
 
06:17:45.590 --> 06:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh later this afternoon and they're
 
06:17:47.350 --> 06:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
going to oppose it because it is too
 
06:17:51.868 --> 06:17:51.878 align:start position:0%
broad and they don't think that they can
 
06:17:54.430 --> 06:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
do justice to an investigation that is
 
06:17:56.990 --> 06:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
this Broad
 
06:18:00.230 --> 06:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
so I think that there is still a way
 
06:18:02.510 --> 06:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
forward if we can narrow the focus of
 
06:18:04.390 --> 06:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
this investigation to something that the
 
06:18:06.230 --> 06:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
dep Department would become feel
 
06:18:06.240 --> 06:18:07.868 align:start position:0%
dep Department would become feel
comfortable

06:18:07.868 --> 06:18:07.878 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
06:18:11.270 --> 06:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
doing and we can still make an attempt
 
06:18:12.548 --> 06:18:12.558 align:start position:0%
to find
 
06:18:15.468 --> 06:18:15.478 align:start position:0%
out for example what other states are
 
06:18:16.990 --> 06:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
doing to
 
06:18:21.350 --> 06:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
support nuclear energy I know there is a
 
06:18:24.190 --> 06:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
proposal before the Connecticut
 
06:18:27.310 --> 06:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
legislature to add nuclear to their
 
06:18:30.190 --> 06:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
RPS it hasn't been passed it's
 
06:18:32.990 --> 06:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
controversial but there is an attempt to
 
06:18:34.628 --> 06:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
do that down
 
06:18:37.230 --> 06:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
there and other states are likely to be
 
06:18:39.830 --> 06:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
doing something similar and the
 
06:18:42.430 --> 06:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
Department's investigation can find out
 
06:18:44.990 --> 06:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing and make
 
06:18:47.868 --> 06:18:47.878 align:start position:0%
recommendations about what we might be
 
06:18:50.030 --> 06:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
able to do here in New Hampshire to
 
06:18:52.590 --> 06:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
support nuclear energy we sort of had
 
06:18:55.910 --> 06:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
this discussion earlier today on how
 
06:18:55.920 --> 06:18:57.750 align:start position:0%
this discussion earlier today on how
House

06:18:57.750 --> 06:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
House
 
06:19:00.708 --> 06:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
Bill well I forgotten the number now but
 
06:19:02.468 --> 06:19:02.478 align:start position:0%
the house bill that Keith anman
 
06:19:06.310 --> 06:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
introduced that was recommended by his
 
06:19:08.990 --> 06:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh commission that studied nuclear
 
06:19:11.390 --> 06:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
energy for the better part of a year
 
06:19:13.350 --> 06:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
which was the result of a bill we passed
 
06:19:15.510 --> 06:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
out of this committee last year or the
 
06:19:18.868 --> 06:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
year before so I think there is an
 
06:19:21.430 --> 06:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
appetite I think there is a
 
06:19:24.390 --> 06:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
recognition that we need to figure out a
 
06:19:28.110 --> 06:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
way to raised the Public's awareness
 
06:19:30.670 --> 06:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
that if we're looking for non-carbon
 
06:19:30.680 --> 06:19:31.948 align:start position:0%
that if we're looking for non-carbon
emitting

06:19:31.948 --> 06:19:31.958 align:start position:0%
emitting
 
06:19:36.150 --> 06:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
energy nucle nuclear energy
 
06:19:39.628 --> 06:19:39.638 align:start position:0%
is probably the best source that we can
 
06:19:42.708 --> 06:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
find and if we can find ways to support
 
06:19:45.390 --> 06:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
it support its
 
06:19:48.070 --> 06:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
development then we need to do that we
 
06:19:50.468 --> 06:19:50.478 align:start position:0%
need to save the nuclear plants that are
 
06:19:53.510 --> 06:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
in existence today for example Seabrook
 
06:19:56.910 --> 06:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
is licensed through 2050
 
06:20:00.468 --> 06:20:00.478 align:start position:0%
and it would be pretty detrimental I
 
06:20:02.750 --> 06:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
think to ISO New England and to New
 
06:20:06.150 --> 06:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically
 
06:20:10.510 --> 06:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
if seab Brook was to be decommissioned
 
06:20:10.520 --> 06:20:11.628 align:start position:0%
if seab Brook was to be decommissioned
before

06:20:11.628 --> 06:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
before
 
06:20:15.548 --> 06:20:15.558 align:start position:0%
2050 2050 is not that far away it might
 
06:20:16.990 --> 06:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
seem like it
 
06:20:20.910 --> 06:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
but uh as someone of a certain age I can
 
06:20:24.070 --> 06:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
tell you the 25 years between now and
 
06:20:28.310 --> 06:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:31.390 --> 06:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
so that's the essence of what this bill
 
06:20:34.110 --> 06:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
is you can read the specifics here and
 
06:20:37.468 --> 06:20:37.478 align:start position:0%
we can discuss them we can either do it
 
06:20:40.390 --> 06:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
at this public hearing this afternoon
 
06:20:43.990 --> 06:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
I'll take notes or we can wait uh for a
 
06:20:46.190 --> 06:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
work session and maybe discuss some of
 
06:20:49.670 --> 06:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
the language at that time so I'm not
 
06:20:51.310 --> 06:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
going to say anything more about it for
 
06:20:53.830 --> 06:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
now I'll uh entertain your questions if
 
06:20:58.030 --> 06:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
you want to want to ask them and uh then
 
06:20:59.510 --> 06:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
I guess there'll be other people behind
 
06:21:03.070 --> 06:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
me who will chime in on this uh
 
06:21:06.270 --> 06:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
particular issue so thank you well I
 
06:21:08.750 --> 06:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
have a question um I'll do the prog
 
06:21:10.788 --> 06:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
first is uh number one I assume when
 
06:21:14.190 --> 06:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the uh the um uh
 
06:21:16.510 --> 06:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy you're talking about a
 
06:21:20.590 --> 06:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
dispatchable form of of U of energy in
 
06:21:22.230 --> 06:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
terms of what we really need to
 
06:21:24.350 --> 06:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
concentrate on if if we lose that we
 
06:21:27.548 --> 06:21:27.558 align:start position:0%
lose a a a large portion of dispatchable
 
06:21:30.350 --> 06:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
type energy as opposed to the um
 
06:21:32.230 --> 06:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
renewable which is uh you know not
 
06:21:32.240 --> 06:21:33.750 align:start position:0%
renewable which is uh you know not
always

06:21:33.750 --> 06:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
always
 
06:21:36.310 --> 06:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
reliable exactly that's why nuclear is
 
06:21:39.270 --> 06:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
so key because it's dispatchable right
 
06:21:41.910 --> 06:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
and uh that's why we need to preserve
 
06:21:45.430 --> 06:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
what we have and develop new sources of
 
06:21:47.708 --> 06:21:47.718 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy in the future yeah and my
 
06:21:51.190 --> 06:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up comment would be the um if I
 
06:21:52.990 --> 06:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
remember correctly this would be kind of
 
06:21:56.190 --> 06:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
in line with a notice that ISO New
 
06:21:58.190 --> 06:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
England put out a couple of years ago in
 
06:22:01.510 --> 06:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
terms of a um feeling that we are at
 
06:22:05.750 --> 06:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
risk for brownouts due to um lack of
 
06:22:07.948 --> 06:22:07.958 align:start position:0%
generators that may be falling offline
 
06:22:09.628 --> 06:22:09.638 align:start position:0%
or the amount of years it may take to
 
06:22:12.270 --> 06:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
bring new generators online and so they
 
06:22:15.670 --> 06:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
issued a a warning for the utilities to
 
06:22:17.948 --> 06:22:17.958 align:start position:0%
develop a plan of attack should a brown
 
06:22:21.510 --> 06:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
out happen so this would fall in line
 
06:22:24.590 --> 06:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
with us us to prepare for and look at
 
06:22:29.110 --> 06:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
future uh Electrical uh uh generation
 
06:22:32.190 --> 06:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities absolutely not just ISO
 
06:22:36.030 --> 06:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
New England but nerk the North
 
06:22:39.070 --> 06:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
American uh energy reliability Council
 
06:22:42.350 --> 06:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
which is under the as opes of
 
06:22:46.030 --> 06:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
FK U their primary responsibility is
 
06:22:49.030 --> 06:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
reliability and they're warning us they
 
06:22:51.830 --> 06:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
have wond us repeatedly in the last year
 
06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
and a half that our grid is becoming
 
06:22:58.590 --> 06:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
less and less Rel iable due to premature
 
06:23:01.948 --> 06:23:01.958 align:start position:0%
generation plant closings and to the uh
 
06:23:04.830 --> 06:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
development of more uh renewable energy
 
06:23:06.910 --> 06:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
resources which are not spinning
 
06:23:09.830 --> 06:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
resources and can destabilize the grid
 
06:23:11.948 --> 06:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
without a lot of el additional
 
06:23:16.190 --> 06:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
electrical equipment to maintain the uh
 
06:23:19.350 --> 06:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
electrical stability of the grid
 
06:23:22.708 --> 06:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot here that has to be
 
06:23:26.670 --> 06:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
done and um as asking the doe to look
 
06:23:28.230 --> 06:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
into this question I think is a good
 
06:23:29.868 --> 06:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
place to
 
06:23:32.150 --> 06:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
start okay question that representative
 
06:23:34.548 --> 06:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
Ms has a question thank you and thank
 
06:23:37.990 --> 06:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for taking my question um
 
06:23:39.750 --> 06:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry if I missed this but it
 
06:23:44.270 --> 06:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
sounded like um your your real original
 
06:23:45.910 --> 06:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill and what you'd like
 
06:23:48.190 --> 06:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
to get back to is to focus specifically
 
06:23:49.868 --> 06:23:49.878 align:start position:0%
on nuclear is that
 
06:23:54.070 --> 06:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
correct yes I think nuclear is the our
 
06:23:57.788 --> 06:23:57.798 align:start position:0%
best chance going forward to find a
 
06:24:00.590 --> 06:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
non-carbon emitting resource that can
 
06:24:03.110 --> 06:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
provide the amount of electricity that
 
06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to need in the future
 
06:24:09.070 --> 06:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
followup followup you you started your
 
06:24:10.910 --> 06:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
um your testimony by talking about
 
06:24:12.830 --> 06:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
reliability and how important that was
 
06:24:14.468 --> 06:24:14.478 align:start position:0%
and I don't think anybody disagrees with
 
06:24:18.070 --> 06:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
you if that is the concern wouldn't it
 
06:24:19.830 --> 06:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
be worthwhile if we're going to ask the
 
06:24:21.628 --> 06:24:21.638 align:start position:0%
department of energy to do a study to
 
06:24:24.548 --> 06:24:24.558 align:start position:0%
look at the reliability of all different
 
06:24:27.830 --> 06:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
all energy sources so that we get a true
 
06:24:30.390 --> 06:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
picture of where things
 
06:24:32.708 --> 06:24:32.718 align:start position:0%
stand I don't think the department of
 
06:24:35.590 --> 06:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
energy is the right organization to do
 
06:24:35.600 --> 06:24:36.948 align:start position:0%
energy is the right organization to do
that

06:24:36.948 --> 06:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:24:40.548 --> 06:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
examination reliability in New Hampshire
 
06:24:43.708 --> 06:24:43.718 align:start position:0%
and in ISO New England states is the
 
06:24:45.990 --> 06:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility of iso New England and
 
06:24:49.310 --> 06:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
they do do reliability studies they
 
06:24:51.150 --> 06:24:51.160 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time analyzing
 
06:24:53.270 --> 06:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
reliability there are reliability
 
06:24:56.190 --> 06:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
studies out there available for oo
 
06:24:59.030 --> 06:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
England in addition to that there's lots
 
06:25:03.590 --> 06:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
of reliability studies from nerk and
 
06:25:06.350 --> 06:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
other organizations so there's
 
06:25:09.670 --> 06:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
not an absence of reliability studies
 
06:25:12.270 --> 06:25:12.280 align:start position:0%
out there there's plenty of them and I
 
06:25:15.110 --> 06:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
don't think the asking the doe to do
 
06:25:18.110 --> 06:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
undertake such a reliability study would
 
06:25:18.120 --> 06:25:19.990 align:start position:0%
undertake such a reliability study would
augment

06:25:19.990 --> 06:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
augment
 
06:25:22.910 --> 06:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
the information that's already extent on
 
06:25:22.920 --> 06:25:24.270 align:start position:0%
the information that's already extent on
the

06:25:24.270 --> 06:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:25:24.280 --> 06:25:26.628 align:start position:0%
the
subject

06:25:26.628 --> 06:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
subject
 
06:25:28.990 --> 06:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
06:25:30.628 --> 06:25:30.638 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
06:25:34.110 --> 06:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
question uh so as as you often ask we
 
06:25:35.548 --> 06:25:35.558 align:start position:0%
should look at the text of the bill so
 
06:25:38.270 --> 06:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the text of the bill and
 
06:25:42.708 --> 06:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
uh when I look at um me here
 
06:25:47.868 --> 06:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
line oh lines 10 and 11 um so uh lines
 
06:25:50.548 --> 06:25:50.558 align:start position:0%
10 11 in particular talks about nuclear
 
06:25:53.750 --> 06:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
Advanced geothermal and storage
 
06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
Technologies um so in in your view as
 
06:25:59.590 --> 06:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
this Bill gets amended would the
 
06:26:02.070 --> 06:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
geothermal and storage technology still
 
06:26:04.070 --> 06:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
be considered part of the bill or are
 
06:26:05.390 --> 06:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
you thinking of dropping those out and
 
06:26:08.070 --> 06:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
just focusing on nuclear I'd be willing
 
06:26:11.510 --> 06:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
to discuss leaving those in with regard
 
06:26:13.830 --> 06:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
to those two particular lines I think we
 
06:26:15.548 --> 06:26:15.558 align:start position:0%
should probably
 
06:26:19.230 --> 06:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
delete a definition of clean energy
 
06:26:21.030 --> 06:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
there is no current definition of clean
 
06:26:24.190 --> 06:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
energy and Statute in New Hampshire and
 
06:26:26.230 --> 06:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty
 
06:26:26.240 --> 06:26:28.030 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty
broad

06:26:28.030 --> 06:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
broad
 
06:26:32.150 --> 06:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
open-ended uh term that's used to mean a
 
06:26:34.350 --> 06:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
lot of different things these days so I
 
06:26:36.590 --> 06:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
think we should probably get rid of that
 
06:26:39.910 --> 06:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
term Al together and focus on non-carbon
 
06:26:39.920 --> 06:26:42.190 align:start position:0%
term Al together and focus on non-carbon
emitting

06:26:42.190 --> 06:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
emitting
 
06:26:45.750 --> 06:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
Technologies and I included Advanced
 
06:26:49.310 --> 06:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:52.468 --> 06:26:52.478 align:start position:0%
Technologies for a reason and that is to
 
06:26:55.310 --> 06:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
indicate that while I think nuclear is
 
06:26:59.670 --> 06:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
is key it's not the only non-carbon
 
06:27:02.310 --> 06:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
emitting technology that out there that
 
06:27:05.310 --> 06:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
might be worthy of some
 
06:27:07.708 --> 06:27:07.718 align:start position:0%
support now if we're going to try to
 
06:27:10.310 --> 06:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
narrow the focus of this investigation
 
06:27:13.948 --> 06:27:13.958 align:start position:0%
we might have to drop those because
 
06:27:17.628 --> 06:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
um it might it might be involve too much
 
06:27:19.750 --> 06:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
work on the part of the department to be
 
06:27:23.190 --> 06:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
able to handle that too but I thought it
 
06:27:25.788 --> 06:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
was at least worth exploring exploring
 
06:27:27.590 --> 06:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
whether those two things should be part
 
06:27:30.310 --> 06:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
of the equation or
 
06:27:33.868 --> 06:27:33.878 align:start position:0%
not representative partial has a
 
06:27:36.510 --> 06:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair and thank you
 
06:27:38.750 --> 06:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
06:27:41.430 --> 06:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
um I've heard reliability is something
 
06:27:42.628 --> 06:27:42.638 align:start position:0%
to look at and I've heard about
 
06:27:45.510 --> 06:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
dispatchability and I guess one of my
 
06:27:48.868 --> 06:27:48.878 align:start position:0%
questions is um well there's two I'll
 
06:27:52.270 --> 06:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
that's them all together one is my
 
06:27:55.310 --> 06:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is while nuclear is a good
 
06:27:59.310 --> 06:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
base load supplier of energy it lacks
 
06:28:02.390 --> 06:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
somewhat in its dispatchability
 
06:28:05.670 --> 06:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
um that's one concern I would have the
 
06:28:07.030 --> 06:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
other which I'm
 
06:28:10.708 --> 06:28:10.718 align:start position:0%
really thinking is that if we are
 
06:28:13.670 --> 06:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
looking at nuclear as as part of this
 
06:28:17.110 --> 06:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
bill but not investigating other um
 
06:28:18.830 --> 06:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
alternatives are we getting a clear
 
06:28:22.670 --> 06:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
picture of what our best path forward is
 
06:28:23.990 --> 06:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot of talk about being
 
06:28:26.468 --> 06:28:26.478 align:start position:0%
energy agnostic in this committee and
 
06:28:28.110 --> 06:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if something like this is
 
06:28:30.708 --> 06:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
actually putting our thumb on a
 
06:28:33.990 --> 06:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
particular uh
 
06:28:36.030 --> 06:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
technology and and and I'm I'm I'm
 
06:28:39.430 --> 06:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
asking this because I really don't
 
06:28:42.708 --> 06:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
know it may sound like I okay thank you
 
06:28:45.110 --> 06:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
I'll answer your first question or your
 
06:28:50.030 --> 06:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:52.230 --> 06:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
agnosticism the reason I
 
06:28:54.990 --> 06:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
added Advanced geothermal and storage te
 
06:28:56.670 --> 06:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
Technologies was to make it a little
 
06:28:59.150 --> 06:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
more energy
 
06:29:01.990 --> 06:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
agnostic but as I said just a moment ago
 
06:29:04.910 --> 06:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
it may broaden the investigation to the
 
06:29:07.548 --> 06:29:07.558 align:start position:0%
point where it becomes too much for the
 
06:29:09.830 --> 06:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
Department to handle so we might have to
 
06:29:13.310 --> 06:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
think about removing that would it be
 
06:29:16.750 --> 06:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
nice to leave it in yes and maybe the
 
06:29:18.390 --> 06:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
department can tell us later whether
 
06:29:20.430 --> 06:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
they could handle something like that or
 
06:29:22.628 --> 06:29:22.638 align:start position:0%
not you other question about the
 
06:29:25.990 --> 06:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
dispatchability of nuclear I think once
 
06:29:28.110 --> 06:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
you have a chance to read and I think
 
06:29:30.830 --> 06:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
every Committee Member has now a copy of
 
06:29:34.150 --> 06:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
the report done by the nuclear study
 
06:29:35.510 --> 06:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
commission that we set up with House
 
06:29:35.520 --> 06:29:36.510 align:start position:0%
commission that we set up with House
Bill

06:29:36.510 --> 06:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
06:29:38.590 --> 06:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
543 I think when you have a chance to
 
06:29:41.868 --> 06:29:41.878 align:start position:0%
read that report you'll see that small
 
06:29:44.830 --> 06:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactors are more will be more
 
06:29:47.110 --> 06:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
able to deal with questions of
 
06:29:51.270 --> 06:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
dispatchability than the large um
 
06:29:54.030 --> 06:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
lightwater reactors that we have today
 
06:29:58.110 --> 06:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
so while it's probably true that nuclear
 
06:29:58.120 --> 06:29:59.350 align:start position:0%
so while it's probably true that nuclear
is

06:29:59.350 --> 06:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:30:02.270 --> 06:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
not quickly dispatchable
 
06:30:06.390 --> 06:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
today that may not be the case in the
 
06:30:10.110 --> 06:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:12.670 --> 06:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair or Mr Vice
 
06:30:16.030 --> 06:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
chair um on line uh
 
06:30:19.628 --> 06:30:19.638 align:start position:0%
22 um you talk about cyber security and
 
06:30:21.628 --> 06:30:21.638 align:start position:0%
and physical security standards for
 
06:30:24.510 --> 06:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
clean energy am I understanding now that
 
06:30:26.390 --> 06:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
that it's the cyber security and
 
06:30:31.150 --> 06:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:35.070 --> 06:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
Nuclear So This is a artifact of the
 
06:30:38.150 --> 06:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
fact that I stole this oh language from
 
06:30:41.430 --> 06:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
the micro Grid bill and I think the
 
06:30:44.150 --> 06:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
department of Energy's concern about the
 
06:30:46.510 --> 06:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
broad nature of this
 
06:30:49.910 --> 06:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill is at least in part the result of
 
06:30:53.350 --> 06:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
their concern about the line you just
 
06:30:55.990 --> 06:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
cited cyber security and physical
 
06:30:58.670 --> 06:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
security may be outside the scope of
 
06:31:00.468 --> 06:31:00.478 align:start position:0%
something that they have the ability to
 
06:31:04.590 --> 06:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
do so I would argue that when we discuss
 
06:31:07.350 --> 06:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to try to amend
 
06:31:09.270 --> 06:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
this bill that might be something that
 
06:31:14.190 --> 06:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:17.070 --> 06:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
you represent keny did you have your can
 
06:31:20.270 --> 06:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
up yeah it's a it's a a question and
 
06:31:23.110 --> 06:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
sort of a comment too um yeah although
 
06:31:25.388 --> 06:31:25.398 align:start position:0%
nuclear is mainly designed to provide
 
06:31:28.548 --> 06:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
base load power to you know to have
 
06:31:31.510 --> 06:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactors that can load follow
 
06:31:33.350 --> 06:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
has been something that's of interest
 
06:31:36.310 --> 06:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
for you know 10 or 20 years I mean G
 
06:31:39.190 --> 06:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
Itachi has an ATM reactor they haven't
 
06:31:41.948 --> 06:31:41.958 align:start position:0%
built one but that's one that's been
 
06:31:43.990 --> 06:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
designed I I can't remember the exact
 
06:31:47.468 --> 06:31:47.478 align:start position:0%
rate of you know load following that
 
06:31:49.948 --> 06:31:49.958 align:start position:0%
it's capable of but I mean if there is a
 
06:31:51.948 --> 06:31:51.958 align:start position:0%
concern there I mean that is something
 
06:31:54.468 --> 06:31:54.478 align:start position:0%
that you know designers of new nuclear
 
06:31:56.510 --> 06:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
re actors are thinking
 
06:31:59.830 --> 06:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
about not a question I guess no not a
 
06:32:02.468 --> 06:32:02.478 align:start position:0%
question but uh thank you for pointing
 
06:32:05.468 --> 06:32:05.478 align:start position:0%
that out uh I stated
 
06:32:08.430 --> 06:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
that in more broad terms just a moment
 
06:32:11.468 --> 06:32:11.478 align:start position:0%
ago but your specifics are are
 
06:32:13.708 --> 06:32:13.718 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
06:32:16.708 --> 06:32:16.718 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr Vice chairman um yeah
 
06:32:19.670 --> 06:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
my question is just in my comment is
 
06:32:21.948 --> 06:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
kind of a follow on to the last couple
 
06:32:24.150 --> 06:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
of questions I was I was gratified to
 
06:32:27.708 --> 06:32:27.718 align:start position:0%
see that you um in fact had
 
06:32:29.510 --> 06:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
included uh the
 
06:32:32.070 --> 06:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
term storage
 
06:32:36.070 --> 06:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
Technologies because going to the
 
06:32:40.230 --> 06:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
comments earlier and the concern about
 
06:32:43.548 --> 06:32:43.558 align:start position:0%
energy sources being
 
06:32:43.558 --> 06:32:45.750 align:start position:0%
energy sources being
dispatchable

06:32:45.750 --> 06:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
dispatchable
 
06:32:49.948 --> 06:32:49.958 align:start position:0%
storage makes renewable Technologies
 
06:32:49.958 --> 06:32:52.708 align:start position:0%
storage makes renewable Technologies
dispatchable

06:32:52.708 --> 06:32:52.718 align:start position:0%
dispatchable
 
06:32:56.990 --> 06:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I certainly would like to see the
 
06:33:03.150 --> 06:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
inclusion of wind and solar energy in
 
06:33:06.150 --> 06:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
any kind of study of energy resources
 
06:33:08.830 --> 06:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
that are being were being undertaken
 
06:33:12.708 --> 06:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
along with storage capacity because I
 
06:33:15.910 --> 06:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
won't I won't repeat myself uh that
 
06:33:19.590 --> 06:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
makes that makes sense
 
06:33:23.548 --> 06:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'll just leave it
 
06:33:26.110 --> 06:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
there well I didn't exactly hear a
 
06:33:28.270 --> 06:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
question there but I will say based on
 
06:33:30.628 --> 06:33:30.638 align:start position:0%
what you what you what your statement
 
06:33:33.868 --> 06:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
was that that would broaden the scope of
 
06:33:35.830 --> 06:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
this investigation to the point where
 
06:33:38.750 --> 06:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the doe couldn't handle it so
 
06:33:41.670 --> 06:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of trying to focus
 
06:33:45.430 --> 06:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
this investigation is to produce
 
06:33:48.190 --> 06:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
something that would be useful but still
 
06:33:50.548 --> 06:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
within the scope of what the department
 
06:33:50.558 --> 06:33:51.388 align:start position:0%
within the scope of what the department
can

06:33:51.388 --> 06:33:51.398 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:33:55.510 --> 06:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
handle and I think we know aot
 
06:33:55.520 --> 06:33:57.150 align:start position:0%
handle and I think we know aot
about

06:33:57.150 --> 06:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:34:01.590 --> 06:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh wind energy we have within state
 
06:34:03.590 --> 06:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
government right now the office of
 
06:34:06.110 --> 06:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
offshore wind development so I don't
 
06:34:08.430 --> 06:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
think we need to
 
06:34:11.468 --> 06:34:11.478 align:start position:0%
uh lump
 
06:34:15.150 --> 06:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
wind into this study storage
 
06:34:19.110 --> 06:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
maybe because storage while you're right
 
06:34:20.868 --> 06:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
it can deal to some degree with the
 
06:34:23.468 --> 06:34:23.478 align:start position:0%
dispatchability of renewable
 
06:34:26.430 --> 06:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
energy right now storage is incredibly
 
06:34:29.788 --> 06:34:29.798 align:start position:0%
expensive and pretty Limited in its
 
06:34:33.788 --> 06:34:33.798 align:start position:0%
capability so um I don't know to what
 
06:34:36.910 --> 06:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
degree storage could will be useful
 
06:34:39.030 --> 06:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
going forward unless somebody comes up
 
06:34:39.040 --> 06:34:39.868 align:start position:0%
going forward unless somebody comes up
with

06:34:39.868 --> 06:34:39.878 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:34:43.670 --> 06:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
a a new way to do it but certainly if
 
06:34:45.270 --> 06:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
somebody does come up with a new way of
 
06:34:47.628 --> 06:34:47.638 align:start position:0%
doing it it it'll be extremely
 
06:34:50.388 --> 06:34:50.398 align:start position:0%
invaluable and
 
06:34:52.788 --> 06:34:52.798 align:start position:0%
important okay I think we're starting to
 
06:34:55.310 --> 06:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
cover the same territory so I'd like to
 
06:34:55.320 --> 06:34:57.150 align:start position:0%
cover the same territory so I'd like to
give

06:34:57.150 --> 06:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
give
 
06:34:59.670 --> 06:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh well I'll give the last two questions
 
06:35:03.388 --> 06:35:03.398 align:start position:0%
I'll go with uh representative uh McGee
 
06:35:05.430 --> 06:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
first and then we'll finish with the
 
06:35:08.510 --> 06:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative JD Bernardi
 
06:35:11.510 --> 06:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
06:35:15.628 --> 06:35:15.638 align:start position:0%
Mr current chair um okay
 
06:35:17.990 --> 06:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the letter from the
 
06:35:20.030 --> 06:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and their
 
06:35:22.468 --> 06:35:22.478 align:start position:0%
discussion of sort of the regional
 
06:35:24.030 --> 06:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
reporting that's available in terms of
 
06:35:26.990 --> 06:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
the grid G stability and you started out
 
06:35:28.750 --> 06:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
saying that your concern for grid
 
06:35:31.868 --> 06:35:31.878 align:start position:0%
stability was where this began and then
 
06:35:34.868 --> 06:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
some of the language came from a micro
 
06:35:37.910 --> 06:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know other bills so so it's I can
 
06:35:39.110 --> 06:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
understand the department of energy
 
06:35:40.468 --> 06:35:40.478 align:start position:0%
saying hey if you're going to give us
 
06:35:43.670 --> 06:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
something tell us how to get there so my
 
06:35:47.750 --> 06:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
question is should we maybe Focus um
 
06:35:49.590 --> 06:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
thinking now and even in our work
 
06:35:51.270 --> 06:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
session on the outcomes that we're
 
06:35:54.030 --> 06:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve because we all have
 
06:35:55.628 --> 06:35:55.638 align:start position:0%
our opinions
 
06:35:58.868 --> 06:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
about uh reliability and dispatchability
 
06:35:58.878 --> 06:36:00.388 align:start position:0%
about uh reliability and dispatchability
and

06:36:00.388 --> 06:36:00.398 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:04.110 --> 06:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
preferences but it looks like um since
 
06:36:05.468 --> 06:36:05.478 align:start position:0%
we don't have a plan that we're
 
06:36:07.948 --> 06:36:07.958 align:start position:0%
following in terms of uh what we're
 
06:36:11.270 --> 06:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
trying to transition in our Energy
 
06:36:12.830 --> 06:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
System right we're not following a
 
06:36:14.948 --> 06:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
blueprint right now of where we need to
 
06:36:17.150 --> 06:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
get to so we're kind of throwing stuff
 
06:36:20.868 --> 06:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
out there I'm wondering if we could talk
 
06:36:23.350 --> 06:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
about what the outcomes we would like
 
06:36:25.310 --> 06:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
them to present us with when we get that
 
06:36:27.150 --> 06:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
report back
 
06:36:31.628 --> 06:36:31.638 align:start position:0%
are um because I'm I think they would be
 
06:36:35.350 --> 06:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
informed by all of the um planning
 
06:36:38.310 --> 06:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
reports that are available through ISO
 
06:36:40.948 --> 06:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
on what's being looked at in terms of
 
06:36:40.958 --> 06:36:41.788 align:start position:0%
on what's being looked at in terms of
grid

06:36:41.788 --> 06:36:41.798 align:start position:0%
grid
 
06:36:44.070 --> 06:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
reliability and I I I don't want us to
 
06:36:46.190 --> 06:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
go into it asking them to come out with
 
06:36:47.948 --> 06:36:47.958 align:start position:0%
the solution that we're prescribing
 
06:36:50.788 --> 06:36:50.798 align:start position:0%
right I want to see them give us
 
06:36:53.468 --> 06:36:53.478 align:start position:0%
information uh of what's going to create
 
06:36:55.030 --> 06:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
a stable grid the
 
06:36:57.190 --> 06:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
future um or you know what are we trying
 
06:36:59.628 --> 06:36:59.638 align:start position:0%
to get to in 5 or 10 years
 
06:37:05.230 --> 06:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
so um I guess my question would be are
 
06:37:08.030 --> 06:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
you open to make if this bill is going
 
06:37:10.468 --> 06:37:10.478 align:start position:0%
to be a study uh from the Department of
 
06:37:13.070 --> 06:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
energy then are you open to the idea of
 
06:37:15.190 --> 06:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
us figuring out what questions they need
 
06:37:18.990 --> 06:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
to answer just give them a list of what
 
06:37:20.510 --> 06:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
they need to come back to us with so
 
06:37:23.190 --> 06:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
that we can do something with
 
06:37:27.030 --> 06:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
that well the language of the bill does
 
06:37:30.750 --> 06:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
State what we want the outome to be in
 
06:37:34.990 --> 06:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
lines 26 and 27 it says
 
06:37:38.110 --> 06:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
provide that the investigation will
 
06:37:40.150 --> 06:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
produce a report that provides financial
 
06:37:40.160 --> 06:37:41.110 align:start position:0%
produce a report that provides financial
and

06:37:41.110 --> 06:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:37:44.590 --> 06:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
Regulatory support for non-carbon
 
06:37:47.510 --> 06:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
emitting energy electricity generation
 
06:37:49.750 --> 06:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
that balances Economic Development grid
 
06:37:51.990 --> 06:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
stability security costs and potential
 
06:37:54.990 --> 06:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
impacts that kind of thing
 
06:37:57.468 --> 06:37:57.478 align:start position:0%
so we do know what we would like to see
 
06:38:02.310 --> 06:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
for an a result uh so to your
 
06:38:04.708 --> 06:38:04.718 align:start position:0%
question Are there specific questions
 
06:38:09.110 --> 06:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
that we can ask to get that result and I
 
06:38:10.708 --> 06:38:10.718 align:start position:0%
would argue
 
06:38:13.990 --> 06:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
that potentially yes we can we can
 
06:38:17.350 --> 06:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
rework the language of a through H
 
06:38:21.070 --> 06:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
eliminating G to make sure we ask the
 
06:38:23.628 --> 06:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
right questions to get the output that
 
06:38:25.070 --> 06:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
we want
 
06:38:29.708 --> 06:38:29.718 align:start position:0%
uh as listed in lines 25 through 27 yes
 
06:38:32.750 --> 06:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
and and in followup followup yeah so I
 
06:38:35.230 --> 06:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
uh had un underlined those as well I had
 
06:38:36.830 --> 06:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
underlined those lines because they do
 
06:38:39.230 --> 06:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
give specificity but they are still
 
06:38:42.270 --> 06:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
quite Broad and I think the issue that
 
06:38:44.388 --> 06:38:44.398 align:start position:0%
comes out here is that these Concepts
 
06:38:47.350 --> 06:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
while good uh can be balanced very
 
06:38:49.030 --> 06:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
different ways so if you're looking at
 
06:38:50.750 --> 06:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
Economic Development versus Grid
 
06:38:53.110 --> 06:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
stability versus security versus costs
 
06:38:55.190 --> 06:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
right you can can come at that a million
 
06:38:56.310 --> 06:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
different ways and come out with a lot
 
06:38:58.110 --> 06:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
of different answers so I would think
 
06:39:00.868 --> 06:39:00.878 align:start position:0%
that they would need more from us in
 
06:39:02.910 --> 06:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
order to figure out which way to weigh
 
06:39:04.910 --> 06:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
those things in terms of what we're
 
06:39:07.788 --> 06:39:07.798 align:start position:0%
trying to uh achieve so I think it's a
 
06:39:10.750 --> 06:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
great one for for a work
 
06:39:15.548 --> 06:39:15.558 align:start position:0%
session you could be right uh about um
 
06:39:18.150 --> 06:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
offering them more as a matter of fact I
 
06:39:20.830 --> 06:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
think you are right and I was H that the
 
06:39:22.150 --> 06:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee would agree to do a work
 
06:39:23.510 --> 06:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
session to see if we can come up with
 
06:39:26.070 --> 06:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
some of those specific
 
06:39:28.230 --> 06:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative Bary you
 
06:39:29.468 --> 06:39:29.478 align:start position:0%
have the last
 
06:39:34.070 --> 06:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
word thank you Mr Vice chair uh so is it
 
06:39:38.510 --> 06:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
within the scope of your concept of a of
 
06:39:40.270 --> 06:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
of a
 
06:39:43.750 --> 06:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
u a bill here to have the doe
 
06:39:46.868 --> 06:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
potentially contract with the Department
 
06:39:51.830 --> 06:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
of energy in Washington with and through
 
06:39:57.868 --> 06:39:57.878 align:start position:0%
un to uh get get some um funds to really
 
06:40:00.430 --> 06:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
understand what it would take to uh
 
06:40:04.150 --> 06:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
Advance nuclear engineering Solutions in
 
06:40:04.160 --> 06:40:04.948 align:start position:0%
Advance nuclear engineering Solutions in
New

06:40:04.948 --> 06:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
New
 
06:40:06.830 --> 06:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well I'm not going to speak
 
06:40:08.548 --> 06:40:08.558 align:start position:0%
for the Department of energy when they
 
06:40:11.830 --> 06:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
testify you can ask them um how they
 
06:40:14.590 --> 06:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
Envision this happening hiring a
 
06:40:16.948 --> 06:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
consultant I think might be something
 
06:40:20.990 --> 06:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
that they would lean toward or consider
 
06:40:23.230 --> 06:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
and there is no funding for that in this
 
06:40:27.030 --> 06:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
legislation so that would be an issue
 
06:40:28.468 --> 06:40:28.478 align:start position:0%
that we'd have to consider if we were
 
06:40:31.708 --> 06:40:31.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:34.548 --> 06:40:34.558 align:start position:0%
forward okay thank you uh I think we'll
 
06:40:37.270 --> 06:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
move on thank you representative o for
 
06:40:40.468 --> 06:40:40.478 align:start position:0%
your testimony and explanations and I
 
06:40:44.430 --> 06:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
will invite our last speaker Mr Griffin
 
06:40:48.150 --> 06:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
Rao from the Department of energy who re
 
06:40:52.070 --> 06:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me re I'm getting confused with v
 
06:40:54.990 --> 06:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
and RAR but uh I'm sure they will tell
 
06:40:56.548 --> 06:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
us everything we need to know about how
 
06:41:17.110 --> 06:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:20.628 --> 06:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
us thank you Mr chairman uh for the
 
06:41:22.510 --> 06:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
record Griffin Roberge State energy
 
06:41:24.430 --> 06:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
program manager at the New Hampshire
 
06:41:26.990 --> 06:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
Department of energy um as was
 
06:41:28.830 --> 06:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned and in a letter of
 
06:41:30.670 --> 06:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
testimony going around the room and in
 
06:41:33.590 --> 06:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
an email last night um the department is
 
06:41:36.270 --> 06:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill as introduced uh for
 
06:41:38.430 --> 06:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
many of the reasons that uh
 
06:41:41.510 --> 06:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative V had indicated um going
 
06:41:42.910 --> 06:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
through the bill and I'll just keep it
 
06:41:44.350 --> 06:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
at a fairly high level because I think
 
06:41:45.948 --> 06:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
most people might be familiar with the
 
06:41:49.590 --> 06:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
letter um the investigation topics are
 
06:41:51.030 --> 06:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
quite broad as they are currently
 
06:41:54.388 --> 06:41:54.398 align:start position:0%
written um some of them are more focused
 
06:41:56.990 --> 06:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh or looked at at Regional or national
 
06:42:00.830 --> 06:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
levels um as has been mentioned uh ISO
 
06:42:03.788 --> 06:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
New England does a number of um
 
06:42:06.468 --> 06:42:06.478 align:start position:0%
reliability studies um at the regional
 
06:42:08.510 --> 06:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
level um there's also been a couple of
 
06:42:12.708 --> 06:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
other uh related uh reports from enr um
 
06:42:16.070 --> 06:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
nerk uh other organizations such as that
 
06:42:20.150 --> 06:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
um given the broadness of the um
 
06:42:23.030 --> 06:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
investigation we did as noted in the
 
06:42:24.628 --> 06:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
fiscal note anticipate that the
 
06:42:27.350 --> 06:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
consultant costs uh to undertake this
 
06:42:30.030 --> 06:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
investigation could be north of
 
06:42:33.070 --> 06:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
$250,000 um we do not have the current
 
06:42:35.350 --> 06:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
Staffing Resources to man out a very
 
06:42:37.548 --> 06:42:37.558 align:start position:0%
broad investigation as is currently
 
06:42:40.830 --> 06:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
written um given that some of the tasks
 
06:42:43.430 --> 06:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
would likely Fall outside of the
 
06:42:44.990 --> 06:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
Department's regulation of electric
 
06:42:48.110 --> 06:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities um we could not
 
06:42:50.270 --> 06:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
assess the costs for that consultant to
 
06:42:52.468 --> 06:42:52.478 align:start position:0%
them so it would raise the question of
 
06:42:54.190 --> 06:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not it would be appro
 
06:42:57.510 --> 06:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
for uh a state appropriation be made to
 
06:43:00.070 --> 06:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
retain a consultant to do the study and
 
06:43:02.190 --> 06:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
then finally as has been mentioned um
 
06:43:04.270 --> 06:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
cyber security we would suggest removing
 
06:43:07.548 --> 06:43:07.558 align:start position:0%
that um section entirely in the bill as
 
06:43:09.310 --> 06:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
it's currently written um while the
 
06:43:10.708 --> 06:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
department does review some cyber
 
06:43:12.670 --> 06:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
security plans for our electric
 
06:43:15.548 --> 06:43:15.558 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities um doing it doing
 
06:43:18.030 --> 06:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
so for a variety of clean energy
 
06:43:20.788 --> 06:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
resources is could be highly sensitive
 
06:43:22.708 --> 06:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
very complex because is traditionally
 
06:43:26.310 --> 06:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
overseen by FK and nerk um I'm done with
 
06:43:28.430 --> 06:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
acronyms that concludes my testimony
 
06:43:30.788 --> 06:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Happy take any
 
06:43:35.230 --> 06:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:38.270 --> 06:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
Berardi Mr robar you heard my uh
 
06:43:42.388 --> 06:43:42.398 align:start position:0%
question to uh representative B earlier
 
06:43:45.430 --> 06:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
I hear that Contracting with the
 
06:43:49.708 --> 06:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
doe uh in Washington for some funds
 
06:43:52.750 --> 06:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
focused on getting Consultants as well
 
06:43:54.868 --> 06:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
as Maybe engag ing the University of New
 
06:43:58.468 --> 06:43:58.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they engineering folks in uh
 
06:44:01.030 --> 06:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
doing a comprehensive look at this issue
 
06:44:03.788 --> 06:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
sure and thank you for the question
 
06:44:07.990 --> 06:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
so in terms of Contracting I guess with
 
06:44:09.708 --> 06:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
the US Department of energy wouldn't
 
06:44:11.548 --> 06:44:11.558 align:start position:0%
just be something we contact them and we
 
06:44:14.270 --> 06:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
just do it usually they yeah I know uh
 
06:44:16.948 --> 06:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
usually they offer um competitive
 
06:44:20.548 --> 06:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
opportunities for um research grants and
 
06:44:22.230 --> 06:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
that type of thing and UNH certainly
 
06:44:23.670 --> 06:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
does have a history of applying to to
 
06:44:26.230 --> 06:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
some of them to uh procure funding to do
 
06:44:29.708 --> 06:44:29.718 align:start position:0%
studies but at times USD will offer that
 
06:44:33.150 --> 06:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
funding specifically for a certain area
 
06:44:36.070 --> 06:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
of study such as say solar or Hydro
 
06:44:39.110 --> 06:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
demonstrations or that type of thing um
 
06:44:40.388 --> 06:44:40.398 align:start position:0%
it's something we could certainly look
 
06:44:42.708 --> 06:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
into I'm not going to sit here today and
 
06:44:44.270 --> 06:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
pledge that there certainly is something
 
06:44:46.190 --> 06:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
that we could do in that vein so thank
 
06:44:47.150 --> 06:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
06:44:50.150 --> 06:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
06:44:53.548 --> 06:44:53.558 align:start position:0%
Mill thank you and thank you Mr Rob
 
06:44:55.430 --> 06:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question it just struck me as
 
06:44:58.750 --> 06:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
as we were talking about uh us doe and
 
06:45:00.670 --> 06:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
what's going on New Hampshire is
 
06:45:02.190 --> 06:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
currently putting together a climate
 
06:45:03.350 --> 06:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
action plan that they're going to be
 
06:45:05.468 --> 06:45:05.478 align:start position:0%
submitting for review to the feds in
 
06:45:09.230 --> 06:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
terms of funding of that plan and it's
 
06:45:11.788 --> 06:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
designed to look at a transition to more
 
06:45:11.798 --> 06:45:13.150 align:start position:0%
designed to look at a transition to more
non-emitting

06:45:13.150 --> 06:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
non-emitting
 
06:45:16.190 --> 06:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
um forms of energy so I'm wondering
 
06:45:18.830 --> 06:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
whether the bill could be converted into
 
06:45:21.628 --> 06:45:21.638 align:start position:0%
a bill to have doe work along with Dees
 
06:45:23.430 --> 06:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that nuclear is incl
 
06:45:26.110 --> 06:45:26.120 align:start position:0%
included in the plan that maybe you know
 
06:45:27.750 --> 06:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
because that's a plan that's actually
 
06:45:30.510 --> 06:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
forward- facing that's looking at how
 
06:45:32.948 --> 06:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
are we meeting our emissions lowering
 
06:45:35.670 --> 06:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
goals M and so that's a place where you
 
06:45:37.830 --> 06:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
maybe could get some traction and some
 
06:45:41.070 --> 06:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
money and some funding and some looks uh
 
06:45:43.830 --> 06:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
at a level where they actually have the
 
06:45:46.388 --> 06:45:46.398 align:start position:0%
expertise and the information about what
 
06:45:48.510 --> 06:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
the latest and greatest Technologies are
 
06:45:50.990 --> 06:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering if if we could
 
06:45:53.910 --> 06:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
Define what we were trying to achieve
 
06:45:56.270 --> 06:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
M uh in terms of bringing greater
 
06:45:58.310 --> 06:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
reliability to the regional grid as a
 
06:46:00.430 --> 06:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
state if we could be telling that to the
 
06:46:03.070 --> 06:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
doe as part of our plan then maybe that
 
06:46:06.030 --> 06:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
would be a way for us to get somewhere
 
06:46:08.110 --> 06:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
rather than just having another study
 
06:46:09.948 --> 06:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
yeah sure and uh thank you for the for
 
06:46:12.590 --> 06:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
the question so I I guess I could say it
 
06:46:14.310 --> 06:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
there's a potential maybe for that I'm
 
06:46:15.670 --> 06:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
not going to sit here and pledge that
 
06:46:18.150 --> 06:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
that is I would just know that you know
 
06:46:20.628 --> 06:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
I know Dees is the lead agency in
 
06:46:22.910 --> 06:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
crafting the state's climate action plan
 
06:46:24.590 --> 06:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I know that there are federal
 
06:46:26.548 --> 06:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
deadlines to get that plan in place I
 
06:46:28.788 --> 06:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
just wouldn't want to be putting Dees in
 
06:46:31.190 --> 06:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
a position to slow down the development
 
06:46:32.910 --> 06:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
of the plan waiting for this legislation
 
06:46:34.430 --> 06:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
to be sorted out so just something to
 
06:46:35.948 --> 06:46:35.958 align:start position:0%
consider but I understand the point
 
06:46:35.958 --> 06:46:40.070 align:start position:0%
consider but I understand the point
thank

06:46:40.070 --> 06:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:42.990 --> 06:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
you I have one last question just out of
 
06:46:46.110 --> 06:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
C uh curiosity do you see
 
06:46:49.830 --> 06:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
um considering this bill and the one we
 
06:46:50.990 --> 06:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
heard earlier
 
06:46:53.590 --> 06:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
1465 do you see where the two of them
 
06:46:55.548 --> 06:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
could be done like if if they were both
 
06:46:58.350 --> 06:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
passed would would they be combined in
 
06:47:02.510 --> 06:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
in in Doe's efforts sure I I I think I
 
06:47:04.468 --> 06:47:04.478 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying so um yes
 
06:47:06.270 --> 06:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question is that I I
 
06:47:07.388 --> 06:47:07.398 align:start position:0%
think that is something for this
 
06:47:08.830 --> 06:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
committee to consider is that those
 
06:47:11.270 --> 06:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
bills could potentially overlap one
 
06:47:13.190 --> 06:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
another so for example in the bill we
 
06:47:16.350 --> 06:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
heard earlier today House Bill 1465 that
 
06:47:18.070 --> 06:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
bill could potentially be creating a
 
06:47:20.830 --> 06:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
coordinat position at the department um
 
06:47:22.150 --> 06:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
depending on what the final bill
 
06:47:24.230 --> 06:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
language looks like if signed in the law
 
06:47:25.990 --> 06:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know it could be pre creating a
 
06:47:29.830 --> 06:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
coordinator position while also you know
 
06:47:31.350 --> 06:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I should back up a coordinator
 
06:47:33.468 --> 06:47:33.478 align:start position:0%
position that's responsible
 
06:47:36.510 --> 06:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
for uh compiling reports and continuing
 
06:47:38.590 --> 06:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
studies from State agencies on nuclear
 
06:47:40.948 --> 06:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
matters while also the department is
 
06:47:44.190 --> 06:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
doing a similar investigation in another
 
06:47:47.750 --> 06:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
vein so I I guess my they could
 
06:47:49.310 --> 06:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
complement each other but I would say
 
06:47:51.230 --> 06:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
that they could also overlap one another
 
06:47:53.708 --> 06:47:53.718 align:start position:0%
and be a little bit duplicative thank
 
06:47:56.030 --> 06:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other questions thank you
 
06:47:58.110 --> 06:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony thank you
 
06:48:00.948 --> 06:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
seeing no other pink cards or testifiers
 
06:48:06.670 --> 06:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:14.670 --> 06:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:18.070 --> 06:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
chair representative Ms has a question
 
06:48:21.070 --> 06:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to let uh my colleagues
 
06:48:23.868 --> 06:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
know that um representative Williams and
 
06:48:28.510 --> 06:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
I are uh working on an amendment to HB
 
06:48:31.310 --> 06:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
1472 which is the EV incentive pilot
 
06:48:34.270 --> 06:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
program I had hop to have a draft of the
 
06:48:36.628 --> 06:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
amendment available before we left today
 
06:48:37.910 --> 06:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
but what I'd like to do is just
 
06:48:40.030 --> 06:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
circulate kind of an outline for
 
06:48:41.590 --> 06:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
everyone that kind of gives them a sense
 
06:48:43.990 --> 06:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
of what will be in that that outline
 
06:48:47.708 --> 06:48:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:47.718 --> 06:48:49.590 align:start position:0%
 
tomorrow

06:48:49.590 --> 06:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
06:48:54.628 --> 06:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we completed our work
 
06:48:54.638 --> 06:48:56.230 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we completed our work
for

06:48:56.230 --> 06:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:48:59.750 --> 06:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
today at least our public hearing work
 
06:49:03.190 --> 06:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
all of us have homework however because
 
06:49:06.388 --> 06:49:06.398 align:start position:0%
during the course of the day we have
 
06:49:08.990 --> 06:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
circulated a number of
 
06:49:11.910 --> 06:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
amendments that we will be considering
 
06:49:13.990 --> 06:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
during exec session
 
06:49:18.388 --> 06:49:18.398 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and um so I hope that each of
 
06:49:21.468 --> 06:49:21.478 align:start position:0%
you will go home tonight with these
 
06:49:24.350 --> 06:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
amendments and study them and come
 
06:49:29.350 --> 06:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow prepared to discuss them and U
 
06:49:30.910 --> 06:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
pass judgment on
 
06:49:30.920 --> 06:49:34.070 align:start position:0%
pass judgment on
them

06:49:34.070 --> 06:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:38.830 --> 06:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
now I didn't realize at the time that we
 
06:49:42.230 --> 06:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that we would need more time on
 
06:49:44.868 --> 06:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:49.030 --> 06:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 1465 so I scheduled that for exec
 
06:49:51.830 --> 06:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
session tomorrow but representative
 
06:49:53.590 --> 06:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
Harrington and representative
 
06:49:57.310 --> 06:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
muns would like to work together on an
 
06:50:02.510 --> 06:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh creates a single
 
06:50:04.750 --> 06:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
position within the department of
 
06:50:04.760 --> 06:50:06.430 align:start position:0%
position within the department of
energy

06:50:06.430 --> 06:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
energy
 
06:50:10.070 --> 06:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
to accumulate and report on all the
 
06:50:12.270 --> 06:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
information that all these other
 
06:50:14.030 --> 06:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
departments that are listed in statute
 
06:50:18.150 --> 06:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
are currently charged with trying to uh
 
06:50:21.590 --> 06:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
capture so we're going to need more time
 
06:50:24.430 --> 06:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
obviously to work on that so tomorrow
 
06:50:26.990 --> 06:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the exec session on
 
06:50:27.000 --> 06:50:28.230 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the exec session on
hb1

06:50:28.230 --> 06:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
06:50:33.030 --> 06:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
1465 and then immediately recess it so
 
06:50:35.750 --> 06:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
that representative Harrington and muns
 
06:50:37.948 --> 06:50:37.958 align:start position:0%
can work together on an amendment to
 
06:50:37.958 --> 06:50:39.190 align:start position:0%
can work together on an amendment to
that

06:50:39.190 --> 06:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:50:39.200 --> 06:50:40.708 align:start position:0%
that
bill

06:50:40.708 --> 06:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:50:43.628 --> 06:50:43.638 align:start position:0%
and since we're also considering that
 
06:50:46.868 --> 06:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
maybe the bill that we just heard hb1
 
06:50:51.948 --> 06:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
1644 might dovetail somehow with
 
06:50:55.510 --> 06:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
1465 maybe we'll try to Acom um
 
06:50:57.788 --> 06:50:57.798 align:start position:0%
accomplish some kind of an amalgamation
 
06:51:01.510 --> 06:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
of those two bills um at the same time
 
06:51:03.430 --> 06:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
I'll let representative muns and
 
06:51:06.110 --> 06:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington look at that
 
06:51:08.750 --> 06:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
question to see if there's an
 
06:51:08.760 --> 06:51:10.310 align:start position:0%
question to see if there's an
opportunity

06:51:10.310 --> 06:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
06:51:10.320 --> 06:51:11.830 align:start position:0%
opportunity
for

06:51:11.830 --> 06:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:51:15.590 --> 06:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh for us to make put those two bills
 
06:51:18.468 --> 06:51:18.478 align:start position:0%
together somehow if
 
06:51:21.150 --> 06:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
possible but other than that we will go
 
06:51:24.070 --> 06:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
through the other bills
 
06:51:27.548 --> 06:51:27.558 align:start position:0%
um that are listed in the calendar for
 
06:51:30.670 --> 06:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and we'll pass judgment on all
 
06:51:32.990 --> 06:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
of those and we've got amendments I
 
06:51:34.548 --> 06:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
think for just about every single one of
 
06:51:39.150 --> 06:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
them so it'll be a busy time and um I'll
 
06:51:40.990 --> 06:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
look forward to seeing everybody here
 
06:51:44.270 --> 06:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
tomorrow now I know that representative
 
06:51:44.280 --> 06:51:45.350 align:start position:0%
tomorrow now I know that representative
liwicki

06:51:45.350 --> 06:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
liwicki
 
06:51:50.548 --> 06:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
has an appointment at 2:15 off site but
 
06:51:55.310 --> 06:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:58.548 --> 06:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
so hopefully uh everybody will be able
 
06:52:00.310 --> 06:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
to be here tomorrow we haven't heard
 
06:52:04.750 --> 06:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
recently from Representatives Summers
 
06:52:07.310 --> 06:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
rney uh MC
 
06:52:10.030 --> 06:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
Williams I think we've heard
 
06:52:12.110 --> 06:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative cren I haven't heard from
 
06:52:14.708 --> 06:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
her but hopefully we'll have a full
 
06:52:17.070 --> 06:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
house tomorrow for executive session so
 
06:52:19.788 --> 06:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
we'll see everybody then and I hope
 
06:52:21.628 --> 06:52:21.638 align:start position:0%
everybody has a safe ride home it looks
 
06:52:24.310 --> 06:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
like it's snowing again
 
06:52:27.350 --> 06:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
06:52:31.030 --> 06:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative PL uh thank you uh I
 
06:52:32.670 --> 06:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
believe there's going to be an amendment
 
06:52:36.510 --> 06:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 1700 have you an update
 
06:52:39.868 --> 06:52:39.878 align:start position:0%
on that thank I have not uh
 
06:52:42.110 --> 06:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza said that she
 
06:52:44.190 --> 06:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
would be creating an amendment but I
 
06:52:47.110 --> 06:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
have not seen it representative Thomas
 
06:52:49.590 --> 06:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
has created an amendment for that bill
 
06:52:51.750 --> 06:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
so if representative
 
06:52:55.110 --> 06:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
Penza fails to create said Amendment we
 
06:52:58.310 --> 06:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
have one or if the amendment she creates
 
06:53:01.310 --> 06:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
is not acceptable we have one so we'll
 
06:53:05.230 --> 06:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
see you tomorrow thank you you have it
 
06:53:05.240 --> 06:53:08.350 align:start position:0%
see you tomorrow thank you you have it
representative

06:53:08.350 --> 06:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:10.190 --> 06:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
penzes if you
 
06:53:13.190 --> 06:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
could we'll delay a few minutes until we
 
06:53:16.388 --> 06:53:16.398 align:start position:0%
can get a copy of that uh that bill so
 
06:53:17.670 --> 06:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
that we'll at least have a chance to
 
06:53:20.388 --> 06:53:20.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:29.990 --> 06:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:32.910 --> 06:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
okay so the amendment to House Bill
 
06:53:35.670 --> 06:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
1700 that representative Vice chair
 
06:53:39.030 --> 06:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
Thomas has created is
 
06:53:48.468 --> 06:53:48.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:52.190 --> 06:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
F unless it's what person that wrote it
 
06:53:53.388 --> 06:53:53.398 align:start position:0%
that wrot
 
06:53:56.670 --> 06:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
un it's in our committee no it's it's in
 
06:53:58.708 --> 06:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
our committee it's our bill anybody can
 
06:54:01.150 --> 06:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
write an amendment but the only person
 
06:54:03.070 --> 06:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
who can introduce amendment is a member
 
06:54:06.708 --> 06:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
of this committee so you can hand out
 
06:54:09.948 --> 06:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
the amendment to us because our B we're
 
06:54:11.708 --> 06:54:11.718 align:start position:0%
going to be responsible for introducing
 
06:54:11.718 --> 06:54:12.948 align:start position:0%
going to be responsible for introducing
the

06:54:12.948 --> 06:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:54:18.270 --> 06:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:21.150 --> 06:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
won't so there is
 
06:54:24.590 --> 06:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
a hang on hang on there is some
 
06:54:27.230 --> 06:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
speculation that representative penza's
 
06:54:30.670 --> 06:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment repeals RSA
 
06:54:34.468 --> 06:54:34.478 align:start position:0%
12f but also has some language about and
 
06:54:36.750 --> 06:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
representative PL can you Enlighten us
 
06:54:39.910 --> 06:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
what her additional language might
 
06:54:43.868 --> 06:54:43.878 align:start position:0%
be to be honest no I have not seen a
 
06:54:48.310 --> 06:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
draft it is in the works okay I saw some
 
06:54:50.230 --> 06:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
email that indicated she was going to do
 
06:54:52.948 --> 06:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
something with the Air National Guard
 
06:54:57.548 --> 06:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
but um I until we see it we can't
 
06:55:00.350 --> 06:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
imagine what that would be but just in
 
06:55:02.430 --> 06:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
case we have our own Amendment which
 
06:55:06.910 --> 06:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
just strictly repeals 12f RSA 12f which
 
06:55:10.350 --> 06:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
is the weather modification statute and
 
06:55:14.150 --> 06:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh so if re representative penza's
 
06:55:16.948 --> 06:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment isn't suitable we'll have a
 
06:55:19.150 --> 06:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
suitable replacement for
 
06:55:22.750 --> 06:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
it uh representative partiall yes while
 
06:55:23.868 --> 06:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
we're waiting I have a question of the
 
06:55:27.548 --> 06:55:27.558 align:start position:0%
chair if I may um earlier today I found
 
06:55:29.310 --> 06:55:29.320 align:start position:0%
myself in an uncomfortable position of
 
06:55:32.150 --> 06:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
asking one of our testifiers about
 
06:55:35.310 --> 06:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
something that was really not part of
 
06:55:38.628 --> 06:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
their preview um I know we have you have
 
06:55:41.430 --> 06:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
the pink cards in front of you is I
 
06:55:42.868 --> 06:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
can't think of any way to do this but
 
06:55:44.750 --> 06:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you can is there anybody to share
 
06:55:46.230 --> 06:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
who is going to be testifying in the
 
06:55:49.868 --> 06:55:49.878 align:start position:0%
course of a a presentation of a bill so
 
06:55:51.910 --> 06:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
we can gear our questions to be most
 
06:55:56.110 --> 06:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate to um that to the people
 
06:55:58.830 --> 06:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
testifying well that's a good question
 
06:56:02.788 --> 06:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
and a a good thought I'd entertain
 
06:56:04.750 --> 06:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
responses from the rest of the committee
 
06:56:07.190 --> 06:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head I would say that
 
06:56:09.110 --> 06:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
once I get a stack of pink cards I could
 
06:56:12.388 --> 06:56:12.398 align:start position:0%
read them to you to let you know who's
 
06:56:13.788 --> 06:56:13.798 align:start position:0%
planning to
 
06:56:16.270 --> 06:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
testify most of the names would probably
 
06:56:19.430 --> 06:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
be meaningless to you unless it was Mr
 
06:56:24.190 --> 06:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
robarge or um some someone from Dees I
 
06:56:26.548 --> 06:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
could do that but the problem is during
 
06:56:29.430 --> 06:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
the course of a hearing the pink card
 
06:56:32.548 --> 06:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
list the pink card stack
 
06:56:35.948 --> 06:56:35.958 align:start position:0%
grows so I would be hesitant to read the
 
06:56:38.708 --> 06:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
whole stack multiple times throughout
 
06:56:42.030 --> 06:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
the the course of the hearing but um I'm
 
06:56:44.948 --> 06:56:44.958 align:start position:0%
open to other suggestions representative
 
06:56:47.628 --> 06:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas I'm sorry did you uh
 
06:56:49.868 --> 06:56:49.878 align:start position:0%
is a question of of uh not knowing who's
 
06:56:52.708 --> 06:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
coming on deck or just not understanding
 
06:56:54.030 --> 06:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
understanding the name of the person
 
06:56:55.510 --> 06:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
talking at the time well it's it's
 
06:56:57.788 --> 06:56:57.798 align:start position:0%
knowing who's coming on deck and if your
 
06:56:59.510 --> 06:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
question might be better if my question
 
06:57:01.708 --> 06:57:01.718 align:start position:0%
might be better held to address to that
 
06:57:05.830 --> 06:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
person rather than or or if it's a
 
06:57:08.190 --> 06:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
question of uh you know I should have
 
06:57:10.030 --> 06:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
asked to the last person that testified
 
06:57:11.990 --> 06:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
but I thought oh for an example I
 
06:57:14.110 --> 06:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
thought we'd have somebody uh here to
 
06:57:16.510 --> 06:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
testify about phyto blooms in our Lakes
 
06:57:18.830 --> 06:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
today and on one particular Bill and
 
06:57:21.270 --> 06:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
that did not happen and I wanted to get
 
06:57:23.230 --> 06:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
that as part of our
 
06:57:25.708 --> 06:57:25.718 align:start position:0%
um inquiry here today so I end up asking
 
06:57:27.948 --> 06:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
Mr roar's a question that was totally
 
06:57:30.708 --> 06:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
out of his belly Wick and I and I hate
 
06:57:32.910 --> 06:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
doing that I don't know of a good
 
06:57:34.430 --> 06:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
solution though I mean I suppose he
 
06:57:36.150 --> 06:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
could prob me lay him up on the table
 
06:57:37.350 --> 06:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
but then we have to get up and look at
 
06:57:40.388 --> 06:57:40.398 align:start position:0%
them I don't think that work I I I think
 
06:57:42.350 --> 06:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
if if the list is not too long if
 
06:57:43.830 --> 06:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
there's anybody that's here from a
 
06:57:48.110 --> 06:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
department or something um perhaps a
 
06:57:50.510 --> 06:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
mention could be made who's turned in a
 
06:57:52.430 --> 06:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
a pink card but as far as anybody else
 
06:57:54.468 --> 06:57:54.478 align:start position:0%
speaking you could have like like the
 
06:57:56.548 --> 06:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
chair said they they come and they go
 
06:57:58.708 --> 06:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
they have a long list be names would be
 
06:58:01.110 --> 06:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
forgotten by then so so I don't I don't
 
06:58:03.070 --> 06:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
know a real answer to that what if we
 
06:58:05.510 --> 06:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
the SCH we let know who was scheduled to
 
06:58:08.190 --> 06:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
speak before any cards are passed up
 
06:58:10.670 --> 06:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
would that be a that that could be very
 
06:58:12.750 --> 06:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
you know if you get 30 people that could
 
06:58:16.510 --> 06:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
be a long list too I guess well I could
 
06:58:18.868 --> 06:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
announce uh right at the very beginning
 
06:58:21.110 --> 06:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the hearing who I have pink cards
 
06:58:25.070 --> 06:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
from at at that moment as long as you
 
06:58:27.388 --> 06:58:27.398 align:start position:0%
understand that that list could change
 
06:58:29.150 --> 06:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
as the as the hearing weighs on
 
06:58:31.868 --> 06:58:31.878 align:start position:0%
frequently I have people handing in pink
 
06:58:35.670 --> 06:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
cards um when I announce the last pink
 
06:58:38.670 --> 06:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
card then I get a new one you know like
 
06:58:40.868 --> 06:58:40.878 align:start position:0%
today I I said we're going to give the
 
06:58:43.150 --> 06:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
last word to and I forgot who it was
 
06:58:46.270 --> 06:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
soand so and then I get a pink card as
 
06:58:48.310 --> 06:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
soon as that person sits down so they
 
06:58:51.070 --> 06:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
weren't the last one so that can happen
 
06:58:53.788 --> 06:58:53.798 align:start position:0%
but but but I would be willing to
 
06:58:58.190 --> 06:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
attempt to announce who's in the in the
 
06:59:01.430 --> 06:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
initial list of pink cards and if that
 
06:59:04.030 --> 06:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
would be helpful we can try it we can
 
06:59:05.548 --> 06:59:05.558 align:start position:0%
experiment with it ju just think of it
 
06:59:07.948 --> 06:59:07.958 align:start position:0%
as the starting
 
06:59:10.830 --> 06:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
lineup just think of it as the starting
 
06:59:13.510 --> 06:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
lineup the starting lineup that's a
 
06:59:16.270 --> 06:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
that's a good analogy I I I do think
 
06:59:17.750 --> 06:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
though that it's perfectly fine to put
 
06:59:21.030 --> 06:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Roberge on the spot at any point well
