the uh the wrap-up meeting for the
 
00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 align:start position:0%
commission to study Advanced nuclear
 
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
power um and we have a
 
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
very a simple agenda for today's meeting
 
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh approve or modify the
 
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
minutes from our previous meeting on
 
00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
November the
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
6th and then uh we'll discuss the draft
 
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
report uh that everybody has in front of
 
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
them and if we're comfortable signing
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
off or we're going to make additional
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
changes to this so I think those are
 
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
those are our
 
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
options Mr chair i' move in minutes as
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
presented all right uh Senator Pearl
 
00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 align:start position:0%
moves the minutes and they're in so the
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
report contains about 50 pages of
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
content and then an additional 50 or so
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
pages of all the meeting minutes so this
 
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
is a compilation of all of our uh
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
efforts for for the last year um in one
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
package so the minutes from the November
 
00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.029 align:start position:0%
package so the minutes from the November
sixth

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
sixth
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
meeting uh start on
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
page 100
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and go to the rest of the
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
document I'll
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
second I'll second Senator br's motion
 
00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 align:start position:0%
discussion all right all in favor of
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
approving the November six
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
minutes I any
 
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
opposed all right and that is six of us
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
so that's a
 
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.189 align:start position:0%
so that's a
quorum

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.670 align:start position:0%
quorum
all

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
right so this was an ordeal uh the
 
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
subject matter um as we all found out is
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
pretty intense um and and Matt you know
 
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
from working at cab Brook you know just
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
the the conventional nuclear power
 
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
plants are complicated but this kind of
 
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
uh breaks the the mold and uh gets even
 
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
more complicated with all different
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
types of fuels and heat transfer mediums
 
00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
and different sizes of
 
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
designs um
 
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
so this this report is a compilation of
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
all the minutes sort of kind of
 
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
refactored into subject matter area hey
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
welcome Mark sorry that's
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
okay and I think there's one more for
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
you we did nominate you to be the chair
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
going any meetings going forward after
 
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
computer thank you very
 
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
much all right Mark we just took a vote
 
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
on approving the November six minutes I
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
sent those out I think Monday so you
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
should have a copy of those in
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
advance all right and now we're just
 
00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
discussing the final
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
report I'd give the this is my personal
 
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%
opinion having done a lot of it is this
 
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
is probably a a b effort
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
if we had a little more time I think I'd
 
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
make some tweaks to it um I sent this
 
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
out yesterday um which I know is last
 
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
minute for a document to size um but
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
with holidays and I had a trip uh I was
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
traveling this month so I didn't have uh
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
all the free time I hoped I
 
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.469 align:start position:0%
all the free time I hoped I
had

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
um so yeah if you if you've had a chance
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
to look it over a lot of the material
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
was in our interim report so we had the
 
00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
interim report covered meetings up in
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
till June so we had four meetings since
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
then so what I went and did was went
 
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
back through the different sections and
 
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.080 align:start position:0%
sort of updated refreshed them to
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
include more recent information that we
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
received so I guess if you want a few
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
minutes just to look it over and then we
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
can discuss what our next steps
 
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
are and I have one extra copy here if
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
anybody would like to I know Alvin if
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
like to see
 
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
one Mr chair the changes that you made
 
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
in update from the interim report are
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
there's is there a specific section that
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
those are in so we could review those
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so the changes were throughout and
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
keeping track of the changes the
 
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
document just looked like uh got it so I
 
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
I I did not do that but okay if we do
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
make any changes from here on out we
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
will I don't expect them to be
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
major um we will track
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.829 align:start position:0%
major um we will track
changes

00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
if the changes are minor I brought my
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
laptop we
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
can make tweaks as we go
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
but so I'll just I'll walk as you guys
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
are reading it if you don't mind me
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
talking I'll just walk through the
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
sections so we have a cover page table
 
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.230 align:start position:0%
sections so we have a cover page table
of

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
contents and then the beginning of the
 
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
final report there's an overview of the
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
commission it references the
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
commission's uh mandate which is on
 
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
appendix a it lists the members of our
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
commission uh Senator Pearl you replaced
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Ganon after the new term and
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
our member from the New Hampshire um
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau of uh Department of Business and
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs uh he he has since
 
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
resigned from his position that was Mel
 
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
so I did not list him here because he he
 
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't a member for very long um and
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
then I have uh an executive summary of
 
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
and then there's a list of all the
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
meetings beginning with our October 11th
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
meeting from last year and there's just
 
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
a summary of what we went through um the
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
different uh presenters that came and
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
and just a very short outline on what
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
they presented and then each section has
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
a link to the meetings in to the minute
 
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
meetings in the back if people would
 
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
detail and then on page 10 there's an
 
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.150 align:start position:0%
detail and then on page 10 there's an
introduction

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:32.890 align:start position:0%
gives an overview of advanced nuclear
 
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.389 align:start position:0%
gives an overview of advanced nuclear
[Music]

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
technologies and then the importance of
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
nuclear in modern power
 
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
generation existing nuclear power in ISO
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
New England so we have a list of some of
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
the different uh actually there's two
 
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
two current plants in is New England and
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
some that are that have been
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
shuttered and then there's a list of
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
recent nuclear energy projects in the US
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
and there's several there including some
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
14 I I mentioned the new scale and uamps
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
and I gave an update on that they've uh
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
since parted ways uh so a little bit of
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
overview on that was a going to be a a
 
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
first of a Kind project that has gotten
 
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.910 align:start position:0%
first of a Kind project that has gotten
uh

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:23.560 align:start position:0%
shuttered um new scale did
 
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519 align:start position:0%
make an announcement on November the
 
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
20th of this year that they have a new
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
partnership ship with the doe so that
 
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
that and then it discusses the nuclear
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
Enlightenment period that was uh the
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
American nuclear Society had that
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
concept that there used to be a nuclear
 
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
Renaissance and they they classifi this
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
as a nuclear Enlightenment and it's more
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
driven uh
 
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
grid talks about some recent movies uh
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
Oppenheimer and nuclear
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
now in the next section so that's
 
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.550 align:start position:0%
now in the next section so that's
popular

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
culture and then it's it's some
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
information about our regional energy
 
00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:20.839 align:start position:0%
markets how
 
00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:22.590 align:start position:0%
markets how
um

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
broken uh it was yeah well basically
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
what ISO England kind of presented to us
 
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
that the the energy is um coal and oil
 
00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:34.519 align:start position:0%
are diminishing greatly natural gas and
 
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
up then there's a there's a section on
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
technology and then it talks about some
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
of the aspects of it like the modular
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
construction and
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
transportability the fact that nuclear
 
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
has high energy density so there's a
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
graphic here from the Department of
 
00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
energy National that talks about
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
the uranium the size of your the tip of
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
your pinky finger can replace an entire
 
00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:07.959 align:start position:0%
ton of coal so it's very high energy
 
00:13:07.959 --> 00:13:11.030 align:start position:0%
ton of coal so it's very high energy
density

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
medium and it talks about how it's
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
intermittent and then on page
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
18 the ability to load follow so these
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
new designs can ramp up and down to sort
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
and then it talks about the pass of
 
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.269 align:start position:0%
and then it talks about the pass of
Safety

00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
Systems so they they use sort of the
 
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
laws of physics
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
to um shut down safely it's kind of
 
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
different from the older style nuclear
 
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.670 align:start position:0%
different from the older style nuclear
power

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
plants I think we heard in our testimony
 
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
Fukushima had an issue because their
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
generators were below the sea sea
 
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
level and those generators were needed
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
to keep the system in a safe State and
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
so those generators got flooded
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
weren't weren't operational and that's
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
really the main issue that they had so
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
these new designs don't have that that
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and then it talks about
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
small energy planning zon so I think is
 
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
or 10 to 25 mile so a lot of these
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturers talk about an emergency
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
planning zone that's just the footprint
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
of the of the site you know maybe just a
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
half an acre or an
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
acre um and that's still being flushed
 
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
out by the nuclear Regulatory Commission
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
the um that's the desired uh planning
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
about and then it talks about carbon
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
free energy generation that nuclear
 
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
provides potential benefits to New
 
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.069 align:start position:0%
provides potential benefits to New
Hampshire's

00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
 
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
economy we heard about a national
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
security implications from not having a
 
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
robust nuclear program in our country
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
that China and Russia uh may be getting
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
ahead of the US on that and as they
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
develop relationships with the rest of
 
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
the world that sort of cements them as a
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
leader in the nuclear energy industry
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
and that um so we have some catch-up to
 
00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:17.790 align:start position:0%
and that um so we have some catch-up to
do

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
nationally um and there's some National
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
Security risks if we don't do
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
that and then it goes into the different
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear reactor Technologies
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
um it was a little difficult to classify
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
each different design you know perfectly
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
under a subheading because some of them
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
are in multiple categories
 
00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:40.839 align:start position:0%
but so I'm on page
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
21 so we we talked about lightwater SMR
 
00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:46.759 align:start position:0%
so those are more similar to traditional
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
nuclear power plants but smaller in
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
scale 550 to 300
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
megawatts um and then we we listed some
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that are under that
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.269 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that are under that
category

00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
category
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
and then there's high temperature gas
 
00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
reactors uh one in particular that stood
 
00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:06.519 align:start position:0%
out was X
 
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
energy so they have um tof fuel Pebbles
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
they're called but they look like
 
00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
billiard balls so they're sort of like a
 
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
self-contained fuel packet and there's
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of them in a in a bin that kind
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
of circulate like a bubble gum machine
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
and they use hydrogen or sorry helium
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
gas to cool and to extract the heat from
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
the process so that would be a high
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
temperature gas
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
reactor you anybody want to chime in on
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
anything should I keep going
 
00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:48.790 align:start position:0%
anything should I keep going
okay

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
gas um so I have it listed under molten
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
salt reactors on page
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
so and if there are any inaccuracies on
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
this let's let's update it um but my
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
understanding is they're using molten
 
00:17:14.919 --> 00:17:17.189 align:start position:0%
understanding is they're using molten
salt

00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
salt
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
um yeah so it's I don't know if it's
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
that and I can actually I can move it
 
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
document and then we heard from molx uh
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
back in October um and they have an
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
interesting project where they're
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
Brunswick they're building a 600
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
megawatt waste burning reactor and
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to collocate it with an
 
00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799 align:start position:0%
existing nuclear power plant so they're
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to take the waste so we when we
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
went to Seabrook and we we saw that
 
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
building where all the waste is
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
held um moltex is going to you know in a
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
similar Arrangement they're going to
 
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
build a waste recycling plant um and
 
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
then use that waste to power their 600
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
megawatt reactor so they're recycling
 
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
you know slightly used nuclear
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
Fuel and they're going to run for I
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
years so that's on pap age 23 so that
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
was an
 
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.870 align:start position:0%
was an
interesting

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
project and then there's something
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
called a fast Neutron
 
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
reactor and there's a little overview of
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
what that entails on page 24 and uh OKO
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
was classified as a fast Neutron reactor
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
and I think they also do something with
 
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.190 align:start position:0%
and I think they also do something with
uh

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
recycling they're going to
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
Fuel and then we heard from several
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
micro reactor so these are like 1 to 20
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
megawatt plants that they're their
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
Market is uh targeted towards like
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
diesel generators so if you have like a
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
mining operation somewhere off grid that
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
uses a lot of diesel fuel to power their
 
00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
operation these would sort of be like
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
Drop in replacements for large diesel
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
ener uh diesel generators so that's
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
their target not not quite a good fit
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire possibly
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
but um you could you could see
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
maybe something like in the North
 
00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
country or you know it wouldn't require
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
an interconnection so you could put it
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
in the middle of nowhere so we heard
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
reactors on page 26 now U we heard from
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
Ultra safe nuclear they stress a couple
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
of strategic Partnerships with fratone
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
and urano for their fuel supply so
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
there's some links to those companies in
 
00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:07.190 align:start position:0%
there's some links to those companies in
that

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
section and then we heard from
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
Westinghouse Westinghouse is connected
 
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
to the ap1000 project that is that just
 
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
came online in at the Vogal plants so
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
they have a smaller version called the
 
00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:23.799 align:start position:0%
ap300 that's uh designed to not
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
be it's designed to use all the same or
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
all the similar systems that the ap1000
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
in vogle uses but scaled smaller and the
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
idea is that there's not a lot of
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
technological risk because it's they're
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
they're they're not uh innovating in any
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
novel ways they're just kind of scaling
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
down what they already have online so
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
thought that was interesting from wesing
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
house and then it goes into Fusion
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
reactors so that wasn't in the uh the
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
statute that we would cover Fusion but
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
it it's become a recent news item so I
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
thought it'd be good to at least touch
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
on it so there's some explanation about
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
how Fusion is different than
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
fision and we did hear from for one we
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
heard from uh Matt Wald who was a
 
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
journalist that covers nuclear energy he
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
talked about it um we heard uh Michael
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
wiel from the NRC he touched on that the
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
NRC is going to develop regulations for
 
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.110 align:start position:0%
NRC is going to develop regulations for
Fusion

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
Fusion
 
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
reactors we heard from Craig pear see
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
from the American nuclear Society he
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
talked about Fusion reactors the
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
consensus is that it's still decades
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
away um and that the manufa like the
 
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
recent um news about Fusion
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
breakthroughs they're still not reaching
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
a point where they're getting more
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
energy out of the system than they put
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
in um and we heard from zap energy back
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
in September who's working on a fusion
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
reactor and they have a novel way that
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing it they actually use
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
electricity to sort of Slam plasma
 
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
together to create a fusion event and
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
then they capture the neutrons released
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
in liquid metal and then that liquid
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
metal goes to I guess would
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
theoretically go to run a steam turbine
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
energy all right I'll keep going any
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else is this helpful to kind of
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
so then we talk about the nuclear fuel
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
supply chain so Fuel and regulation were
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
two big things that are potential
 
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
hurdles for this Advanced nuclear
 
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
industry so the fuel supply
 
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
chain uh there was this idea that kept
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
coming up called The Chicken and the Egg
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
problem it's sort of like you know which
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
came first or which comes first is it
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
the consumers of advanced nuclear or the
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
producers of advanced Nuclear So the The
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
Producers don't want to create a whole
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
bunch of product that no one's going to
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
buy and the consumers don't want to
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
build their reactors without having fuel
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
to feed the reactor so there like a
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
chicken and an egg problem it's probably
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
going to take the government the federal
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
government to to kind of break that
 
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
deadlock um and one of the uh issues is
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
this Halo fuel production so Halo stands
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
for high essay low enriched
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
uranium so traditional Fuel That C Brook
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
uses I think up to
 
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.909 align:start position:0%
uses I think up to
%

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
%
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
um enriched but the Halo is between five
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
and up to 20% enrich so it's and I think
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
for nuclear proliferation you have to
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
worry about like 90% or higher so it's
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
still not quite um that level of
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
enrichment but this Halo is even more
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
energy dense and a lot of these new
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
reactors um will use
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
it and it allows them to run I think up
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
to eight years without being refueled so
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's uh and CBR I think it's 18 months
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
right so every 18 months you have to
 
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
shut down for maybe four weeks or
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
something you so these new reactors may
 
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
be able to run for much
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
longer um and there's recent news about
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
centrus energy they they've just come
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
online with their pink pipon Ohio plant
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
they've just started processing some
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
that and then on page 30 we get into the
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
Trio fuel technology so Trio takes
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
little poppy seed like um tiny little
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
flakes of uranium and some other
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
materials and they wrap it into a larger
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
either like a rod or a
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
ball and the idea is
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
that um it prevents um radiation uh you
 
00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:53.559 align:start position:0%
know having an event where radiation can
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
leak out it's more it's safer not
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
perfectly safe of course but it's safer
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
um so that Trio fuel technology is used
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
in some of these Advan
 
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:05.799 align:start position:0%
reactors there's a picture of it on page
 
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
30 and then we heard uh continuing with
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
fuel we heard from
 
00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
lightbridge and lightbridge is creating
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
their fuel technology there's a picture
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
of their Twisted rods that has Trio in
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
it um those rods are you know a few feet
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
long it's uh operates at a lower
 
00:25:27.149 --> 00:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
temperature and this may even be an
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
option I think for C Brook right that if
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
you guys uh this may be able to power
 
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
like traditional reactors as
 
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
well it it could be
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:46.039 align:start position:0%
disposal and this idea keeps coming up
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh about recycling slightly used fuel um
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
but there's some questions about whether
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's commercially viable to do that or
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
not but there are some companies looking
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
into doing that
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
and the idea is that the traditional
 
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
reactors they use a very small
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
percentage of the potential energy in
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
the fuel and
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
that um you know it had it all been
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
buried in yucka Mountain miles deep uh
 
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
that in the future there may be ways to
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
like get more energy out of the that
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
uranium um and so there's there's
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
companies working on that it could be up
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
to like a 10 trillion dollar industry if
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
they cracked the nut of uh recycling
 
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.230 align:start position:0%
they cracked the nut of uh recycling
used

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
field and then we get into
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
non-electrical applications so that was
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
mandate and it talks about so if you
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
have a reactor the reactor most reactors
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
want to run 100% of the time just crank
 
00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:47.799 align:start position:0%
out electricity but the rest of the grid
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
has different uh demands like so demand
 
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
goes up and down depending on the time
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
of day or the season and so what do you
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
do with electricity that is being
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
generated but the grid doesn't need it
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
so what do you do with it and uh you
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
know you don't want to just waste it you
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
want to use it for something so so
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
there's ideas of using it for hydrogen
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
production so hydrogen would be a type
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
of stool H sorry type of fuel storage
 
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
technology so you would
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
be hydrogen is more like a battery than
 
00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
it is um a fuel so you would use
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
electrolysis to separate the hydrogen
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
and oxygen atoms and store the hydrogen
 
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
to be used later in combustion or fuel
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
cell or something like that
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
the radio the radioactive materials can
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
produce medical isotopes that are useful
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
for diagnosing and even curing
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
diseases it could be used for
 
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
desalination projects so you could take
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
sea water and make drinking water from
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
it and then there was a lot of talk
 
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
about industrial heat application so a
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
lot of uh manufacturing processes like
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
Metallurgy or
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
um Chris welcome uh I think there's one
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
more we have one
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
that this came off my home printer so it
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
was like two rings of
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
paper so Chris just to catch you up we
 
00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
uh approved the minutes from the
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
November meeting that's page 100 in back
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
and now we're just kind of walking
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
through the I was just kind of Step by
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
Step so we're on page
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
34 or actually 3
 
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
three and we're talking
 
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
about um non-electrical applications for
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy so industrial heat uh so
 
00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
there's U large scale manufacturing um I
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
think some of them are listed here uh
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
the industrial heat can be used for uh
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
different sectors like manufacturing
 
00:28:51.149 --> 00:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
chemical processing food production
 
00:28:51.159 --> 00:28:52.669 align:start position:0%
chemical processing food production
metall

00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
metall
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
orgy it's it's used for things like
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
drying or melting or smelting or
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
refining or cooking or sterilizing so
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
traditionally this has been produced um
 
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:02.909 align:start position:0%
traditionally this has been produced um
this

00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:02.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
large scale heat has been uh produced
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
with fossil
 
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
fuels or coal natural gas and oil so
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
some of these designs have uh
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
application for industrial heat so it
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
would decarbonize these processes and it
 
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519 align:start position:0%
gets into that a little bit it talks
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and then this is
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh on page 34 it gets into Data Centers
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
and we even heard about Bitcoin mining
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's uh you guys probably know that's
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
a favorite subject of mine so I it's
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
Chairman's prerogative to uh connect
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
those two things together um but not
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
just um turning energy
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
into uh like a digital commodity that's
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
one application for it but these AI data
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
centers like we're all familiar with how
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
AI is kind of growing they they're very
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
energy hungry so a lot of these AI um
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
you've heard of cloud CL Computing with
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
like Google and Microsoft and Amazon
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
those very large data centers require so
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
a computer needs energy to function
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
right so if you have a lot of computers
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot of energy and uh a lot of
 
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
these data centers they want to be
 
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
carbon neutral so they're exploring
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
using nuclear energy to power their data
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
centers um and that was confirmed I had
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
a conversation with the founder of Nano
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh technology uh and he told me that a
 
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
lot of these guys are calling him up and
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
asking um
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
and will turn your mic on sorry there's
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of AC involved there too right
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
cooling you got to make sure that those
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
server Farms are kept at at a proper
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
temperature there's a lot of energy draw
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
there not just for the processors
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
themselves right yeah that's that's more
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
of a question than a statement I that is
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
I mean from my understanding I I I agree
 
00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:52.039 align:start position:0%
with it um and there's ways you can air
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
cool it or you can liquid cool it right
 
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
um and I think there's even talk of
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
using like extracting the heat through
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
some kind of liquid and then running
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
like a greenhouse with it so like
 
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
reusing it for a different purpose a lot
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
of those like 350 megawatts of load
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
continuous load is what I'm hearing for
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
some of those data centers that's a lot
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
l so I I mean I think that's uh we're
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
only going to have more and more
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
computers running and they all require
 
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
energy so give an idea that's about 17th
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
of new hampsh PE 17 yeah sounds crazy
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
rough that's just one data center yes
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
amazing so think about what we would
 
00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
have to do here to add a data center
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
right right yeah with our high Electric
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
market all of the nuclear capacity in
 
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire yeah it's one point
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
1.2 1.2 gws yeah
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
all right and then it gets into some
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
risks of of nuclear technology so we
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about financial risks to
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
these projects um so it go it goes into
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
the ways it a project can go
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
wrong and then it talks about safety
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
considerations um for the reactors
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
themselves and there's a lot of concern
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
about you know what do you do with the
 
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.430 align:start position:0%
about you know what do you do with the
radioactive

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
radioactive
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
waste uh you know how long is the
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
halflife of this
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
waste there's a little there's a section
 
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:27.629 align:start position:0%
waste there's a little there's a section
on

00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
understanding radiation so I thought it
 
00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:34.039 align:start position:0%
was interesting to just touch on um you
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
know radiation the different types of it
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we get some radiation
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
exposure if we fly in an airplane or but
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of discussion about how
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
radiation can be very
 
00:32:49.629 --> 00:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
harmful and that's something that the
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
public is very aware
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
of and then it talks about nuclear waste
 
00:32:55.159 --> 00:32:56.029 align:start position:0%
of and then it talks about nuclear waste
waste

00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
waste
 
00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:57.830 align:start position:0%
waste
management

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
so 34 states utilize dry Cask facilities
 
00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
and we saw those at um at seab
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
Brook so it's a common convention to
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
store the the waste on
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
site and we saw that some of these
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
designs incorporate that into their
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
design um where they
 
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
actually they actually store the casks
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
as part of their design and then after
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
maybe 40 or 50 years they have a plan to
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
sort of reprocess it but that's kind of
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
like an ongoing not reprocess but store
 
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.909 align:start position:0%
like an ongoing not reprocess but store
it

00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere um but I think uh the whole
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
concept of intermediate sto storage
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere is uh politically not feasible
 
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.149 align:start position:0%
somewhere is uh politically not feasible
currently

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.159 --> 00:33:48.269 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
yeah nobody wants it
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
yeah I was on uh I I heard a uh not
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
related to this uh
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
not related to our meetings but there
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
was a a conference it's it's in one of
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
our meeting notes the reference to it I
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
think from the October meeting but there
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
was a conference uh about uh recycling
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
nuclear Fuel and they were saying that
 
00:34:14.829 --> 00:34:14.839 align:start position:0%
because it's consent-based that they
 
00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:16.599 align:start position:0%
need one Governor somewhere in the
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
country to consent to receiving the
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
waste so that they can set up a
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
recycling uh plant for it so apparently
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
not one Governor has done that so
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
but that it could be potentially be a
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
industry all right and then it talks
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
about um comparing the risks of nuclear
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
37 so I actually have a question about
 
00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.430 align:start position:0%
37 so I actually have a question about
that

00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's is that a terot is that
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
what tww stands for yeah so how many
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
terawatts of power do wind versus and
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
solo do produce versus nuclear because I
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
mean I see there essentially the same
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
risk factor yeah only creating one
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
terawatt in wind and a thousand in
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
nuclear would could really be a
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
different scale that's a good question
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
it is kind of levelized towards how much
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
they how many ter terawatts they
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
generate so without knowing the
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
difference between them it would kind of
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.589 align:start position:0%
 
risk

00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
per right but you could have one death
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
in solar and 100 in nuclear and still
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
have the same per 100 because you don't
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
know how many terawatts in each are
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
produced that's a good question is that
 
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
something we should add to the report I
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
don't know just that was me reading it
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the way my mind work I mean
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we could come up with another
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
that and now I'll just keep going here
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
considerations so there's this new Part
 
00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
53 that the NRC is working on that would
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
cover these Advanced nuclear
 
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.190 align:start position:0%
cover these Advanced nuclear
reactors

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
reactors
 
00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
um the NRC presentation they're they
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
seem very enthusiastic about moving this
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
along but uh the bureaucratic uh inertia
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
is sort of holding it back
 
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.990 align:start position:0%
is sort of holding it back
right

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
and then on page 39 we had uh
 
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
presentations from different Federal uh
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
program so we had a presentation from
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
Chris Los of the gain program and gain
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
stance for Gateway for
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
Accelerated Gateway for Accel
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
accelerated innovation in
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear and so he presented on the uh
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
the voucher system that's part of the
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
gain program so that could be um they
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
have vouchers valued up to
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
$500,000 with a 20% cost share and
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
there's different details in that
 
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
section but that could be a resource for
 
00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.109 align:start position:0%
section but that could be a resource for
our

00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
state and then we heard from Julie
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
karaki from the doe loan programs office
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
and her presentation was pretty uh dense
 
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.630 align:start position:0%
and her presentation was pretty uh dense
with

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
information so I'll just pause here on
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
on the top of page 40 she talked about
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
the cost ranges
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
I went back through all of our old
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
minutes and I wasn't able to get like a
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
consistent uh you know chart of all the
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
different uh cost estimates from the
 
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.670 align:start position:0%
different uh cost estimates from the
different

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.109 align:start position:0%
different
manufacturers

00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
and I sent out a survey this might may
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
be an addendum to our report at some
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
point but see if I can pull it up
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
here I've only gotten four
 
00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:59.589 align:start position:0%
here I've only gotten four
responses

00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't know why it's not
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
it could
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
someone push the button on the remote
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
there we
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
sleep that's my screen yeah I just
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to show you I I sent out a survey
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
to the different manufacturers I've
 
00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:42.790 align:start position:0%
to the different manufacturers I've
received

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.109 align:start position:0%
received
some

00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
here yeah sure yeah welcome if this is
 
00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
just be a
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
minute and actually it probably won't be
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
so everybody see that so this is a
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
survey we're still compiling results so
 
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
i' I got another response today it looks
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
like so I have five responses
 
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
um this is not in the report because
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
it's not uh we didn't get responses in
 
00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:34.839 align:start position:0%
time and there's some I still have to
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
track down but basically you know who
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
they are what stage is their is their
 
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
current design is it less than 50
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 60 around 90 fully
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
complete um how do you
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate uh how long do you anticipate
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
it will take to to commence construction
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
after the design phases complete and
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
there's different date ranges do you
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
have plans to build a pilot plant for
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
your projects demonstration project how
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
do how do pilot plants contribute to the
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
success of scaling up to a commercial
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
unit significantly moderate minimal that
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
kind of responses if if applicable have
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
you secured a site or partners for the
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
demonstration project yes uh and then
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
there's various uh yes maybe no with
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
thing engagement with the nuclear Reg
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
tour commission how would you describe
 
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
your interaction with the NRC in
 
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
preparing for following a license
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
application highly interactive
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
moderately interactive limited
 
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
interaction we have not yet
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
interacted what type of feedback or
 
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
questions have you received from the NRC
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
about your design detailed general
 
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
questions about safety and regulations
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
we have not received feedback or
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
questions and then uh when do you expect
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
to have your first non-nuclear con
 
00:40:58.829 --> 00:40:58.839 align:start position:0%
construction permit from the NC when do
 
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
you expect to have your first nuclear
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
construction permit approved by the
 
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
NC how suitable is their design to New
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um these are just it aligns
 
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
forth range in dollars so there's the
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
question that I asked range in dollars
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
per megawatt
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
hour and then any additional information
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
so just briefly here I'll I'll click on
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
the responses I'll go to that
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
question so we
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
have so we can compile this as sort of
 
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
like an addendum if we get complete
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
information um but I did want to look
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
at the range here in megawatt hours so
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
I've only gotten two
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
responses and they range between 80 and
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
120 and then one response is $200 per
 
00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.109 align:start position:0%
120 and then one response is $200 per
megawatt

00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
megawatt
 
00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
hour so I couldn't tell you W without
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
digging into it who who those responses
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
came from
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
but so going back to page 40 the top of
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
the page there um Julie karaki gave us
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
an approximate cost range so in $23 she
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
says 66 to$ 109 doar per megawatt hour
 
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
and then she says by
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
2050 they expect that to go down to 58
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
to $79 per
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
meat so this response here the 80 to 120
 
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
is a little bit more in line with what
 
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
Julie said but a little
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
higher so that we talked about this at
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
our last meeting um that's the best
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
response I could give you
 
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
but but Julie's
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh presentation had a lot of that
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
information in it so we capture it here
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
40 and they expect approximately they
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
need approximately 200 gws of new
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
nuclear generation if the us is going to
 
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
transition away from
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
carbon so that's a a pretty big number
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
Generation and then we heard from Dr
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
Billy valderama from the
 
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
Department from the office of nuclear
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
energy from the
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
doe and he he kind of uh affirms some of
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
the other things that were said
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
prior and I'm looking at the bottom of
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
page 40
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
here um he also referenced
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
the new scale power module at uh in
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
Idaho in his presentation and I added a
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
little caveat there at the very end
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
happening and then on page 41 he talks
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
about this Marvel project uh it's 100
 
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
kilowatt micro reactor it's going to be
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
deployed at the Idaho National
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
Laboratory by the end of 2024 and I
 
00:43:59.790 --> 00:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
page uh let's see page 13 there was a
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
project and then he talks about the four
 
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
main priorities of the office of nuclear
 
00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
of nuclear energy so they want to
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
maintain the existing reactor Fleet they
 
00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
want to deploy new Advanced reactors
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
they want to ensure secure nuclear fuel
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
supply chain and they want to expand
 
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.790 align:start position:0%
supply chain and they want to expand
International

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
cooperation and he mentioned the
 
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear State collab
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative and I put a note to myself
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
that there should I should have expanded
 
00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
that uh some detail on that
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
but um that would be an interesting
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
pursue and then the next section this is
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same as our interim
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
report uh the recent federal policy
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
initiatives so it talks
 
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
about some different Federal uh
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
legislation that is related to Advanced
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
Nuclear So we have the nuclear energy
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
Innovation and modernization
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
act and that was signed into law by
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
President Trump in
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
2019 we have the infrastructure
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
investment and jobs Act of 2021 that had
 
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.150 align:start position:0%
investment and jobs Act of 2021 that had
some

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh it had some Provisions for nuclear
 
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.790 align:start position:0%
uh it had some Provisions for nuclear
energy

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
energy within its
 
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
total uh 2.5 billion is earmarked for
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
Technologies and I'll we're on page 42
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
now um the inflation reduction Act of
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
2022 had some aspects that applied to
 
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.309 align:start position:0%
2022 had some aspects that applied to
Advanced

00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
Advanced
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear and then the chips and science
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
Act of 2022 also
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
um had some provision Visions for
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
Nuclear So it authorize $390 million to
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
establish up to four new research
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
reactors and nuclear science and
 
00:46:06.839 --> 00:46:09.950 align:start position:0%
reactors and nuclear science and
engineering

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
facilities then we have the
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
2023 and then we have the Strategic
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
nuclear infrastructure
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
act I don't know that one was signed
 
00:46:26.559 --> 00:46:32.390 align:start position:0%
act I don't know that one was signed
into

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
law and then continuing we had a recoup
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
American nuclear Global Leadership
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
act and then accelerating deployment of
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
versatile Advanced nuclear for clean
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
energy the advance act that was a
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisan group of
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
2023 it passed the US Senate as part of
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
2023 and then we have uh some topic
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
about there's organized opposition uh to
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
to nuclear that is longstanding in our
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
area and we have
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh a representative from Beyond
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
nuclear here is that right you work for
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
Beyond nuclear okay you're just you're
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
friends with Paul g g okay that's that's
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
I just made the assumption
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so it talks about I'm sorry go
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
ahead that your
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
friends okay all right it's also one of
 
00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:35.349 align:start position:0%
friends okay all right it's also one of
my

00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
constituents oh excellent oh very good
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
actually I have two constituents with
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
constituents all right so it talks a
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
little bit about the clamshell Alliance
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
that we uh have heard so much about they
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
were formed in 1976 and they opposed the
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
construction of C Brook nuclear power
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
plant um there was an event where large
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
a large protest with civil
 
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
disobedience and I think something like
 
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
1400 activists were arrested is that
 
00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.390 align:start position:0%
1400 activists were arrested is that
sound

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
right 15 okay 145 more importantly
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
they oh yeah you had to go through
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
the um and then they were ultimately
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful in stopping Seabrook
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
totally but there there was only one um
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
reactor developed I think partly because
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
of financial reasons but some because of
 
00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.510 align:start position:0%
of financial reasons but some because of
opposition

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
right and then there's the C10 research
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
and Education Foundation that's funded
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
mainly by um Massachusetts if I
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
understand correctly the C10 they
 
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
operate radiological monitoring Network
 
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.950 align:start position:0%
operate radiological monitoring Network
around

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
cook so they they get activated if
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
something goes wrong right C
 
00:48:59.549 --> 00:48:59.559 align:start position:0%
Brook okay all right I won't put you on
 
00:48:59.559 --> 00:49:00.270 align:start position:0%
Brook okay all right I won't put you on
the

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
spot and then it talks about Beyond
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
nuclear which we've had Paul Gunter from
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
Beyond nuclear has participated in many
 
00:49:08.349 --> 00:49:08.359 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
meetings um and they're out at tol Park
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
Maryland and so they're looking
 
00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.030 align:start position:0%
Maryland and so they're looking
to

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
um if I understand it and you correct me
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong they want renewable energy
 
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
and they don't want nuclear right is
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
that kind of the yeah so they're kind of
 
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say anti-nuclear but
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
they would rather nuclear not
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
proceed okay all right so anti- nuclear
 
00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
would be accurate um but they focus on
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
policy and advocacy so they're active in
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
our state as
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
well all right and then we move on to
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
there needs to be if this is going to
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
proceed further public engagement is
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
important and you know how do we do that
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
how do we engage publicly in this area
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
and there's a few ideas in in those
 
00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.670 align:start position:0%
and there's a few ideas in in those
paragraphs

00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
paragraphs
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
there and then just I probably have
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
another 10 minutes and then I'll I'll be
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
wrapped up um sorry to put you to
 
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
sleep we heard from ISO New England um
 
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
they put on a presentation to us and it
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
was uh Eric Johnson presented to us on
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
October he talked a lot about the
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
changing Energy Mix in the region um it
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
sounds like a lot of the our surrounding
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
states our neighbor states are pushing a
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
lot of green energy policy on ice and
 
00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
New England they're neutral they don't
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
take a position um but they do follow
 
00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
what states tell them to do um and so if
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a different idea we
 
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
have to be a little more assertive with
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
Isa New England uh to kind of
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
counterbalance what our neighboring
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
states are doing you know if our
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
policies are different and they seem to
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
be I think uh I think I heard our
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate on TV call us the uh
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
the redheaded stepchild of I or
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
something because our state thinks
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
differently than other states don't
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
quote me on that but he said something
 
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
like that um but so Eric Johnson went
 
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
into uh you know how our energy grid is
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
transitioning the challenges of
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
renewable because it's uh renewable just
 
00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
tends to be intermittent and it you know
 
00:51:19.789 --> 00:51:19.799 align:start position:0%
in the winter time we can't have the
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
power go out because people might freeze
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
to death and uh that would
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
be not a good situation so he talks
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
about you know the need for base load
 
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
power he says he talked about the
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
interconnection cue he gave us kind of
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
like a an overview of how
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
interconnection uh how the new ones come
 
00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
online and he said that there's about
 
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:45.640 align:start position:0%
38,000 megawatts of predominantly
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
renewable energy working its way through
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
that interconnection que process that's
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
Regional so that was an
 
00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:56.829 align:start position:0%
Regional so that was an
interesting

00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:02.799 align:start position:0%
see so their assumption ice New
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
England's assumption is that no new
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
nuclear plants will be constructed in
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
the region over the next 40 years so
 
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
that's their assumption that they're
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
operating on so if if this Advanced
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear industry gets off the ground
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
that assumption would need to change
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
right so um so it was kind of good to
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
connect with icea New England on this
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
topic and then we have I mentioned our
 
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate we had Donald Cree he
 
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
presented back in our May
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
meeting he reminded us uh he said people
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
think that he's anti-nuclear but that's
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
not the case and early in his career he
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
was involved with the Vermont Yankee
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
plant he was I think def he was
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
defending the plant against aggressive
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
actions by the state of Vermont and he
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
said he thought that was wrong that the
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
state told the plant that it had to shut
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
down so that was
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
interesting but he said in his position
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
neutral well and that our state in
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
general is technology neutral
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
um he said adding it adding nuclear to
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
ADV to renewable standards could be an
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
option um but he said
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
his his role as consumer advocate he has
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
to consider who Bears the cost of any
 
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
potential new nuclear generation so he's
 
00:53:28.829 --> 00:53:28.839 align:start position:0%
very uh he he guards the rate pair from
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
having additional burdens and risks put
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
on them so that would rule out any kind
 
00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
of large scale subsidies by the state uh
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know he would be likely opposed to
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
that all right so the last couple
 
00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.789 align:start position:0%
that all right so the last couple
sections

00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
findings I think we going to slow down a
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
little bit just because I think these
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
deserve a little extra attention the key
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
findings and then the potential State
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
policy options so let's uh it's only a
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
page and a half but let's go through one
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
at a time and see if we want to cross
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
off anything or expand
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
anything um because I think this will be
 
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
the section that people kind of flip
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
to and then after that we just have the
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
conclusion which is basically a summary
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
of everything we just talked about
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
so you want to take a minute just to
 
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
read those let's start with the summary
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
of key findings and just put your
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
thinking caps on and see if there's
 
00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.789 align:start position:0%
thinking caps on and see if there's
anything

00:54:28.789 --> 00:54:28.799 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:54:28.799 --> 00:54:36.910 align:start position:0%
anything
missing

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
um read first yeah do you want me to
 
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.910 align:start position:0%
um read first yeah do you want me to
read

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
read
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
it um you want to read it you want me to
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
read it out loud or do you want to just
 
00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.470 align:start position:0%
read it out loud or do you want to just
read

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
read
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
it however you want to do it
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
yeah oh well let's go through them one
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
at a time then you want to read them
 
00:54:54.799 --> 00:54:55.630 align:start position:0%
at a time then you want to read them
sure

00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:12.430 align:start position:0%
 
guess

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.829 --> 00:55:14.839 align:start position:0%
okay signant
 
00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:23.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
it's yeah
 
00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:27.559 align:start position:0%
achieving that
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
zero without nuclear okay so that came
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
from one of our presentations they were
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
talking about I think it was Julie
 
00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
kazaros presentation she was saying like
 
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
if nuclear is not part of the mix then
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
the costs just go through the roof but
 
00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
you're right it approaches
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
impossibility so you want to make that
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
statement a little stronger I I would
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
just question the feasibility of
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
something like that point out that it's
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
about you could just simply add limiting
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
use could significantly escalate the
 
00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:07.039 align:start position:0%
cost of carbon
 
00:56:11.029 --> 00:56:11.039 align:start position:0%
reduction efforts and feasibility with
 
00:56:11.039 --> 00:56:12.510 align:start position:0%
reduction efforts and feasibility with
current

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
Technologies and feasibility with
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
limiting its use canly escalate the cost
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
of carbon reduction
 
00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
efforts potentially making it infeasible
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:37.870 align:start position:0%
 
right's

00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
okay I'm G to just write this in my
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
it all right then number
 
00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
two uh nuclear energ reliability and
 
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.309 align:start position:0%
two uh nuclear energ reliability and
efficiency

00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
iner reliability and efficiency of power
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
add so you mentioned earlier about you
 
00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:25.430 align:start position:0%
add so you mentioned earlier about you
know

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
new reactor technology has the ability
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
to load follow right well generally what
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
we have in this country can't load
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
follow right C can't load follow it's a
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
Basel plant they fire up it runs that's
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
I mean unless I'm wrong I know you have
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
can I you can move a little bit but yeah
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
I think cook probably could load follow
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
I think economically it's not viable the
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
way that they sell okay it could put
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
like additional stresses on the whole
 
00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
system right if you change the love the
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
fuel fuel could you put your mic
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
on I believe that the fuel is what gets
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
stretched if you you try to load follow
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's an issue with the
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
fuel it's purely I think it's purely
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
economics I understand because
 
00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:09.559 align:start position:0%
everything is designed around months so
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
they put a certain of fuel so you know
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
there are challenges up and down I think
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
it could be done technically technically
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's okay did you want to make a change
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
to number
 
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
two well given that I don't know maybe
 
00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.950 align:start position:0%
two well given that I don't know maybe
not

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:33.640 align:start position:0%
um so it talks about grid stability that
 
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the main point there is
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
that right
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
yeah that's an important feature that we
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
yep okay with number two number three
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
progress in nuclear fuel recycling the
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
development and implementation of spent
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
nuclear fuel recycling methods are
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
important important steps forward in
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
management so I have notes to myself
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
after I read it
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
again talking like adding something
 
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:11.559 align:start position:0%
about economic
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
viability and and
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh avoiding proliferation
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
risk so I think adding those two things
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
to that one would round it out works is
 
00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
right all right uh number four
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
Innovation and nuclear business models
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
the emergence of innovative business
 
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
models for advanced nuclear technologies
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
is a notable Trend such as the power as
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
model so several of these manufacturers
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
talked about they would continue to own
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
the plant and they would uh basically
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
sell the power to customers so they
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for any maintenance
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
and ultimate decommissioning of it it
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
seems very uh
 
01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
ambitious but that's what several of
 
01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.430 align:start position:0%
ambitious but that's what several of
them

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
said understand need to change
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
it it's good to go
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay number five modernizing nuclear
 
01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.470 align:start position:0%
okay number five modernizing nuclear
licensing

01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
processes efforts are underwear to
 
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
update and streamline the nuclear
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
reactor licensing process focusing on
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
achieving a balance between flexibility
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
should we say something in there about
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
still ensuring safety and all of that
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
that the Regulatory Commission pointed
 
01:00:38.589 --> 01:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
out yeah while while
 
01:00:38.599 --> 01:00:42.309 align:start position:0%
out yeah while while
ensuring

01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:44.839 align:start position:0%
safety I yeah I agree with that that's
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
really the nrc's main job right to maybe
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
focusing on achieving a balance between
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
flexibility safety and predictability or
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
something like that just to keep it
 
01:00:56.109 --> 01:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
simple can you balance three things yeah
 
01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:57.549 align:start position:0%
simple can you balance three things yeah
that's

01:00:57.549 --> 01:00:57.559 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
problem all right I'll add safety in
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
there between flexibility and
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
predictability uh number six learnings
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
from Advanced nuclear projects key
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
lessons include the importance of
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
complete design development before
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
construction collaboration with
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
experienced contractors and ensuring a
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
robust supply
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
chain so we had uh was it wesing house
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
they talked a lot about Lessons Learned
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
From the Vogal plant because that went
 
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
way over budget and uh it was eventually
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
successful but in economic terms it was
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know big big cost overruns and so
 
01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.150 align:start position:0%
uh you know big big cost overruns and so
they

01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
said a little bit I mean if you if if
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
you average it out over 80 years maybe
 
01:01:46.589 --> 01:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
it's not so much but yeah over the life
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
of the plant that's going to be a it's
 
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
going to be valuable but from a net
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
pressent value basis yeah yeah but they
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about their um some of
 
01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
their Partners in that project were not
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
as uh experienced as they maybe could
 
01:02:00.079 --> 01:02:01.910 align:start position:0%
as uh experienced as they maybe could
have

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
been and that's the
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
whole it's kind of a separate chicken
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
and an egg thing is
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
that you need a lot of uh High skilled
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
labor to build these projects they're
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
not being built for decades and so how
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
do you kind of start up that whole
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
experience you know cycle I don't know
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is where you'd want to put it but
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
then they talk about if you're the first
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the of its kind and You' make first
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
of a kind of 20 different projects
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
you're not going to save money but you
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
have to find one that and go with it
 
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I don't know if this is
 
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
where you want it but or if you talked
 
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
about that somewhere else would you put
 
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
that there so like achieving nth of a
 
01:02:45.309 --> 01:02:45.319 align:start position:0%
kind I think is the term they would use
 
01:02:45.319 --> 01:02:50.470 align:start position:0%
kind I think is the term they would use
right

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so you get uh efficiencies
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
economies of scale if you're like if
 
01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
you've ever put together an Ikea
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
bookshelf or done something first of a
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
kind in your house you know you like the
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
first time takes
 
01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
you five hours and you do it wrong but
 
01:03:08.109 --> 01:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
the second time you do it you can do it
 
01:03:09.309 --> 01:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
right I think that might fit under
 
01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.190 align:start position:0%
right I think that might fit under
number

01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
for okay yeah actually let's put it
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.279 --> 01:03:27.349 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
um seven Advanced reactors combining
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
novel Technologies Innovative reactor
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
designs are being developed combin high
 
01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:35.240 align:start position:0%

01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
safety good yeah I mean it's it's a
 
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
generic statement y eight uh goal for
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
cost trist with fossil fuels there was
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
an industrywide goal to make adance
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactors cost competitive with
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel power plants without relying
 
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.309 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel power plants without relying
on

01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
subsidies so we heard that from several
 
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
manufact I'm sure they'd all love
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
subsidies if they could get them but we
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
sort of said that we're not friendly to
 
01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:09.799 align:start position:0%
subsidies so I think some of them may
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
have tored their presentation to us you
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
know um so that last part of without
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
relying on
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
subsidies I think that that reflects at
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
least several of the presentations that
 
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.190 align:start position:0%
least several of the presentations that
we

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
heard everybody good with that
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
one uh number nine Target for commercial
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
deployment by
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
2030 uh many in the industry claim
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh aim to achieve commercial
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
deployment of advanced reactor
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
Technologies by 2030 or earlier I think
 
01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
that reflects the camera plant right I
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
think they're that's one I think they're
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
2028 I know the coal plant's going to
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
25 let's
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.109 align:start position:0%
25 let's
see

01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
2030 I think is a good that's Terra
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
power that's on page
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
2025 it doesn't have a date for when
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
they're coming online I think 2030
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
reflects a lot of what we've heard most
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:05:20.029 --> 01:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
right we we've heard some say late 2020s
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
but we know how these dates tend to slip
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
all right uh number 10 emphasis on high
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
efficiency electricity generation
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
Advanced reactors are being designed to
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.559 --> 01:05:42.510 align:start position:0%
 
efficiency

01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
so yeah what do we mean is that like
 
01:05:47.549 --> 01:05:47.559 align:start position:0%
heat is that a heat rate thing is that
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
like a getting more
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
energy out of the fuel than potentially
 
01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
some of the older plants do and mattt I
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to expand on that
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
but yeah so like like the gas plants
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
that run at a higher temperature can get
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
more fuel out or more energy out um I my
 
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
personal opinion is it might dilute kind
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the rest of the findings that my
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation you take it out I agree
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
take it out all right
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
yeah could it be changed to say the
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
modular and smaller reactors allow for
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
localized energy generation which will
 
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
improve efficiency a lot of it's lost in
 
01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
the lines right it's but it's not about
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
the line I don't think getting at it's
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
not about transmission line losses here
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's about efficiency of the reactor the
 
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
or the in a case of a gas plant the
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
thermal right extracting is more energy
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
out of the fuel than the energy loss in
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
right right
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
exactly so should we cross it I would I
 
01:06:54.269 --> 01:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
would in my opinion I would would get
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
rid of it because you're you're opening
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
up discussions to like I said about heat
 
01:06:59.470 --> 01:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
rates right like the most efficient
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
natural gas plants are like 60%
 
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
efficient okay huh yeah so
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
right the G turbine all right so I'm
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna scratch number
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
10 yeah
 
01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.870 align:start position:0%
10 yeah
yeah

01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
right want to go to 11 11 okay sorry
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
yeah good awesome um 11 strategic
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
approaches to reactor velopment
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
strategic development approach
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
prioritizing rapid learning and
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
industry again very generic yeah I think
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
that works and number 12 commitment to
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
commercializing Advanced nuclear is a
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
broad commitment to the
 
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
commercialization of advanced nuclear
 
01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
technology signaling a potential
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
sector and the only thing I would say do
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
we want to add like partnering with you
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
know large energy consumers because we
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
know you know like you talked about with
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
the data centers they're looking that is
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
something they're actively looking into
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
you know large industrial consumers
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
looking at Advanced reactor
 
01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
technology or do you think that's
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
already covered I think that might be
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
its own what if we replace number 10
 
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
with that thought where large data
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
centers are looking I would like large
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
industrial uses or heavy or high load or
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know however you want
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
to phrase it but big energy consumers
 
01:08:34.749 --> 01:08:34.759 align:start position:0%
are looking at Advanced nuclear because
 
01:08:38.349 --> 01:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
like a lot of them want to be carbon
 
01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:40.070 align:start position:0%
like a lot of them want to be carbon
neutral

01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay like the the new
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
core you know new scale mou is an
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
example of that I don't know where
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:54.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.110 align:start position:0%
yeah
all

01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
right would you want to include broad
 
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
bipartisan commitment because it seems
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
like both sides are pushing legislation
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
that is assisting in this or is that not
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
what your point was in inv it makes it
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
political at that
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
point are we could add something about
 
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
that back in the section that talks
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
about uh the different legislation yeah
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
um because I I'll go through and see who
 
01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
the sponsors are but I'm pretty sure
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
there's example I mean the inflation
 
01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
reduction Act was yeah pretty much the
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration but it was by
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
Parson I could put is that a right
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
there if it's not there already let me
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
here so are you referring in 12 to
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
between the the reactor producers and
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
energy users would you plan to
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
get yeah that's a good
 
01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.390 align:start position:0%
get yeah that's a good
point

01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
um hey Keith yeah on 12 maybe change it
 
01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
from broad commitment to Broad
 
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
interest okay because I'm not sure that
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
there actually has been any Financial
 
01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
commitments made
 
01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:18.750 align:start position:0%
commitments made
okay

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
of was page 41 recent federal policy
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
initiatives I'll just I'll add the word
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
bipartison in there is that all right
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
and I I'll find a good spot
 
01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
blow and what I'll do is
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
is I'll track changes on the word
 
01:10:59.229 --> 01:10:59.239 align:start position:0%
document I'll update based on what we
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
discussed here I'll circulate the track
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
changes so you can see exactly what's
 
01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
different um and then we'll release it
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
r and if you have Mark if you have
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
suggested language you know we'll throw
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
that in there
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
right so last I heard was will change
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
commitment to interest on number 12 yeah
 
01:11:23.199 --> 01:11:24.669 align:start position:0%
commitment to interest on number 12 yeah
okay

01:11:24.669 --> 01:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
I I had a couple other items that just
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
for General consideration so one would
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
be um we had a lot of talk of
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
deregulated versus regulated markets and
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
how most likely any new nuclear is going
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
to be in a regulated market at least at
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
the beginning is that worth including in
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
this section um it's you know it's in
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
one of
 
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
section so it's covered in the consumer
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
Advocates section um
 
01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:54.870 align:start position:0%
Advocates section um
and

01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
then in the most
 
01:11:57.199 --> 01:11:59.310 align:start position:0%
then in the most
recent

01:11:59.310 --> 01:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
recent
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I want to say it was mol's
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
presentation not molx um Ultra safe
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
nuclear they
 
01:12:12.669 --> 01:12:12.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned trying to figure out where it
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
is in the
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
document they mentioned that um I'll
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
have to search for it he mentioned that
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
most likely it'll be in a vertically
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
Market first right yeah that's I'm just
 
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if you're saying okay well the
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
customer for this report if you said
 
01:12:31.629 --> 01:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
okay what do I want them to take away
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things is you know most
 
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
likely you're not going to get a new
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
nuclear plant in a deregulated Market by
 
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
the 23ds you're going to be much later
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to be nth of a Kind versus
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
first of a kind once there's more
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
certainty and you know utilities
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
like

01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean unless it's privately funded
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
right yeah I mean
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
um if if I understand David like if we
 
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
had approval for a micro reactor say
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
let's say let's say it's commercially
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
available you could put one on your
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
industrial site somewhere in New
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as long as it was approved by
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
like there's
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
no it would just be a funding an issue
 
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
soting there's no prohibition I think
 
01:13:30.629 --> 01:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
what I don't want to speak what you're
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
asking is there's no prohibition on an
 
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
industrial consumer entering into a PPA
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
with a
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
generator right so I mean that's a
 
01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
possibility but it's kind
 
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
of low probability
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
right all right do you want to we'll put
 
01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.669 align:start position:0%
right all right do you want to we'll put
something

01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
about the likelihood of first of a Kind
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
going into a regulated market
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
as opposed
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
to yeah I don't feel super strongly
 
01:13:59.470 --> 01:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
about it so if the rest of the
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
commission doesn't think of arms there
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
I'm it just seemed to me that it might
 
01:14:03.199 --> 01:14:03.910 align:start position:0%
I'm it just seemed to me that it might
be

01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
relevant we had a few people make that
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
point um you're seeing it with almost
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
everything right now right so I think
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's fair I offshore wind utility
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
skill solar none of those are getting
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
built on Market Revenue they're all
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
getting built in you know
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
PPA you know State States supped
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
contracts okay so I think that's a fair
 
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
statement to make all right I'll I'll
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
draft something up when I can sit and
 
01:14:37.629 --> 01:14:37.639 align:start position:0%
think about it and then but it'll it'll
 
01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
I'll go back through and see what uh
 
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
different comments were made I think
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington couldn't be
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
here today he he has some thoughts on
 
01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.990 align:start position:0%
here today he he has some thoughts on
that

01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
so um and he he's brought up that point
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
a few times I'll go back and look
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what he said
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
all right any other items and the key
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
findings we'll update
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
those all right so last um or before we
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
get to the
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
conclusion um we'll look at potential
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
State policy
 
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
options Mark do you want to read through
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
those yeah I'll keep going okay um an
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
act legislation for clean nuclear energy
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh designate nuclear as a clean
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
technology under renewable portfolio
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
standards and other state clean energy
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
programs aligning with New Hampshire
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
Department of energy 2021 State energy
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
strategy on page
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
56 there's a link in the document that
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
goes to their energy strategy if you
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
want I can pull up what they
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
said these aren't necessarily
 
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations from us right Keith
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
these are just we're just throwing out
 
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
options you know some options that right
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
policy makers could take a look at
 
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
exactly right I mean that's really all
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
we can do anyway right we're not making
 
01:15:51.149 --> 01:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
any solid recommendations okay this is
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
our preferred Apple
 
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh well let's go through the whole list
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
and see I don't think
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's we're kind of limited in what we
 
01:16:02.669 --> 01:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
can do um and actually there's a few
 
01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation that match up to a
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.390 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
right uh two feasibility studies for
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
advanced reactor sites conduct studies
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
to identify suitable sites for advaned
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
reactors focusing on potential
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
applications and end users like
 
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
industrial facilities or retiring coal
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
plants yeah so the the feasibility
 
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
studies could be done by maybe the
 
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
department of energy or we talked about
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth is potentially going to look
 
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
at some of these things
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you have any thoughts
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:58.990 align:start position:0%
 
recommendation

01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
my concern would be get you're getting
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
utilities involved with you know load
 
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
capabilities and what they might need to
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
do to upgrade their systems is that
 
01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:09.750 align:start position:0%
do to upgrade their systems is that
going

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
to be costly to them time consuming to
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
them or do you think it can be done
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
without involving each I guess that's my
 
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
question do you think that something
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
like this could be done without
 
01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.070 align:start position:0%
like this could be done without
involving

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
involving
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
utilities you know or feasibility
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
studies and that sort of thing so that's
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
kind of something that would have to
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
probably be approved by the Pu so some
 
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
of these Federal programs like retiring
 
01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:37.159 align:start position:0%
coal plants we have one coal plant in
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
our in our state um they're looking
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
for um that specific situation and
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
they're will nuclear right they're will
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
the coold nuclear transition they're
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
willing to help out with that so we'd
 
01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
have to investigate to see exactly what
 
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
resources are available but that may be
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
one one
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
me is that all right okay Financial
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
incentives for nuclear projects identify
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
potential federal financial support
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
through grants loans and tax credits
 
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
facilitate Advance reactor
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrations of deployments while
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
being mindful of potential political
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
resistance IND
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
the so this is uh the free Federal Money
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
Tree you know like
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
um I guess it's it's it's something that
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
we could pursue
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
potentially I know we're we're stingy
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
except for when the federal government's
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
going to give us
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
to well policy could be um you know
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
Department's pursuing it right the
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
executive branch could pursue it seems
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
like that's a good question actually I
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
mean it seems like they would be doing
 
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
isn't that more of a private sector ini
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
state could be through like a state
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
State University or something like that
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
if it was like the gain program
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
specifically used for research so if it
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
was like dth or un or something like I
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't I'm out of my my depth of
 
01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge but I I think potentially it
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
could be yeah I mean
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
that like like similar to you it sounds
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
good what you're
 
01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
saying do we want to modify what we're
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
saying in that instead of identify then
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
it maybe utilize potential federal
 
01:19:45.149 --> 01:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
financial support
 
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't
 
01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
know identifying would be the first step
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
yeah to go find
 
01:19:58.590 --> 01:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
right that's the effort to find
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
right like drill down in that one area I
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem with keeping it
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
but I understand what Center Pearl's
 
01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.270 align:start position:0%
but I understand what Center Pearl's
getting

01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
at maybe you could combine that with
 
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.430 align:start position:0%
at maybe you could combine that with
number

01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.470 align:start position:0%
 
s

01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
s
 
01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.990 align:start position:0%
s
coordin

01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
coordin
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
so number seven when we get to it that
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
has been in state statute for that's
 
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
right decades and I I had um
 
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
um someone someone uh in the governor's
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
office looked into it for me and it
 
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't been filled since like 2007 the
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
position and the person that was in it
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
last passed away so we can't even talk
 
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
to them they've never yeah so I don't
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
know if David seen my my bill yet
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
um you're not allowed to say it hasn't
 
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
been released yet but there's a bill to
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
sort of like update that section and and
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
put it under the department of energy
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
which think would be a good home for it
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
um and it would so the coordinator was
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to inform the governor and the
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
executive counsel like twice a year for
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
going back to the 50s I think and that
 
01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done so I think if I recall
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
correctly I put in like a fiveyear cycle
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
where it would be you
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
know sure
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
sure you're
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
right so then my my other so when I when
 
01:21:26.669 --> 01:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
I present Bill I'm going to say if you
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to do this then repeal the
 
01:21:29.199 --> 01:21:30.310 align:start position:0%
don't want to do this then repeal the
statute

01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
because nothing uh bothers me more than
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
statutes that aren't followed it like so
 
01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
anyway it's it's a discussion I'm sure
 
01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have but that's number seven
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
to so you were saying combine those two
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
well if you're going to have you know a
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
development coordinator one of the
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
duties be to seek out find available
 
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
potential grants
 
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
there kind of be a task of this more
 
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
Poli

01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
so I'd have to go look at what the
 
01:22:18.669 --> 01:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
statute actually
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
says um I mean I'm okay you can this
 
01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
just do you want to put it can I move it
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
after that one so if I move three to
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
like number
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
eight and then kind of refer back to the
 
01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.070 align:start position:0%
eight and then kind of refer back to the
previous

01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
combine I I don't Keith I'm okay yeah
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to think like thinking
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:54.990 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
I guess I kind of want to keep it but I
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm okay it's sort of like a I don't
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
have any harsh you hard objection to it
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
or anything it's question we had the
 
01:23:06.669 --> 01:23:06.679 align:start position:0%
conversation okay but I'll move it till
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
after seven and that way it's sort of
 
01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll reorder connect connect them
 
01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
all because they do they do seem
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
related I just kind of see that as like
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
if this is going to happen that's going
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
like uh number four Workforce
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
Development and public awareness
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
Implement Workforce training programs
 
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
public awareness campaigns Foster Talent
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
pipelines and increase public
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of nuclear
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
technology you would probably have the
 
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639 align:start position:0%
biggest on this one yeah I think you
 
01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
know in industrywide whether it's
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
utilities or the nuclear Regulatory
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
Commission there there's a talent
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
shortage out there for people with
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
engineering degrees or backgrounds in
 
01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
this and because most of the plants were
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
built in the 70s and 80s a lot of the
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
workforce that work for 30 plus years or
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
retiring so it's it's definitely
 
01:23:57.790 --> 01:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
something that if this industry is going
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
to grow there's there's a shortage
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
attempt for
 
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
yeah do do you see there being issues
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
down the road with just
 
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
having the labor to support the plan
 
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
itself operationally don't or is that
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
not something you're concerned about
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
right now no I would say like the like
 
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
like craft workers like electricians
 
01:24:21.629 --> 01:24:21.639 align:start position:0%
mechanics and stuff we have those people
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's more you know engineers and you
 
01:24:25.629 --> 01:24:25.639 align:start position:0%
know people that work in the control
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
room typically have engineering degrees
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
where they come out of a nuclear
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
Navy yeah the industry is uh struggling
 
01:24:32.239 --> 01:24:35.149 align:start position:0%
Navy yeah the industry is uh struggling
to

01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
one number five streamline licensing and
 
01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:43.910 align:start position:0%
one number five streamline licensing and
permitting

01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
processes simplify and expedite Advanced
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
reactors licensing and permitting
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
processes reducing regulatory
 
01:24:54.270 --> 01:24:54.280 align:start position:0%
delays is the state policy or is that
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
state the like the state has its own
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
um atomic energy statutes right they're
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
sort of they're tied to the federal
 
01:25:16.270 --> 01:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
statutes so I don't know David do you
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on is
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
that from a licensing perspective that's
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
a federal thing I think right I mean the
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
state's not going to license a facility
 
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
does it or does it I don't think it
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
licenses a facility but there is there
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
is like you know the Department of
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services or there's other
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
stuff that the state does interface with
 
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
sighting that' be more permitting right
 
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
not licensing per se or you think
 
01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:51.270 align:start position:0%
not licensing per se or you think
there's

01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.280 --> 01:26:21.189 align:start position:0%
 
overlap

01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
hey David would you mind just turning
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
your mic on and just repeating what you
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
what you said just because it's being
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
streamed that's all so
 
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
I I would have to go back and check but
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
I do think I would have to go through
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
the sighting process with the site
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and that process is
 
01:26:48.189 --> 01:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
streamlined so some of these
 
01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations came from our
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
discussions but
 
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
it while you looking I'll just say this
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't see any problem with number
 
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
five whether we really have a lot of
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
State Licensing control or if it's more
 
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
permanent I don't think the statement is
 
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
wrong I think it's fine we want line
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
whatever involvement we
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
have ums For Me Maybe it's not in my
 
01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
copy do you guys have one that talks
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
something the Nei what I'm trying to
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
find the Nei there it is number
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
nine can I see that a
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
isn't mine is from an old toner
 
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
cartridge you guys I got the got the
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
new so the Nei has a whole list of
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations for policy and some of
 
01:28:02.109 --> 01:28:02.119 align:start position:0%
these came from those
 
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
suggestions and there's a link in the
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
digital copy that goes to their document
 
01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
it has a whole bunch of different
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations that that's that's what
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
I wanted to just point out that that
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.990 align:start position:0%
 
recommendations

01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
number six invest in nuclear supply
 
01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:26.189 align:start position:0%
number six invest in nuclear supply
chain

01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
chain
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
capabilities promote public and private
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
investments in the nuclear supply chain
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturing so we probably want to
 
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
scratch out public or and then maybe a
 
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
different word besides
 
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
promote encourage
 
01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
encourage I mean the governor does
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
ribbon cuttings all the time right like
 
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
there's promotion of Private Industry by
 
01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.430 align:start position:0%
there's promotion of Private Industry by
state

01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
um so you want to say
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
encourage take out the word
 
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
public okay public sorry so number six
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
Investments encourage private
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
investments in the supply chains
 
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
inment yeah I don't know we're going to
 
01:29:24.189 --> 01:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
make any public investment as a state
 
01:29:27.109 --> 01:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
into it I would agree with it yeah so I
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
mean public could be the federal
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
government and we know that this is a
 
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:31.709 align:start position:0%
government and we know that this is a
national

01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
national
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
security you know you know there's
 
01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
National Security implications for
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
building up the but it's not a state
 
01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.590 align:start position:0%
building up the but it's not a state
policy

01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
right I guess there'd be no issue with
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
leaving public and in that case we can
 
01:29:45.149 --> 01:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
encourage it with a resolution or
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
something if we change can encourage it
 
01:29:49.629 --> 01:29:49.639 align:start position:0%
if you change to promote encourage
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
whatever I could add the word Federal in
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
a I mean it goes back to Federal
 
01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
incentives right if there's Federal
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
incentives to you know expand rail or
 
01:30:04.109 --> 01:30:04.119 align:start position:0%
port or you know whatever for
 
01:30:04.119 --> 01:30:06.229 align:start position:0%
port or you know whatever for
manufacturing

01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
facility the state depart not got to say
 
01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
no to no again we got to remember these
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
are just
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
options it's an option that we can
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
encourage it so I I
 
01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
don't we're not me you know we're not
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
saying the state should do this we're
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
just saying the state could look out for
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities to do it
 
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
right all right how however you want to
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
word that's okay with okay number seven
 
01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
appoint a state nuclear development
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
coordinator revive the coordinate of
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
atomic development activities position
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
from a 1955 State Statute to advise and
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
manage pronuclear policies and
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
initiatives guiding the legislature
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
government yeah I I could pull up that
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
statute if you guys want um
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
I mean it's one of the few things that
 
01:30:59.109 --> 01:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
we sort of uncovered in
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
our it's it's long been forgotten about
 
01:31:03.229 --> 01:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
I I
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
believe the fact that it's in our
 
01:31:05.239 --> 01:31:06.950 align:start position:0%
believe the fact that it's in our
statutes

01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
have

01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
is a coordination of studies I think
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
I the governor and Council shall appoint
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
the head of one of the state departments
 
01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
concerned as advisor to the governor
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
with respect to Atomic Industrial
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
Development within the state as
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
coordinator of the development and
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
Regulatory activities of the state
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
government relating to the industrial
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
commercial uses of atomic
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
energy as a deputy of the governor in
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
matters relating to atomic energy
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
including participation in the
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
activities of any committee formed by
 
01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
the New England
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
states to represent their interest in
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
such matters and also cooperation with
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
other states and with the government of
 
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
the United States the department head so
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
appointed shall have the additional
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
title of coordinator of atomic
 
01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.790 align:start position:0%
title of coordinator of atomic
development

01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
activities and there's a few
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
UH responsibilities there
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
so that's what that's related to and if
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
um I think it's just good to have a
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
discussion about it right it's in
 
01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
statutes let's uh updated or eliminate
 
01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.550 align:start position:0%
statutes let's uh updated or eliminate
right

01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
that all
 
01:32:43.229 --> 01:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
right number eight legislation to update
 
01:32:45.109 --> 01:32:45.119 align:start position:0%
atomic energy statutes draft and
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation to update the
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
state's atonic energy statutes
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
incorporating the federal definition of
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
advanced okay so I have a bill submitted
 
01:32:55.709 --> 01:32:55.719 align:start position:0%
I think you're a co-sponsor on it um am
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
I so we heard from one of
 
01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
the it could have been Nei I think it
 
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
was Nei they they suggested that there's
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
a federal definition of advanced
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
nuclear I don't know if I could pull it
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
up I'll tip my fingers but it has a
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
whole list of advanced
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
nuclear and to tie our state statutes to
 
01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.030 align:start position:0%
nuclear and to tie our state statutes to
that

01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
definition putting it in our state
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
statute so that there's an anchor point
 
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
so for like any future legislation it's
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's part of the part of our statutes so
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
in that update there's a a minor refresh
 
01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
to our
 
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
statutes uh and that's included in that
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
bill hasn't been released yet but number
 
01:33:39.629 --> 01:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
nine consult State policy Suggestions by
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
Nei uh nuclear energy Institute or Nei
 
01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
compiles reports on potential State
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
policy options for States as support
 
01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.830 align:start position:0%
policy options for States as support
nuclear

01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
nuclear
 
01:33:50.669 --> 01:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
energy yeah so just real quick there's a
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
link in the document that goes to
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:33:59.390 --> 01:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
um you know we hear legislators talking
 
01:34:02.189 --> 01:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
about promoting nuclear and this would
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
be a good place for them to look in this
 
01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:10.790 align:start position:0%
be a good place for them to look in this
document

01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
here I don't know how to make it full
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
screen but it talks about policy options
 
01:34:18.430 --> 01:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
and again they're they're not
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
all so State climate and reduction
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
policy State energy
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
policy energy planning
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay Capital
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
markets transmission
 
01:34:36.189 --> 01:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so it's a nine-page
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
document um that's fairly
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
recent this points people to that
 
01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.990 align:start position:0%
recent this points people to that
document

01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
perfect uh number 10 reevaluate New
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's participation in the NRC
 
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
agreement State program the NRC assist
 
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
States in establishing programs to
 
01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
assume regulatory Authority Under the
 
01:34:58.270 --> 01:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
atomic energy Act of 1954 allowing
 
01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
states to license and regulate various
 
01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
materials this assistance includes
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
reviewing requests for agreements
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
conducting training and evaluation and
 
01:35:08.189 --> 01:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
coordinating event according with
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
agreement states currently 39 states
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
have such agreements including the
 
01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
Aire so re-evaluate
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there's much
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
discussion about this in the department
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
of energy or in the Pu I mean does this
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
here so this goes to the nrc's website
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
they have a page about New
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's a link in the
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
electronic document that goes to this
 
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
about so so
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
augustinus an is that currently a person
 
01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
in the department of he's the
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
administrator of radiological health
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
health section Department Public
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
Health I can't read it from here is that
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
public health let's see if I can make is
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
that public health is that what you're
 
01:36:09.639 --> 01:36:10.510 align:start position:0%
that public health is that what you're
talking

01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
about yeah this is the information on
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
there it is yeah it's Department of
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
Public Health at the health
 
01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:20.310 align:start position:0%
Public Health at the health
services

01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
correct and here's a link to our this is
 
01:36:33.629 --> 01:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
the agreement that our state has signed
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
NRC so the idea is maybe we need to go
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
back and you know ref familiarize
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves with this
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
um is that a good idea okay and you know
 
01:36:50.109 --> 01:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
maybe um there's resources through those
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh number 11 urge the NRC to review and
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
approve licenses State Legislature could
 
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
pass resolutions urging the nuclear
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission to not delay
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
license approvals for advanced nuclear
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
projects so this would be you know just
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
one of those uh house resolutions that
 
01:37:12.669 --> 01:37:12.679 align:start position:0%
go into the circular file somewhere in
 
01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
DC but it could uh you know raise
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
awareness about
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh number 12 urge Isa New England to
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
seek Advanced nuclear
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
proposals while Isa New England remains
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
neutral on energy generation it does
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
take direction from Member State policy
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
cubes so this was Dick Barry's
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
suggestion he he you know di dick I
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
served on the science technology and
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
energy committee when he was the
 
01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and he's very knowledgeable
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
about the stuff he his thought was why
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
don't we tell all of New England to uh
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
to pursue pursue this stuff and I don't
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
know if we can do that or not but I mean
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
you could put it in here but there's
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism for them to like
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
push one technology really over another
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
they approve tariffs
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
and manage markets I mean
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
that's so our neighboring states are
 
01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
pushing carbon you know Net Zero policy
 
01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:21.629 align:start position:0%
pushing carbon you know Net Zero policy
right

01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
and we're sort of getting muscled around
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
by those other markets um I guess if we
 
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
said Net Zero has to include nuclear
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear and put that into the
 
01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
conversation regionally is that is there
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
a way to do that see what I mean aren't
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
the other states pushing it through
 
01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
subsidies to the to the solar and wind
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
which makes their economics on ice on
 
01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
New England look better so probably
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
through that mechanism not necessarily
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
through the polic itself I mean that's
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
how they're that's how they're doing it
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's what I said earlier it's that
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
none of
 
01:38:58.750 --> 01:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
those none of the wind farms that have
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
been built in Maine even the ones in New
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are relying on ppas you know
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
and all the offshore wind
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
contracts I think between two developers
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
they just paid $100 million do in
 
01:39:12.149 --> 01:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
penalties to get out of the
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
agreements because finan is not working
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
all out of Market you know as far as
 
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
what's getting developed right now on a
 
01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.950 align:start position:0%
what's getting developed right now on a
large

01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:39:28.109 --> 01:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
scale okay anybody I mean if
 
01:39:30.589 --> 01:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
anybody sees anything
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
differently that's all I
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
see this I'll add I think I I agree I
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
think um I think the overarching
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
encouragement I New England could still
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
happen we could write letters and we
 
01:39:46.589 --> 01:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
could we could encourage them to um to
 
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
consider the New Hampshire position
 
01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
which is different I think than the
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
other states uh but I also agree that
 
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's a PPA somebody has to
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
pay for the technology so both things
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
are true okay would you modify that or
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate it that number 11 or 12 I'm
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah I mean I I'd keep it I mean I
 
01:40:08.109 --> 01:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
think encouraging ISO New England is
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
different than getting a result from ISO
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
New England so letting them know what
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
our state policy is and the direction
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
we're going they want to please us and
 
01:40:18.589 --> 01:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
so they'll be um interested in our
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
position but um it's also true that they
 
01:40:26.109 --> 01:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
they uh they respond to ppas and and and
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's how they do business okay
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
so I think both things are true I I
 
01:40:31.149 --> 01:40:31.159 align:start position:0%
would I would leave it in there you
 
01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
leave it in okay and any caveats I mean
 
01:40:38.350 --> 01:40:38.360 align:start position:0%
I put they they're neutral and they take
 
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
direction from Member State
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
policy that's true it's true yeah yeah
 
01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean there may be ways to
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
assert if our policy direction is
 
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
different than our surrounding states if
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
we just a little more assertive with it
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
um just to make sure that our interests
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
are I think that's
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
right last one number 13 declare nuclear
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
energy in the
 
01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:07.159 align:start position:0%
state's national interest State legisl
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
pass resolutions nuclear energy to be in
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
the state and
 
01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
National again another resolution but I
 
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
don't know El you guys are the
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislators so if you want to go for it
 
01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:19.719 align:start position:0%
you there's two resolution items in
 
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
there do you have any thoughts on those
 
01:41:25.589 --> 01:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
13 13 and what was the other
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
one 11 11 and 13 are kind of related
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
other well we certainly can if that's
 
01:41:41.589 --> 01:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
what we decide
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
that we can certainly uh create
 
01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:46.719 align:start position:0%
resolutions if that we decide that's the
 
01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
interest of the state and what we want
 
01:41:50.109 --> 01:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
to put forward so I I don't disagree
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
with either state
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
okay and if we're signaling that we're
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
friendly to the these businesses I think
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
that's an important Market signal um if
 
01:42:01.470 --> 01:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature makes such a statement
 
01:42:02.669 --> 01:42:02.679 align:start position:0%
that would be important for ISO New
 
01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
England to know so it all kind of
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
connects to to each other yeah but
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's an important Market signal to
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
send I think yeah I guess it depends on
 
01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
who you're sending the resolution to you
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
know really yeah well I guess it would
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
be to the federal government right I
 
01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.430 align:start position:0%
be to the federal government right I
mean

01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah I mean from a site
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee model here in New
 
01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have uh nothing in front of
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
us we are viewed I think as a state
 
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
that's not friendly to uh to power
 
01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
generation of any kind and so if that's
 
01:42:38.589 --> 01:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
important to the legislature to send a
 
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
message to the market that we are open
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
for business then uh then those kinds of
 
01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
messages are important
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay it does have some effect as you're
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
saying it does next time we vote on a
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
resolution we
 
01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
yeah people are watching closer than
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah um oh that uh I don't know if I
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned this but on
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
Monday uh so uh representative Michael
 
01:43:08.189 --> 01:43:08.199 align:start position:0%
Vose is the chair of the current chair
 
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
of science technology energy and he let
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
me know about a program that's run by
 
01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.109 align:start position:0%
me know about a program that's run by
the

01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
national National I want to say Council
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
but it's not Council conference National
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
Conference of state
 
01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
legislators n CSL next week they're
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
running uh a uh a program on state
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
nuclear policy so so I'm going to go
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
down to North Carolina on Monday and
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're gonna talk to other state I have
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
no idea what to expect but we're
 
01:43:39.589 --> 01:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
actually going to take a tour of a plant
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
down there um so I'll report back to the
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
group you know what what I find out next
 
01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.109 align:start position:0%
group you know what what I find out next
week

01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
but and we'll send some signals that
 
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
all right so this is a good uh point to
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
ask is there anything missing from these
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations and I'll open it up to
 
01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
our audience members here our
 
01:44:07.709 --> 01:44:07.719 align:start position:0%
our um our guests in the in the room um
 
01:44:09.189 --> 01:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
if you've had a chance just to look at
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
those 13 items and if there's anything
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:15.119 --> 01:44:19.589 align:start position:0%
 
missing

01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.599 --> 01:44:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
right there's always going to be
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
something that was
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
overlooked all right any anything uh
 
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
else you'd like to add to that the only
 
01:44:32.229 --> 01:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is you
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
know I've had the opportunity to be like
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
all over the country over the past year
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the debates is being
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
had in it was it had we had the debate
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
at nud you know
 
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
is our markets you know our Market's
 
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
broken right now when it comes to
 
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
electricity and you know as I spoke to
 
01:44:54.589 --> 01:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
earlier nothing's getting developed
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
based on Market revenue for the most
 
01:44:57.870 --> 01:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
part in New England right they're all
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
out of Market contracts whether you're
 
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
agree or disagree it doesn't matter
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the facts
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
um so is that that that conversation is
 
01:45:11.149 --> 01:45:11.159 align:start position:0%
being had does that bode well for
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
nuclear or not like
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
so the more you have out of Market
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
contracts the more you supress wholesale
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
market prices right and distorts the
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
market reduce you guys know all about
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
this so you know what's the what's the
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
future look like and we probably can't
 
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
get too involved in that but I just
 
01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise it it's it is an issue
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
and it is one that again we haven't
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
developed a nuclear reactor in a
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
deregulated uh jurisdiction ever so if
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
it does it have to be because if we're
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to just move forward with all
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
bilateral PPA you know
 
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
contracts I don't know I'm throwing
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
stuff out there but I mean it's so how
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
would you how would you put that into I
 
01:46:01.149 --> 01:46:01.159 align:start position:0%
don't know you know it's it's just I
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's just a kind of a
 
01:46:04.109 --> 01:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
sidebar you know there's there's a
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
discussion about you know our markets
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
deliver High signals that you know
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
properly incentivize you know level play
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
and that's the question that's that's
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
out there right now and there's and it's
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
not and it's not partisan you know it's
 
01:46:22.830 --> 01:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
there's folks that have long supported
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
markets that are realizing that maybe
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
they are broken and we need to kind of
 
01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
look at something else so I don't know I
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
really know how to put it in into words
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to raise it with a group
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
and see if that's something that you
 
01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
know it's probably a whole separate
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
discussion but it does impact
 
01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
nule I think I would just say the
 
01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:44.199 align:start position:0%
legislature has lots of options
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
available to them there's unel today is
 
01:46:49.629 --> 01:46:49.639 align:start position:0%
building a 5 megawatt solar farm you
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
know and so you could say oh it's okay
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
to build a 250 megawatt nuclear reactor
 
01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
I mean the legislature has options
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
available to it right now they've capped
 
01:47:02.669 --> 01:47:02.679 align:start position:0%
it at you've capped it at five megawatts
 
01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing that says you
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't change that that's a good you
 
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
know and maybe that's a maybe that's a
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
pro possible policy recommendation to
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
look at that's going to open a whole can
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
of worms up just just so you know yeah
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
it is possible it's in your purview to
 
01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.229 align:start position:0%
it is possible it's in your purview to
change

01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
you could put the genie back in the auto
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
if you wanted so this you mean the like
 
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
re-regulate the market
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
and you could I mean there serious
 
01:47:33.149 --> 01:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
discussions being had about it but once
 
01:47:35.149 --> 01:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
you cross that five megawatt threshold
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't you get into issues with with f
 
01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.430 align:start position:0%
don't you get into issues with with f
and

01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:40.589 --> 01:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
Federal I'm sure there would be a a host
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
of issues to work but
 
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately anything is anything is
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
possible that's what I would say I mean
 
01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
I know that five MW number seems to be a
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
a threshold or or barrier when we're
 
01:47:59.950 --> 01:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
talking about um net metering and things
 
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
like that we see once we rub up against
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
that we sort of get out of the perview
 
01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:04.950 align:start position:0%
that we sort of get out of the perview
of

01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
States that's a jurisdictional issue on
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
compensation right so but if you were
 
01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:15.679 align:start position:0%
to what the chairman is talking about is
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
is a rate base issue which you know
 
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
generally Falls to St
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
approv I think yeah I'm not aware of any
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
federal um limit Mr shock may may know
 
01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
may want to comment but it's U so far I
 
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware I understand um Senator
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
Pearl what you're talking about with
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
respect in that metering I'm just not
 
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
sure from a sighting perspective there
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
would be any jurisdictional boundary
 
01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
that that I know of Mr shock would you
 
01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
have any
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
okay David sorry just put your mic on
 
01:49:04.270 --> 01:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you don't mind I know it's a
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
pain yeah we get us once you get outside
 
01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:09.719 align:start position:0%
of the realm of net metering and instate
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
compensation regimes yeah that it's not
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
the five megawatt limit is not quite as
 
01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:19.109 align:start position:0%
the five megawatt limit is not quite as
important

01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:24.470 align:start position:0%
important
okay

01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
so so like let's say let's say that they
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
passed a law you know allowing for
 
01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
utilities to build up to 10 megawatts
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
right let's say uni to to 10 megawatt so
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
so that's not subject to F jurisdiction
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
it because it's rate based I mean I know
 
01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:52.550 align:start position:0%
it because it's rate based I mean I know
right

01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
the I don't feel so bad
 
01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
now I don't think it's a problem for the
 
01:50:01.629 --> 01:50:01.639 align:start position:0%
utility right right it's
 
01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
um the the problem with net metering and
 
01:50:09.550 --> 01:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
that sort of compensation scheme right
 
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
um has to do whether it's with whether
 
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's wholesale transaction that touches
 
01:50:18.030 --> 01:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
the grid the the
 
01:50:21.629 --> 01:50:21.639 align:start position:0%
grid so it sounds like there's another
 
01:50:25.629 --> 01:50:25.639 align:start position:0%
suggestion here I I would need help
 
01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
putting it together is there a statute
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
that we could reference that we could
 
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
talk about modifying yeah perhaps Mr
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
shiik and I could collaborate on on
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
something that would be
 
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
unified right so it's the RSA 374
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
restructuring of the the industry
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
statute okay um that essentially
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
required utilities to divest of their
 
01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
asset assets the nuclear assets went
 
01:50:57.310 --> 01:50:57.320 align:start position:0%
first um and you know they are otherwise
 
01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
prohibited from investing and owning uh
 
01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:02.350 align:start position:0%
prohibited from investing and owning uh
those

01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:51:05.229 --> 01:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
assets right unless they fall under this
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
distributed generation exception where
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
they can build up to five megawatts
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah so you could in theory call
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
distributed generation 250 megawatt and
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
so I mean would you target just for
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear would
 
01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:21.069 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear would
you

01:51:21.069 --> 01:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
I would um I'm careful not to make
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations other than to say what's
 
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
possible and and I Mr so of course the
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
big issue with this is who's responsible
 
01:51:32.669 --> 01:51:32.679 align:start position:0%
for payment yeah right and it's rate
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
payers and the last time one of our
 
01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
utilities constructed a nuclear plant it
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
went bankrupt and rate payers were
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
required to pay for those the those
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
excess costs for years but if we keep it
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
small right like mro reactor size right
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
up to 20 megawatts or something then the
 
01:51:55.390 --> 01:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
risk is low risk that's right just like
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
the solar farms at 5 megawatts the risk
 
01:51:59.390 --> 01:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
is pretty low and that's what you're
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
seeing now is the development of these
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
smaller solar arrays that are that are
 
01:52:06.669 --> 01:52:06.679 align:start position:0%
utility owned so you you know you've
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
kind of implemented that model on a
 
01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
smaller scale already could fall into
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
the non non Alternatives too right yeah
 
01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
that's true so would you guys mind
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
collaborating on that and uh pull me in
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
as needed and
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
we we is that all right I mean it sounds
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
like something uh concrete that I'm
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
grasping at concrete things here you
 
01:52:30.189 --> 01:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
know resol one we'll talk afterwards and
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
get you get you something okay all right
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we can do that all right so I'll
 
01:52:37.229 --> 01:52:37.239 align:start position:0%
put a 14
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
here all right so we're almost done it's
 
01:52:43.390 --> 01:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
um would you mind indulging me in
 
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
reading the conclusion because that's
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
another thing I think with happy to you
 
01:52:54.030 --> 01:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and then we'll be done uh all right
 
01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
conclusion in conclusion a Hampshire May
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
stand at a critical juncture in its
 
01:52:59.470 --> 01:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
energy policy having the potential to
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
become a net exporter of electricity to
 
01:53:02.430 --> 01:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
the rest of New England throughout
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
strategic decision making the foundation
 
01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
of this transformation May lie in
 
01:53:07.790 --> 01:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
adopting Advanced nuclear energy
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
technologies that promise to bring
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
reliable and cost competitive
 
01:53:12.750 --> 01:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
electricity generation to commercial
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
realization within the next decade the
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
analysis conducted by the study
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
commission reveals significant process
 
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
in nuclear energy particular Ally in
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
developing Advanced reactor Technologies
 
01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
these new designs offer enhanced
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
efficiency and safety making nuclear
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
power more viable and attractive for
 
01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
large scale energy production by
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
focusing on these Innovative
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
Technologies New Hampshire can establish
 
01:53:34.990 --> 01:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
itself as a leader in the advanced
 
01:53:37.629 --> 01:53:37.639 align:start position:0%
nuclear sector positioning excuse me
 
01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
positioning itself as a major
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
electricity supplier in the regional
 
01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
market Central to this vision is the
 
01:53:46.270 --> 01:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
emphasis on cost competitiveness
 
01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear reactors promis to
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
improve operational efficiencies and
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
reduce life cycle costs which could be a
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
potential opportunity for New Hampshire
 
01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
to produce electricity at a lower cost
 
01:53:57.629 --> 01:53:57.639 align:start position:0%
than traditional fossil fuel based
 
01:54:00.030 --> 01:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
sources if this economic Advantage is
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
realized it could allow our state to
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
become a net electricity exporter
 
01:54:06.069 --> 01:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
enabling the sale of clean and firm
 
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
Excess power at competitive prices to
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
neighboring states moreover focusing on
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear energy would align with
 
01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
broader energy reliability goals nuclear
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
power plants can provide consistent and
 
01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted electricity a critical
 
01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:21.719 align:start position:0%
factor in ensuring a stable and
 
01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
dependable energy supply for New
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the broader New England
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
region especially during the harsh
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
Winters we experience
 
01:54:31.950 --> 01:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
here while the aspect of global warming
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
is a significant consideration in the
 
01:54:35.790 --> 01:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
shift towards nuclear energy the focus
 
01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
of this conclusion is predominantly on
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
the economic and reliability benefits of
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
this energy source New Hampshire's
 
01:54:43.229 --> 01:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
adoption of advanced nuclear
 
01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
technologies would be a step towards a
 
01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
more sustainable energy future and a
 
01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
strategic economic move that can reshape
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
the st's role in the regional energy
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
landscape with the foreign policy
 
01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
decisions public and private focus and
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
investment in advanced nuclear
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
technology New Hampshire could transform
 
01:55:00.589 --> 01:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
its energy sector into a leading
 
01:55:02.830 --> 01:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
provider of reliable and cost-efficient
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
electricity becoming a net energy
 
01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
exporter within New England this move
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
could benefit the state economically and
 
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
contribute to a more stable and
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
diversified energy Network in the region
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
so I said energy exporter three times in
 
01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:17.870 align:start position:0%
so I said energy exporter three times in
there

01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
um I was trying to added on a uh like a
 
01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:23.719 align:start position:0%
positive you know note so if you could
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
give me your critiques on that and we
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
can make some adjustments if needed but
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
conclusion I have you know they maybe be
 
01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
trimming one of the net energy exporter
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
yeah take one of those out you know but
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
it's I think it strikes the right tone
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
can you change global warming to climate
 
01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
change I could do that
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah but so that paragraph there is that
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.030 --> 01:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
um so climate change considerations are
 
01:55:58.040 --> 01:55:59.430 align:start position:0%
um so climate change considerations are
driving

01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
driving
 
01:56:02.069 --> 01:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
nuclear I I think
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're I don't want to speak on behalf of
 
01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
the entire state but we focus more on
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
reliability and economic issues um that
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
seems to be our Focus
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
but we don't have any
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements when it comes to
 
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions or climate policies
 
01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
really so I think that's accur it's okay
 
01:56:25.069 --> 01:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
right the state's policy is all around
 
01:56:26.589 --> 01:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
cost Effectiveness that the department
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
of Energy's published so that's that's I
 
01:56:30.589 --> 01:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
think at the center of what the New
 
01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire policy is
 
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
today doesn't mean there aren't other
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
things to consider but that's the center
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
of it and the reliability is super
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
important for where we live right that's
 
01:56:48.189 --> 01:56:48.199 align:start position:0%
right all right any closing uh thoughts
 
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:51.639 align:start position:0%
um thanks everybody for coming today and
 
01:56:54.669 --> 01:56:54.679 align:start position:0%
uh helping with the Forum but would you
 
01:56:59.550 --> 01:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
microphone thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:57:04.830 --> 01:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
representative Alvin C marac County
 
01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:06.189 align:start position:0%
representative Alvin C marac County
District

01:57:06.189 --> 01:57:06.199 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
26 and I just wanted to suggest that
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
maybe you may want to add a glossery to
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
the end to cover acronyms and stuff like
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
that something like you know not
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what Hal is yeah uh and
 
01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
there may be some technical terms
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
relating to either nuclear energy or um
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
the normal electric power industry maybe
 
01:57:35.470 --> 01:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
20 to 50 terms or something like that
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
would you mind working on that
 
01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
um I could okay uh I would need to have
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
a copy of the I can send you report to
 
01:57:48.069 --> 01:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
hunt for the words that you've used okay
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing might be useful
 
01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
early into the U uh report would be a
 
01:57:59.470 --> 01:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
simple uh line graph that would uh
 
01:58:03.669 --> 01:58:03.679 align:start position:0%
compare uh energy levels say from like
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
megawatt gigawatt terawatt and what
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
they're useful for you know what what
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
will a megawatt typically power how much
 
01:58:17.069 --> 01:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
power does the city of conquer
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
use uh how many part of the glossery
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
then um you could have terawatt I'm
 
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
sorry to interrupt you you could have we
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
could have megawatt terawatt and then in
 
01:58:30.030 --> 01:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
the definition kind of explain well I
 
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
was I was thinking of of a little line
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
graph with little tick marks on there to
 
01:58:38.669 --> 01:58:38.679 align:start position:0%
point out uh say the output power of the
 
01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
bow coal
 
01:58:44.109 --> 01:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
plant um and several other things how
 
01:58:47.310 --> 01:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
much power the city of conquer uses
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
anything that people can relate to to uh
 
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
just as an idea of of how much power is
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
used okay um nothing real complicated
 
01:58:59.629 --> 01:58:59.639 align:start position:0%
can I make a suggestion sure eia has
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
state level data Maybe we just put a
 
01:59:05.550 --> 01:59:05.560 align:start position:0%
link in to to to the
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
eia the US
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
does and that links to right to New
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gives a whole bunch of State
 
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
specific profiles you know that may be
 
01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
helpful to the reader could you send me
 
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
that L yeah I'll send you the link and
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
we can put it in somewhere y
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
so Alvin I appreciate your suggestions
 
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
um you you make the same $100 a year
 
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
that I do so any help that you can give
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
would be appreciated okay thank you get
 
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
$100 a
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
year all right do we need to vote on
 
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
this or anything or so that would be my
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
next question um you know we could have
 
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
a signature page if everybody wants to
 
01:59:46.149 --> 01:59:46.159 align:start position:0%
sign it and I thought maybe I mean
 
01:59:48.950 --> 01:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
in having served on other commissions
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know you know if you're in a if
 
01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
you're like in a department position
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
that you may be reluctant to to do that
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know so um that that that would be
 
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
one option is we all sign a piece of
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
paper and we scan it my suggestion we
 
02:00:05.069 --> 02:00:05.079 align:start position:0%
would just have the chairman put the
 
02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
report and for the commission so we
 
02:00:10.030 --> 02:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
could vote on the report um with some
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
caveats right so when do we have to have
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
this in it's due in statute it's due
 
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
today which is why we have the meeting
 
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
today um but
 
02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
I think uh we could probably stretch
 
02:00:25.069 --> 02:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
that a couple of days to get to get it
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
right and I think getting it right's
 
02:00:29.069 --> 02:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
most important thing can I can I make a
 
02:00:32.109 --> 02:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
motion to approve with the suggested
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
amendments yeah is that okay second and
 
02:00:38.189 --> 02:00:38.199 align:start position:0%
then that's what I was gonna do this
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
weekend I will make all those changes um
 
02:00:44.069 --> 02:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
we would need a glossery by then can I
 
02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679 align:start position:0%
can send you this uh
 
02:00:45.679 --> 02:00:47.270 align:start position:0%
can send you this uh
document

02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:00:49.470 --> 02:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
after and then we we'll talk talk after
 
02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
the meeting on that
 
02:00:55.470 --> 02:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
um and then I'll track changes I'll
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
distribute over the weekend I'll
 
02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
distribute exactly what was changed so
 
02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
you can quickly scan it a red line
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
version Red Line
 
02:01:04.229 --> 02:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
version and then uh and then we'll
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
release what you know that final product
 
02:01:09.870 --> 02:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
so would people be willing to check
 
02:01:12.430 --> 02:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
their email on Saturday and Sunday and
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
