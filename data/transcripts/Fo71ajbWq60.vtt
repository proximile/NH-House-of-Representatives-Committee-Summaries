00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
can recognize from other legislation how
 

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.750 align:start position:0%
can recognize from other legislation how
people<00:17:58.080><c> just</c><00:17:58.320><c> put</c><00:17:58.480><c> boilerplate</c><00:17:59.200><c> here</c><00:17:59.600><c> but</c>

00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
people just put boilerplate here but
 

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.909 align:start position:0%
people just put boilerplate here but
this<00:18:00.000><c> has</c><00:18:00.160><c> to</c><00:18:00.320><c> be</c><00:18:00.480><c> examined</c><00:18:00.880><c> on</c><00:18:01.039><c> its</c><00:18:01.200><c> own</c><00:18:01.760><c> and</c>

00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
this has to be examined on its own and
 

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:02.710 align:start position:0%
this has to be examined on its own and
uh

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh

proctored examination is
 

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.350 align:start position:0%
proctored examination is

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
in two parts the the national type exam
 

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.230 align:start position:0%
in two parts the the national type exam
and<00:26:55.520><c> the</c>

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
and the
 

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.630 align:start position:0%
and the

00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
state specific
 

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.549 align:start position:0%

so<00:26:58.799><c> that's</c><00:26:59.039><c> already</c><00:26:59.440><c> in</c><00:26:59.520><c> the</c><00:26:59.679><c> law</c><00:27:00.240><c> unless</c>

00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
so that's already in the law unless
 

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:01.990 align:start position:0%
so that's already in the law unless
we're<00:27:01.120><c> right</c>

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
we're right
 

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.230 align:start position:0%
we're right
i<00:27:02.240><c> think</c><00:27:02.559><c> the</c><00:27:02.720><c> better</c><00:27:03.520><c> you're</c><00:27:03.679><c> looking</c><00:27:04.080><c> on</c>

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
i think the better you're looking on
 

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.950 align:start position:0%
i think the better you're looking on
page<00:27:04.640><c> two</c><00:27:04.880><c> there</c><00:27:05.520><c> i</c><00:27:05.679><c> think</c><00:27:06.000><c> the</c><00:27:06.240><c> part</c><00:27:06.640><c> that's</c>

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
page two there i think the part that's
 

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.029 align:start position:0%
page two there i think the part that's
better<00:27:07.360><c> is</c><00:27:07.760><c> this</c><00:27:08.000><c> one</c>

00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
better is this one
 

00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:09.909 align:start position:0%
better is this one
um

00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
um
 

00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:12.549 align:start position:0%
um
oh<00:27:10.159><c> okay</c>

00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
which<00:27:12.799><c> is</c>

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
which is
 

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:24.070 align:start position:0%
which is
which<00:27:14.080><c> is</c><00:27:14.240><c> essentially</c><00:27:14.720><c> what</c><00:27:14.880><c> i</c><00:27:15.039><c> said</c><00:27:15.360><c> okay</c>

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:29.029 align:start position:0%
 
all<00:27:24.240><c> right</c>

00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:31.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah<00:27:29.200><c> that's</c><00:27:29.520><c> that's</c><00:27:29.760><c> a</c><00:27:29.840><c> nice</c><00:27:30.080><c> way</c><00:27:30.320><c> of</c>

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's a nice way of
 

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.510 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's a nice way of
doing<00:27:31.679><c> it</c><00:27:31.840><c> in</c><00:27:31.919><c> the</c><00:27:32.080><c> image</c>

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
doing it in the image
 

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.430 align:start position:0%
doing it in the image
the<00:27:33.679><c> correct</c><00:27:34.000><c> section</c><00:27:34.399><c> of</c><00:27:34.559><c> law</c>

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
the correct section of law
 

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.669 align:start position:0%
the correct section of law
so<00:27:36.000><c> i'm</c><00:27:36.240><c> good</c><00:27:36.399><c> with</c><00:27:36.559><c> that</c>

00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
so i'm good with that
 

00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:39.510 align:start position:0%
so i'm good with that
so<00:27:37.840><c> we</c><00:27:38.000><c> don't</c><00:27:38.159><c> need</c><00:27:38.399><c> this</c><00:27:38.720><c> we</c><00:27:38.880><c> don't</c><00:27:39.039><c> need</c><00:27:39.279><c> the</c>

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
so we don't need this we don't need the
 

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.870 align:start position:0%
so we don't need this we don't need the
uh<00:27:40.000><c> the</c><00:27:40.159><c> language</c><00:27:40.720><c> or</c><00:27:41.120><c> the</c><00:27:41.279><c> language</c><00:27:42.000><c> in</c><00:27:42.240><c> the</c>

00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh bill it's going to we will replace it
 

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:47.350 align:start position:0%
uh bill it's going to we will replace it
with<00:27:45.840><c> the</c><00:27:46.000><c> amended</c><00:27:46.799><c> the</c><00:27:46.960><c> significance</c><00:27:47.279><c> of</c>

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
with the amended the significance of
 

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.870 align:start position:0%
with the amended the significance of
this<00:27:47.520><c> different</c><00:27:47.840><c> language</c><00:27:48.240><c> yes</c><00:27:48.480><c> i</c><00:27:48.559><c> think</c>

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
this different language yes i think
 

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.110 align:start position:0%
this different language yes i think
that's<00:27:49.520><c> that</c><00:27:49.760><c> meets</c><00:27:50.080><c> my</c><00:27:50.399><c> what</c><00:27:50.559><c> the</c><00:27:50.720><c> intent</c><00:27:51.039><c> of</c>

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's that meets my what the intent of
 

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.789 align:start position:0%
that's that meets my what the intent of
what<00:27:51.279><c> i</c><00:27:51.360><c> was</c><00:27:51.520><c> trying</c><00:27:51.760><c> to</c><00:27:51.919><c> say</c>

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
so i think it's
 

00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:00.950 align:start position:0%
so i think it's
okay<00:27:55.919><c> um</c>
