senate bill 383
 
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 align:start position:0%
relative to land surveying services
 
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
we have three members of our
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee here which is a quorum of
 
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee
 
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
we were expecting at least one more was
 
00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
not yet present uh representative goalie
 
00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
whose wisdom we trust is sitting in
 
00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.830 align:start position:0%
whose wisdom we trust is sitting in
um

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
the uh let if i may start um
 
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
having looked at this bill
 
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
i saw
 
00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:22.950 align:start position:0%
i saw
with

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
some problems with the new section that
 
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
have some real problems with it maybe
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
render it unworkable
 
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.390 align:start position:0%
render it unworkable
and

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
thing that i noticed
 
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
was the civil penalty is done
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
uh adjudicated by the board
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
which acts both as the judge and the
 
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
jury you have a hearing before the board
 
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.310 align:start position:0%
but it's
uh

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
they are the they're comprised of less
 
00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
of of land surveyors
 
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
appeal to the to superior court which is
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
a typical language for some of these
 
00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.950 align:start position:0%
a typical language for some of these
things

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.310 align:start position:0%
things
um

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
condom demetraki said that
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
part of his
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
motivation was to reduce clogging of the
 
00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:19.749 align:start position:0%
motivation was to reduce clogging of the
courts

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:20.550 align:start position:0%
courts
and

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
even if this
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
even if this is found
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
someone is convicted or do
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
whatever the word we want to use here
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
found by the board in violation buying
 
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars you now have a
 
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
piece of paper
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
you're still going to have to go to
 
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.830 align:start position:0%
you're still going to have to go to
court

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
you may think you may have a summary
 
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
judgment or something fast maybe i don't
 
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
i want to step back because i'm actually
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
into the bill
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
but i i want to repeat some headlines
 
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
that i've mentioned
 
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.990 align:start position:0%
that i've mentioned
um

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.110 align:start position:0%
um
despite

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
despite
 
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.550 align:start position:0%
despite
my

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
what i'm offering here is my opinion and
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
my criticism i want something good to
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
come out of this i don't know that it
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
can happen with this but i'll tell you
 
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
the direction i think we want to go and
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
i want to i'm obviously going to listen
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and
 
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
invite uh representative goalie to
 
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.790 align:start position:0%
invite uh representative goalie to
um

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
representative ryan is here great great
 
00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.830 align:start position:0%
representative ryan is here great great
okay

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative brian i'm just intro i
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
introduced open the session we're
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
starting i'm uh i started to talk about
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
specifics of the bill
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh before i invite the subcommittee to
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
chime in
 
00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
give their opinions i
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
then interrupted myself to say that i
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
want i think all of us want to see
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
something good come out of this we these
 
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
people have a legitimate gripe we want
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
to see that addressed
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
but a good idea is not necessarily a
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
good bill
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of the direction i'm
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.430 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
so we're we talked about the uh
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
now the idea of this ten thousand i
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
wondered where this came from and we
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
inadvertently did some research
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday after one of the hearings and
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
found that the medical society has a
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
similar provision fifty thousand
 
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.950 align:start position:0%
similar provision fifty thousand
medicines

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
medicines
 
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.870 align:start position:0%
medicines
i'm

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.309 align:start position:0%
i'm
bored

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
bored
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
of course of course the course the
 
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
board of medicine
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know that any this has ever been
 
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.670 align:start position:0%
i don't know that any this has ever been
done

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
and i have a
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i would support that
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
some of the older boards seem to have
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
this i don't think it's a good idea
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
pro and maybe that's why it's never been
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
actually implemented because
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
if you if somebody's practicing medicine
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
or practicing land surveying and it's
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
just a civilian
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
how does a board have the judicial
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
authority to go after somebody walking
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
down the street who's committed a crime
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
you go that's what the
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
the attorney general
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's what the courts are for you puni
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
you you're
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
licensed land surveyors are going to be
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
looking to licensure
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
suspending or revoking a license
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh part of what i also wanted to say is
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
there's no magic we can improve the
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
situation but
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know that there's anything we
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
can really
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
we can't get perfection we can't
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
you you misbehaved we're locking you up
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
the patrol's car is coming you're not
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
getting out of jail i mean that's just
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
not going to happen
 
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.230 align:start position:0%
not going to happen
the

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
we have to go through due process uh
 
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.350 align:start position:0%
we have to go through due process uh
which

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
this sort of
 
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.509 align:start position:0%
this sort of
um

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
what was my concern about the
 
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.550 align:start position:0%
what was my concern about the
um

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
judge and jury aspect of that again
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
other boards were doing it but i don't
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
support that i'm not going to man the
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
ramparts to undo that but i would have
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
never supported and speak against it as
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.710 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that it would be nice to
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
have whatever the solution uh to get
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
something about superior court but
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
probably the most
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
more important or the most important
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
thing in my view is
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
the person
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's been hurt
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
is not indemnified he's not mentioned in
 
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.110 align:start position:0%
is not indemnified he's not mentioned in
here

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
and i want to see
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
and i wait for the subcommittee to chime
 
00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:54.550 align:start position:0%
and i wait for the subcommittee to chime
in

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
i want to see the person who has been
 
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.790 align:start position:0%
i want to see the person who has been
injured

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
injured
 
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.070 align:start position:0%
injured
made

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
at least whole maybe more than all
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
legal expenses
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
whatever's need is needed to right the
 
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.910 align:start position:0%
whatever's need is needed to right the
wrong

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
now if we can
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
when i said we can't make it perfect but
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
we can improve
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
i would seek legal advice
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
ols maybe can provide it
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
can we with legislation make it easier
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
for you to pursue to get a judgment
 
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.230 align:start position:0%
for you to pursue to get a judgment
against

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
someone who practices without a license
 
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.509 align:start position:0%
someone who practices without a license
uh

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
expired license whatever
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
can we help as with the legislature to
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
do that for you
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
but i don't
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
uh so there i am
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
i think i would like to i know i don't
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
think i would like
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
personally to see
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
indemnification of the injured party
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
a more realistic
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
you might for something like this we
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
just accepted the words guilty of a
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
class b misdemeanor i have no reason to
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
this is not driving without a driving
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
without a license that's a class b or
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's a violation or something this is a
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
this is a real injury and i don't know
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
why it shouldn't be an a if you want to
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
change something that would be the first
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
thing that i would look at
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
make this an a was the possibility of uh
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
jail to
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh a has a
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty of two thousand dollars
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
and up to a year in in uh county jail
 
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.190 align:start position:0%
and up to a year in in uh county jail
um

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.150 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
which is significant because b has no
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
oh that's a fine
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
judge going to continue it it's
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
for that matter
 
00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
for that matter
anyway

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
i am interested in making this the
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
situation better i don't think we can do
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
this in time or
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
to rescue this particular bill but i'm
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
declaring i'm almost finished by the way
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
my openness to improve this i i know a
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
rivaling representative from dover here
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm done um the other thing is
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
the we have no pro
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
from what i've determined we have no
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
problem with the non-resident licensure
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
that should really probably go into
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
we're just talking a moment ago into a
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
69 and there's a roman one and make the
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
present roman one a and this roman uh b
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
of um a 69
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
roman one yes mr chair i would i would
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
like to put it because there's already
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
section 310 a69 which is on non-resident
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
licenses for land surveyors and i would
 
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
just like to put this in
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
your wording in there under roman one
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
which is the board may on application
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
and payment of the fee issue a license
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
of the lands or payer to any person of
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
any state
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
etc provide the applicant is registered
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
or licensed
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
in where in the state where the
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
requirements are equal to or greater
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
than the requirements of this state
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
so this would simply replace that
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
well actually it would
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
add the option of meeting the
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensure
 
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.750 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensure
in

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
a 63 roman 1 and 2 which are the
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
requirements for a resident
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
so this would just allow a non-resident
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
to apply for license either as a
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
licensed surveyor in another state or by
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
meeting the requirements for licensure
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
would meet the meet your desire and our
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
desire to license more people
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
appropriately without adding another new
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
section to our already fat law books yes
 
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.269 align:start position:0%
section to our already fat law books yes
represent

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:58.949 align:start position:0%
represent
that

00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:58.959 --> 00:13:59.829 align:start position:0%
that
again

00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:11.990 align:start position:0%
again
yes

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
right that's why we would revise it to
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
your the language from senate bill 277
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
which says or
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
i'm taking your language from 277 which
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
says or
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
first section the violations and
 
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.990 align:start position:0%
first section the violations and
penalties

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
i also disagree with making the board
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor and the judge for
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest that that instead of
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
trying to fix
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
that process which is
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
not our field of expertise
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
we simply say
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
take take the roman 3 the board may
 
00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:04.629 align:start position:0%
take take the roman 3 the board may
investigate

00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
actual alleged or suspected unlicensed
 
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.710 align:start position:0%
actual alleged or suspected unlicensed
activity

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
and shall support the
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
the prosecution of such
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
i mean that's what you really want you
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
want the attorney general to pay
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
attention to the surveyors and if you
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
present the case you know this person
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
did such and such
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
and we have the expert witnesses to call
 
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.990 align:start position:0%
and we have the expert witnesses to call
on

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
that will help them to take the cases
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
i also think we should recommend that
 
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.629 align:start position:0%
i also think we should recommend that
the

00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
and the planning boards
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
not accept
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
anything that is not from a licensed
 
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.389 align:start position:0%
anything that is not from a licensed
surveyor

00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
surveyor
 
00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:50.069 align:start position:0%
surveyor
which

00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think we can tack onto this
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
spill but it's something that we really
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
ought to consider for next year
 
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.990 align:start position:0%
ought to consider for next year
um

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about the
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
well madam chair what's going to say on
 
00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:03.110 align:start position:0%
well madam chair what's going to say on
that

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
i think every plan that comes into the
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
zoning board comes in with a stamp and i
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
think that's what the problem is they
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
are being stamped
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
but the clerks may not be looking at the
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
particular stamp to see if they are
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
licensed and
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
so you know it's easy to see that it's
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
not stamped the question is is it a
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
legitimate stamp
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
right and
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
my husband was on the planning board
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
said he didn't know about the town and
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
city acceptance but he was pretty sure
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
the registry of deeds did check things
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
like that so that's at least
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
one way to prevent recording an
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
incorrect map but
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
germaine to this bill and we don't have
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
but it but it's a good idea for next
 
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.389 align:start position:0%
but it but it's a good idea for next
year

00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
well no we're please to make an
 
00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.789 align:start position:0%
well no we're please to make an
amendment

00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
we will amend it i mean it's not interim
 
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.669 align:start position:0%
we will amend it i mean it's not interim
study

00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's some things we got to get
 
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.949 align:start position:0%
there's some things we got to get
through

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
i i really think we ought to push the
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
non-resident licensure through because
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's important
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh in my opinion there's no reason we
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
can't put what you just said too about
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
the board may investigate any actual or
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
suspected licensed activity and
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
recommend prosecution to the attorney
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
general and report the same to the
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
an improvement not that i might also
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
vote for making
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
while we're doing
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
tinkering in a good direction
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
i think there can be a lot of money
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
yeah this you should not be this is i
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
can recognize from other legislation how
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
people just put boilerplate here but
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
this has to be examined on its own and
 
00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:02.710 align:start position:0%
this has to be examined on its own and
uh

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
so these are the improvements but i'm
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
i'm still interested if we're talking
 
00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.310 align:start position:0%
i'm still interested if we're talking
about

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:10.039 align:start position:0%
something coming in next year
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
indemnification of the injured party
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
well that's
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
i think that's one reason to send it
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
for prosecution is that there
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
they can deal with indemnification and
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the uh
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
can they i don't know i suppose no
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's why i think we need some legal we
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
need some legal advice on it because i'm
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
i'm really hot about that what's what
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
difference does it make when
 
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.430 align:start position:0%
difference does it make when
we

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
find this guy if the guy that's got the
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
house in the wrong place or
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
he's still thanks thanks what about me
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
but for me
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh the ten thousand dollars
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know where that comes from
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
it comes from the guilty
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
oh oh where are you meaning the bill or
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
in the bill no that came from heaven
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's directly copied from the board of
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
medicine statute is my guess no there
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
but i don't think any of this has ever
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
been collected that's is my point i
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
think you put a million who cares
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative brian
 
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.430 align:start position:0%
representative brian
well

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's not your main tour but it is along
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
the same lines
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
indirectly when we had like in the city
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
somebody pulling a false alarm when i
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
was on the fire department they had to
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
come up
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
with a fine
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
and they determined what would be the
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
block of time that it took and they came
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
up with that dollar amount now whether
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
that person ever was charged with that
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
because most were juveniles or something
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
like that but maybe they didn't pay the
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
full amount but it gave the court the
 
00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:53.350 align:start position:0%
full amount but it gave the court the
authority

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
to enforce that so
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
my question also would be the ten
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is that up to ten
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars could the court look at
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
it and say
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
that you know will levy two thousand
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
so it's so it's the high end not to
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
exceed so it puts the cap so somebody
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
may only get a thousand
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
excuse me a thousand dollar fine out of
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
this well that that's fine but what i do
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
what needs to be
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
a fine-tuned is you can't i'm just not
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
in favor what i don't care if it's a
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
dollar of the price of the board being
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
both the prosecutor and
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
the jury determining what it should be
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
there's got to be
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
some i don't know quite how to do it but
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
right and that's why i i concur with on
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
your line 21 section roman numeral three
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
and to support the attorney general he
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
needs to be the prosecutor of this i
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
have nothing against the fines
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
i think that's reasonable it's just that
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
who's doing it it can't be the board by
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
itself some no i agree with somebody
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
else well i'm hoping that the courts
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
would step in on this well that's why
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
this that's why we don't want to go
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
forward with this right now we're
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
talking the same language i agree
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
um did you have anything
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
yes i really like to know hey can
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
how someone can recognize
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
a company
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
who doesn't have a license
 
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
well that's a felony if it's a company
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
but no no how we can recognize how yes
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
the person who has the stamp will
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
that would just be a matter of
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
investigation is he a freelancer working
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
for himself or is he part of a company
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what that would be well known
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
because i don't think
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
how do you find a surveyor
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
you either call a company you find
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
somebody that
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
your uncle harry recommended
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's a i don't think if
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
that's a practical problem
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
do you think so that you would know
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's an individual or whether
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
they're working for a company that that
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
would not be hard to determine
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
but in any case you've got to do you've
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
got the individual in the book
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
if it is
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
if we could get more terrific because if
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's a company it's a felony
 
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.510 align:start position:0%
it's a company it's a felony
um

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
not in what's called a not a natural
 
00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:44.870 align:start position:0%
not in what's called a not a natural
person

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative goalie do you have any
 
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.190 align:start position:0%
representative goalie do you have any
thoughts

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
one quick question um
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
let's go along with this we also were
 
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.750 align:start position:0%
let's go along with this we also were
given

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
paperwork with an amendment i believe
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
are we going to discuss that does
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
everyone have that i don't have that
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
what did the amendment say it was a
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
recommended amendment by senator the
 
00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
recommended amendment by senator the
senator

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
all right well let's
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
i'll be glad to look at that
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
all right i just want to make sure we go
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
away with this if they need this change
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
as well i haven't well yeah it's uh
 
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.590 align:start position:0%
as well i haven't well yeah it's uh
okay

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's some suggested language from some
 
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.909 align:start position:0%
it's some suggested language from some
senator

00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
oh okay this is a different way of doing
 
00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:56.710 align:start position:0%
oh okay this is a different way of doing
it

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what i was saying
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's exact that's essentially what i
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
was saying
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
except that
 
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.430 align:start position:0%
except that
um

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
rsa 310 a63 roman 1 and 2 do not specify
 
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.470 align:start position:0%
rsa 310 a63 roman 1 and 2 do not specify
the

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire specific
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
legal examination which i think is what
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
at least not in at least not as i
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
all right and that is the
 
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.510 align:start position:0%
all right and that is the
but

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
are you going to insist on the
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
whole of that of roman 1 and 2 which is
 
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.510 align:start position:0%
whole of that of roman 1 and 2 which is
the

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
so there are
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
national requirements for licensure
 
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.510 align:start position:0%
national requirements for licensure
which

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
there are national requirements for
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
light licensure that all the applicants
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
have to pass and then there are local
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
requirements or state requirements
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
so when we say you your state has
 
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.710 align:start position:0%
so when we say you your state has
similar

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh requirements and your license in that
 
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.470 align:start position:0%
uh requirements and your license in that
state

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to come here and take our
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
exam to prove that you know what the
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
boundary laws in new hampshire are
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
and then we if you're successful then we
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
issue a license
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
we need we need that step
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
because you may work in a
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
public land state you may work in
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
colorado where they don't have
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
from the oak tree along the stone wall
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
to the shore
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
they have all rectangular
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
and that person would not be
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
his experience would not be applicable
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
so we do need the exam
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
i agree we need the exam
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
not as well not as obvious to the naive
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
reader that the
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
proctored examination is
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
in two parts the the national type exam
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
state specific
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
so that's already in the law unless
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
we're right
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
i think the better you're looking on
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
page two there i think the part that's
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
better is this one
 
00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:09.909 align:start position:0%
better is this one
um

00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's a nice way of
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
doing it in the image
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
the correct section of law
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
so i'm good with that
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
so we don't need this we don't need the
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh the language or the language in the
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh bill it's going to we will replace it
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
with the amended the significance of
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
this different language yes i think
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's that meets my what the intent of
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
what i was trying to say
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
so i think it's
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
although i think you've got your in your
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
indents incorrect but that's a that's
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
something ols could fix
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:13.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
i'd like to recommend that we delete
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
lines 11 to 20
 
00:28:18.559 --> 00:28:20.630 align:start position:0%
lines 11 to 20
because

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
we don't support them
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the time to fix them
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
appropriately but i'd like to to get
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
some agreement on
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
line 21 where the board may investigate
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
but we should have an and
 
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.470 align:start position:0%
but we should have an and
uh

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
what what would do we want to say they
 
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:43.450 align:start position:0%
report that to the attorney general
 
00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:50.470 align:start position:0%
report that to the attorney general
[Music]

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
okay i want to get our the gist of what
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
we want so we're
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
by i you said delete that i that's kind
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
of what i had been leading up to all
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
along with suggestion that we
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
asked them to
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
having heard us come back with something
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
maybe next year along with um beating
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
the drum for identification i want to
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
see that somewhere
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
where the where would be most
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate to put into the
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
recording process
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
a check
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair yeah which line you just
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
said before
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
which like delete uh
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
lines 11 to 20 which is paragraph two
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
and add to paragraph three
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
the report the findings to the attorney
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
general okay because i i think that will
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
help a lot
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
in the prosecution
 
00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.510 align:start position:0%
in the prosecution
without

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
creating them as children doing we're
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
not judiciary but i would like to also
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
change b to a
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with that okay it's
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
you could have some very serious uh
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
that makes sense because judge can
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
always play they can always plead it
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
down but
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
can't go up that's not
 
00:30:10.159 --> 00:30:11.909 align:start position:0%
can't go up that's not
okay

00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.110 align:start position:0%
all right
so

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.750 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
what you you're talking about piercings
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
uh amen
 
00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:24.230 align:start position:0%
uh amen
pearson's

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
pearson's
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh thought about these stamps has to be
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
you said somewhere along in the process
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do that but that would
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
be non-germane it's a different section
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
of law but it's it would certainly be
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate at the registry of deeds if
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
not the local level
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
to verify that the stamp is from a
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
licensed surveyor what i'm saying it may
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
not solve all the problems but it'll
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
stop the biggest cases where something
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
gets recorded incorrectly
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
again bill ducette from the board of
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
licensure there already is a statute on
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
the books uh that to record a plan it
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
shall be um stamped by a licensed land
 
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.190 align:start position:0%
shall be um stamped by a licensed land
surveyor

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
surveyor
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
so for the registries that's taken care
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
of okay well thank you very much
 
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.640 align:start position:0%

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
already handled is to indicate our
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%

uh summarizing the things we've talked
 
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.149 align:start position:0%
uh summarizing the things we've talked
about

00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%

class a misdemeanor
 
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.350 align:start position:0%
class a misdemeanor

to
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
delete lines 11-20
 
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.950 align:start position:0%
delete lines 11-20
which

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
is we don't think is correct online
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
online 21 which is roman 3 adds the end
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
of the investigation that the
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%

uh makes section 2 amend
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
rsa 310a69
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
rather than adding a new section
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
but we are agree with the 10 000 laws
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
11 to 20. okay
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
get reelected so you'll see it next year
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
i will try it
 
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:19.669 align:start position:0%
i will try it
yeah

00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
oh delete that
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
yeah oh just just a deletion
 
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.549 align:start position:0%
 
63

00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
63
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
roman three
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
yes because you're covering it under
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes we don't suppose i think we're
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
put a number for the penalty i'm sorry
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to put the number the
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
whole thing is out of the night
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
for now no oh
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
when they come back we're going to talk
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
about what okay the whole of this
 
00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:15.349 align:start position:0%
about what okay the whole of this
paragraph

00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
i i think we don't have the time to do
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
it properly so if you just take it out
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.550 align:start position:0%
oh okay
because

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's not something we're experts on and
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
we don't have the time to investigate it
 
00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:27.750 align:start position:0%
we don't have the time to investigate it
thoroughly

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
thoroughly
 
00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
thoroughly
so

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
let's deal with
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
yeah john they're they're in a lot
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
better shape come walking out the door
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
all right so the idea would be that we
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
would create an amendment that does
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:00.310 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
are we
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
is that all right with you
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.109 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
would you like to move that
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
right well we don't have a number but
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
