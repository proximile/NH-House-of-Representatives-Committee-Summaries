00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
Education welcome commissioner good
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
morning and for the record Frank D blue
 
00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
Tammy Valen cour CFO for the
 
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.430 align:start position:0%
Tammy Valen cour CFO for the
Department

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.430 align:start position:0%
 
251

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
251
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
um it was curious why even though you're
 
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
already occupying the
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
building and you're in the building so
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
much more money has to be spent now for
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
modifications so that was that was a
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
curious thing we all wondered about yeah
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
so great question and I appreciate that
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
question what's not completely clear
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
from the fiscal item and I apologize for
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
that is uh the original purchase uh
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
negotiated price based upon an appr
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
appraisal with $7 million for this
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
facility um in a typical real estate
 
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
transaction there are is an inspection
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
done and there is a list of items that
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
need to be uh you know mitigated um so
 
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
the actual purchase price for this
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
building was not the $7 million it was
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
actually $6,250 so a $750,000 decrease
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
off of the capital appropriation um and
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
so working with Das they had asked us to
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
look at otherwise lapsing General funds
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
from the previous fiscal year to be able
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
to bring forward uh to be able to
 
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
mitigate some of those punch list items
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
as part of the close uh the types of
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
items that that's going to include our
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
various you know repair and maintenance
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh types of things in the building which
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
would be expected um I still think you
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
know I was thinking about this as I was
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
coming today I still think we have
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
actually got quite a good deal um I you
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
know in terms of the the value six
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
$250,000 I believe that the estimates of
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
the repair of the facility that we
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
previously were in are near know 10 to
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
15 million of continuing investment in
 
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
that building so um the facility is
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
actually working out quite nicely uh
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
it's proximate location to the highway
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
is very convenient to Educators we have
 
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.990 align:start position:0%
is very convenient to Educators we have
over

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
7,000 uh you know outside visitors to
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
the agency every year um it includes uh
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
an event space and some classrooms so
 
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
were able to conduct continuing uh
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
education for educators just yesterday
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
we had um you know a training session
 
00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:07.959 align:start position:0%
going on in several of our classrooms
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
for Discovery Education and and bringing
 
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
Educators in so uh we're happy with the
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
facility very good and this is how far
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
from your present position where over in
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
the office Park how far yeah uh it's
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
just a couple of Miles um but it is
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
actually tends to be a little bit more
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
convenient in the sense that it's right
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
on Main Street and right off of the
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
highway so again all these external
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
visitors that stop by it's very easy for
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
them to find us right off of the highway
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
and convenient for them to get in and
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
out I guess I'm not familiar with allall
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
street so it's it's the grand State
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
College building the old Grand State
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
College building right off of 93 yep now
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
I know where it is thank you further
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman thank you Mr
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
question so you say that there won't be
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
really any impact on existing programs
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
by taking more than a half a million
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
dollars from that line could you explain
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
that that it's a lot of money and that
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
the removal won't impact so these are
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
funds that we would have been lapsing
 
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
from last year that are then carrying
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
forward so uh essentially rather than
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
using the Capital Savings because we
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
procured It For Less I think Das wanted
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
to just basically use these laps funds
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
to be able to do those uh repairs on the
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
building okay thanks thank you Mr
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
chairman okay I'll entertain a motion to
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh adopt the item move to approve second
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
motion by Senator gray second by Senator
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
Bradley to approve the item further
 
00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
discussions seeing none all in favor say
 
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
I I oppose no sounds like you got a good
 
00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%

HHS good morning Nathan white Chief

Financial Officer with the Department of
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you both for
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
being here I I don't have a question but
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
I want to explain why I'm going to
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
oppose this um first of all I really
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh Mr White's uh explanation
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
it it was excellent the concern I have
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
though is we're adding five new general
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
General funded positions General funds
 
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:51.759 align:start position:0%
funded positions and I think we've made
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
clear the last couple B budget cycles
 
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
that we're not looking to grow headcount
 
00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
um in the
 
00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
department and think this is becoming um
 
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
more relevant in light of the fact that
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh next year next cycle excuse me we can
 
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
expect um a tighter budget cycle for a
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons one of which of
 
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
course is we increased Medicaid rates
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
and those are really going to hit um
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
next budget cycle the other is all the
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
co and arpa funds are expiring and I
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
don't know because we're not it doesn't
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
get reported to us how many of those are
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
actually used for um ongoing expenses
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
which will probably want to be um uh
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
continued so for those reasons um I I
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
feel that even with Mr White's
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
explanation if it was such a high
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
priority uh goal to have these five new
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
positions that would make sense to just
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
reallocate um your current Personnel to
 
00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the um question uh comment
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative f um during the last
 
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
budget cycle in House Bill 2 we we had
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that was posed that
 
00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
I just kind of want to address for the
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
committee um uh offline prior to the
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
meeting was you know what what services
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
are you stopping um and no Services were
 
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
being stopped here the funds that are
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
being used here were appropriated to us
 
00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:26.670 align:start position:0%
being used here were appropriated to us
via

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
via
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
hb2 um they they were funds that were
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
repurposed from a prior bium um and
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
there was there was a broad uh Authority
 
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
relative to the use of those funds and
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
needs have been identified to support
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
the the current and ongoing initiatives
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh where we have not had adequate staff
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
capacity and c I don't know if you want
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
to comment on that sure um as you have
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
very much um been involved in the
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
infusion of dollars um as we look at new
 
00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
programming and expanded programming to
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
address the needs of people in New
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh for mental health and
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
substance use services and with that
 
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
funding comes additional responsibility
 
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
on the department and to be good
 
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
stewards of those dollars we need to
 
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're being spent
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively and we have
 
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
seen this amazing growth um as the needs
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
um have have uh required um but we have
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
not grown the people um and the staff to
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
be able to continue that oversight and
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
today further discussion on the
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
item Senator dallis Sandra uh thank you

00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
you as as uh referencing representative
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
her questions where where are we as we
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
begin to prepare for the next badium
 
00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:06.919 align:start position:0%
with regard to this situation this is
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
got to be an ongoing situation we got to
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
we have services that we have to render
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
and uh where are we as we're pling for
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
the future sure um our department as
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
well as every other agency in the state
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
we were given our budget Targets on
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
August 1st um we are currently in the
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
process of going through and looking at
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
every class line looking at every need
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
and trying to um
 
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
prioritize those things that need to be
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely 100% need to be within our
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget as well as those items
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
that uh would be included as prioritized
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
needs so uh we're very much in the
 
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
throws of that right now um our agency
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
budget will be completed uh midt and
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
submitted to the Department
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
administrative services and published on
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
the 1st of
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
October thank you but but if I could
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
thank you but but indeed given given the
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
uh the meble with regard to the budget
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
you you're going to establish priorities
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
obviously as As you move
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
forward but with programs like this that
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're you're driving
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
forward uh they've got to be sustained
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
or maintained and I think that in for my
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
vision I'm not going to be here for the
 
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
prepar ation of the budget I'm sorry
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
you're going to miss me we will but but
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
I think uh a lot of consideration has to
 
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
be given by by this group I think as to
 
00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen move moving
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
forward because we're making these
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
commitments here uh you know based on
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
existing funds so I I think we're okay
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
for for for
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
25 I think we're going to survive 25
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
okay but I'm very concerned very
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about the future very
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
concerned so uh I think you I think you
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
have your I think you have your hands
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
full in meeting the obligations that
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
you're you're committed to here and also
 
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.789 align:start position:0%
you're you're committed to here and also
going

00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
forward thank you I appreciate your
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
Edwards what do you want me to do is
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
there a response to that um as I said
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
before at this point in time we're we're
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
looking at all of our programming and
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
all of our costs and looking at things
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
globally and at a micro level and um we
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
haven't made any decisions yet but those
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
will be reflected in the coming weeks in
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
our budget and I agree with your
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
commentary yes it will be challenging it
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
challenging representative thank thank
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh and and thank you for uh
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
taking the question this is this is more
 
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
a a strategic overview question we have
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
tried in the last two budget Cycles to
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
uh be very aggressive at funding it
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
Investments for infrastructure and and
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
one of our um thoughts driving that has
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
been to give the department the
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
productivity tools it needs to have in
 
00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
order to uh continue to redeploy
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
Manpower to the highest value uh tasks
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
and and I've I've heard you read your
 
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
email and it's a great email like
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
representative Earth said and I've heard
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
your answer I I just I'm just wondering
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
to what extent uh do you and and we can
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
take most of this answer offline but I'm
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
just curious are are we starting to see
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
the impact of the money that we've spent
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
the last two budget Cycles on it in
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
terms of productivity
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
improvements and are they are they
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
discernable are they
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
describable sure so um I I think Dave
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
weeders our our chief operating officer
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
would be uh most qualified to answer
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
that question but in this past budget
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
there were two Appropriations in hb2
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
specifically for it Consultants one to
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
help us with the design and two to help
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
us with implementation and there has
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
been ongoing work across the department
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
to implement Salesforce based Solutions
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
as well as some other e signature and
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
and uh expedited processing but um yes
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
we have seen improvements in that but I
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
think what's important to recognize is
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
that that's not necessarily going to
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
eliminate the need for positions I think
 
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
with every legislative cycle uh both at
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
the state and federal level we continue
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
to have additional reporting
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
requirements additional programming
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
requirements put on the department that
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
continues to take away the resources
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
that we have so while I do think that
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
efficiencies are incredibly important to
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
gain through those I just want to also
 
00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
recognize the fact
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
that the the Baseline operating needs
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
well absolutely agree government's
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
growing we're asking more and more of
 
00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
you absolutely agree with your point I I
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just keep this other point
 
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
distinct though are are we seeing uh
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
payback in terms of increased
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
productivity as a result of the it
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Investments sure would it
 
00:22:29.789 --> 00:22:29.799 align:start position:0%
would it be acceptable if I had um d
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
weers uh follow up with some detail
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
specific details on the various uh
 
00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799 align:start position:0%
programs that have been implemented
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
would that be helpful right right and
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
and and if you just because we're in a
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
budget cycle it's going to be a big
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
question next year particularly so we
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
don't need an immediate answer but it's
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.679 --> 00:22:51.310 align:start position:0%
 
excellent

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480 align:start position:0%

discussion seeing none those in favor
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
say I I oppose no no no two two nose um
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
the rest are eyes so you wish to be
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%

00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%

here I read the item it says approval of
 
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.350 align:start position:0%
here I read the item it says approval of
1,838

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
1,838
 
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:48.039 align:start position:0%
351 when I look at the item I don't see
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
that figure
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
repeated and we were trying to figure
 
00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
out how that figure came to be and took
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
some rather imaginative moving figures
 
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
around to come up with it is that in
 
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
7659 that is a great question for the
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
record Sherry Rockburn uh assistant
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner Department administrative
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
Services um I'll have to take a take a
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
look at the difference um I didn't
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
notice a math error when I we were
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
reviewing it so I'll have to take a look
 
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
to see what that variance is normally
 
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
it's the combination of um both
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
accounting units so there's a
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
combination of 444 and the 72,000 that's
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
getting moved within the accounts um so
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
I'll have to I can get you a detail
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
sheet of sort of exactly how that comes
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
up I think what's throwing it is that we
 
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
have a both the ins and outs of 1.3
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
million that's coming out of one accy
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
unit and there's uh significant numbers
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
of coming into the accounting unit so
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
I'll have to look at the math for you to
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
break that out I know we did look at
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
that but I'll take a look at it give us
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
a wave when you got your figures done
 
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
yep sir just give me a few minutes and
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
I'll take a look sure we'll uh Skip by
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
it for
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
now and we'll go on to tab
 
00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:32.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
and I believe it was representative
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
Edwards had questions on these are
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
incentive payments and yes sir do we
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
want D yeah we'll we new folks introduce
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
yourselves good morning I'm David chy
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
the deputy Medicaid director I'm here
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
for Henry
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
Litman and welcome back Mr White
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
CFO um so so this question is um I'm I'm
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with the proposal I I just have
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh some questions as I understand the
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
the process and and I I need you to
 
00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm mistaken is is that we
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
withhold 2% of the premium payments to
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid M the
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
mcos so that we can create some
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
incentive goals some stretch goals for
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
them to achieve that further uh State uh
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
policies and priorities and to the
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
extent that they hit those get paid
 
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
those on a on a timely basis but any
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
money that's not spent out to pay for um
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
an incentive payment gets with with
 
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
withheld and stored until the sometime
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
after the accounting period of the
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
contract closes and all of that money
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's withheld still needs to go back
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
to the mcos is is that
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay so with that in place m
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
my questions are um do the
 
00:27:07.549 --> 00:27:07.559 align:start position:0%
mcos know how to book any anticipated
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue that may come back to them
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
through the payment of the unpaid out
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
incentive programs in other words do
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
they have an accounting concern if they
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
don't have enough data to adequately
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
know I I don't
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
know but they do know the total
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
capitation amount um and the the total
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
amount of funds available and what's
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
been earned up to a period of time and
 
00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:40.039 align:start position:0%
what's left over um and they would be
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
able to account um I think on their
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
books and and I I think the challenge
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
that they have and and I'm not in the
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
weeds but and you are but I think the
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
problem that they have is that there is
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
they know the pool but they know that
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
there are three mcos and they don't know
 
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
the meth methodology in which you will
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
carve up the remaining un unspent
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
balance and as a result of not knowing
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
the methodology you will use to um to
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
make a proportionate payout they are uh
 
00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
hesitant to book An accounts receivable
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
does that does that and I I I I I maybe
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
maybe you could just take that away and
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
think about it and and talk to the mcos
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
about it um uh and then I may I follow
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
up follow up
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
um now I I I'm I'm a big believer in
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
stretch goals and but there seems to be
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
two things at play when we do stretch
 
00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
goals or incentive goals is that U there
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be some hope that the stretch
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
goals are
 
00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:48.039 align:start position:0%
achievable um we don't want to create a
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
stretch goal that we know or or should
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
know is really not achievable um and and
 
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
you know sort of mess with them without
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
any chance of success that's one thing
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing is some of these stretch
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
goals will would need to be in place for
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
one two three years to let the these
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
kind of Battleship
 
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
mcos move towards where we're directing
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
so in your opinion do you think we are
 
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
coming up with uh
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
adequately uh stretched goals not
 
00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:23.799 align:start position:0%
overstretched and do you think we're
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
leaving them in place long enough to
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
become achievable
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
I do so we do look at
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
um the the you know the likelihood that
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
the MCO could potentially reach the goal
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
without making it too easy but also
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
without making it too hard um and for
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
certain goals you know we want to see
 
00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
you know A continuing Trend over because
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's a five-year contract over over a
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
period of time um so when you look at
 
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
the current contract that we're about to
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
go live with on September first one of
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
the goals is the new Primary Care Focus
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
model um and health risk ass assessment
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
completion and so that would sort of be
 
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
a a ramp up of like in year one we would
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
like to see this and that we would
 
00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:06.519 align:start position:0%
likely keep that metric in future years
 
00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:09.559 align:start position:0%
seeing continued growth um similar with
 
00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:10.350 align:start position:0%
seeing continued growth um similar with
lead

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
lead
 
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
screening um but then there are also
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
more short-term goals um that we want to
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
incentivize the mcos with um for example
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
in the unwind we wanted the MOs to help
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
with Outreach and redetermination so
 
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
that was more of a a focused um shorter
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
term goal because the the unwind had an
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
end end start a definitive star and end
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
date um or we somewhat
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
definitive um so so thank you Mr chair
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the answer um and then uh
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move to pass this if there's
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
no other discussion all right motion to
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
approve is is there a second second by
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
Senator Susi further discussion seeing
 
00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:51.519 align:start position:0%
none uh motion was to approve
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
24256 is there any U are you ready for
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
the question all in favor say I oppose
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
nay that item is adopted please stay
 
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
seated we'll be right with you in a
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
minute I'm just going to announce that
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
257 has
 
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
been removed and we're moving on to
 
00:31:10.639 --> 00:31:12.750 align:start position:0%
been removed and we're moving on to
258

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
258
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
and this was another
 
00:31:18.629 --> 00:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
one that speaks about dish payments you
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
may want to bring another on I have a
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair on Senator gay since
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't talk about
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
257 um uh before we took the vote to
 
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
pass all the other items on the consent
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
calendar um it may be wise to have a
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
motion for
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
reconsideration on that motion and then
 
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
pull it and then have the vote again but
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm looking towards uh
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
legislative sure um so 257 was withdrawn
 
00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
by the department the letter itself is
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
the necessary action to remove that so
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
um no additional once that letter is
 
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
submitted the item is no longer under
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
consideration so no additional motions
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
are necessary okay thank you okay okay
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
now we come to U
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
24258 dealing with Dish
 
00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:16.519 align:start position:0%
payments and I believe somebody had a
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
question about the state plan Amendment
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative Edwards yes sir thank
 
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:24.200 align:start position:0%
you so um you I'm sure you recall that
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of this uh legislative
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
session there was a lot of discussion in
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature about whether or not the
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
dish payments should be paid out to the
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh at a 91% or maybe a 93% or
 
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0%
somewhere in between and and the
 
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
legislature failed to agree to anything
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
in the committee of conference and
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
therefore the governor uh has stated
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
publicly that um he's going to uh
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
uh distribute 80%
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
uh with the idea of keeping the other
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
20% for other community services and so
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
that was the last I had heard about this
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
was back in early early July I'm just
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's any update that you
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
could give us relative to what we're
 
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
doing with the disproportionate share
 
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:28.549 align:start position:0%
doing with the disproportionate share
distributions

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh good morning David chy again Deputy
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director um so uh we are
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
following through with the 80% plan we
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
don't really have an update um on the
 
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
80% plan right now but with respect to
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital and Dish payments
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
under the prior met settlement agreement
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
and the um prior State Statute uh New
 
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital is not included in
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
the The Met dish settlement so for
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
purposes of the 91% or 80% calculating
 
00:33:57.519 --> 00:33:58.389 align:start position:0%
purposes of the 91% or 80% calculating
it

00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
um any of the funds New Hampshire
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
hospital pays outside of that um and
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
that's because under federal law there's
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
a separate allotment for imds which is
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital um and so there's
 
00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
that anything further I I I don't have
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
questions Senator Dall Sandra thank you
 
00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.629 align:start position:0%
questions Senator Dall Sandra thank you
Mr

00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
chair just for point of clarification
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
the dish deal is in the deal that we had
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
is in place they've already paid the be
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
they should have been reimbursed for
 
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
this year it's the New Deal that
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
begins is that isn't that correct so the
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
80% we asked for a change in the plan
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
and so forth but that's for the future
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
right correct I want it to be clear that
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
the hospitals got 91% back because that
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
Arrangement was in place and it had it
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
was in existence and A Change Is for for
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
for the next Val so uh that has to be
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
dealt with by the
 
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
legislature uh because the current deal
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
expired right and so so they got the 91%
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
back at at this point in time it's for
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
the future uh that that this 80%
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
situation will be discussed by the
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
legisl governor has one idea but I think
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
the legislature has has an option to
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
work on that and and to make its own
 
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.270 align:start position:0%
work on that and and to make its own
decision

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to that I I I I find that uh
 
00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
this situation this 80%
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
nonsense have been done
 
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh Fiat
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's in my opinion not the way
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
to not the way to do business this
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
legislature should have a say in that we
 
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
all have hospitals in our districts
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
we're all being serviced by those
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals those hospitals uh are
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
performing and we had a we had an
 
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:56.599 align:start position:0%
arrangement that was in place for a
 
00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
period of years that uh we thought was
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
failly successful I think the hospitals
 
00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:02.839 align:start position:0%
did too so this change that's going to
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
take place going to have to be dealt
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%

want to give you some more yes I agree
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
with everything you just said I wanted
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
to understand what the status was
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
several months later because we're R in
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
the we're running out of time in the
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
house to submit legislation and I just
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
want to let the the Senators know that
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:53.800 align:start position:0%

upcoming year is 315 refugees that are
 
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
coming from countries outside of Ukraine
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
and Afghanistan or Cuba or haa those are
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%

categories so the standard Refugee
 
00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:31.079 align:start position:0%
resettlement program that we're
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
anticipating for the upcoming Federal
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year is
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
3155 and these are all covered with
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
federal funds yes this is a Fed fully
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
federally funded program across the
 
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
country um and the state the federal
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
government works um with each state and
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
allocating um the number of refugees we
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
you representative Earth Do you happen
 
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
to know how many of these programs that
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
are letting these quote refugees in are
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
the result of executive orders as
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
law in the executive order you're
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
referring to like the ukrainians and
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan those emergency humanitarian
 
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
or no specifically with the 315 others
 
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
that you're referring to the others no I
 
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
don't know which ones are related to
 
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
executive order there's there they
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
anticipate a number of refugees from
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
certain com um countries each year right
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
that are dealing with civil wars or
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
religious persecution or what have you
 
00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:41.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure which ones are related
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
to executive order or not okay thank
 
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
right representative Edwards uh uh thank
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
you um and thank you Miss Landry for
 
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
taking the question uh I I I think I
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
think just to sort of restate where I I
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
I I believe State policy is on this and
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh and hope that you all are executing
 
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
it when no one's around is that is that
 
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
um uh we understand the refugee program
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
we understand the federal money that's
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
coming to it and there and so there are
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
questions around whether or not the
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
federal funds are adequate if they cease
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
to become adequate we we should be
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
getting a heads up that the the money
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
isn't keeping up with the the the
 
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
federal obligation that's one thing and
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
then the second thing is uh there are
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
other categories other than refugees uh
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
there are I don't think Asylum Seekers
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
count as refugees and certainly the Goda
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
ways don't count um as as either Asylum
 
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
Seekers or refugees uh are are we making
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
explicit um Endeavors to ensure that uh
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
Goda ways are not receiving state
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
benefits other than those mandated to
 
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
ERS what what's the status of our in our
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
making sure the Integrity of of the
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility I guess yes thank you so I
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
can't speak to how emergency rooms
 
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
across the state serve any population
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
right that's that's up I mean there's
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
the they serve whomever comes into their
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
emergency room but that is completely
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
separate from our Refugee resettlement
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
program in which we have Federal Refugee
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
resettlement agencies that are um part
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
of the nine I think it's eight or nine
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
federal resettlement agencies that have
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
local branches and the only the only
 
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
individuals who are served by the
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
federal funds that come through this
 
00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
program are those legal refugees that
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government says they're
 
00:41:59.950 --> 00:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
ready for New Hampshire it does there
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
are C there are you're right you know
 
00:42:04.109 --> 00:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
humanitary PE that's where the Ukrainian
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
status is or all there are ases there
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
are special immigrant visas they're all
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
part of the federal Refugee resettlement
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
program and some of those categories
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
receive like these cash of medical and
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
some do not it just depends on the
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
status but the only individuals for
 
00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
which this program serves are the legal
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
Refugee refugees that come through this
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
program so there it's very much vetted
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's there's lots of federal reporting
 
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
there's no discrepancy of of what the
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
these dollars are for they only serve
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
those refugees that come through the
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
program and and and did you say that the
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
federal funding so far has been adequate
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
to the task oh I apologize to your first
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
question yes as far as we know that in
 
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
fact we've had um they've increased the
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
amount of funding in the last couple
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
years due to the Afghan population that
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
has arrived as well as ukrainians that
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
continue to arrive so there has been
 
00:42:55.549 --> 00:42:55.559 align:start position:0%
more than adequate funding to to serve
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
this population
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair if there aren't any
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
other questions I'd move to approve
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
second motion by representative Edward
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
second by Senator asso to approve item
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
24270 is there any further discussion
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none all in favor say I I oppose
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
no that that is adopted I'd like to now
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
three and call on Sher Rockburn
 
00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
thank you I apologize for not having the
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
math uh in my head a little bit sooner
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
so there's three numbers that make this
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
up the first if you look at the very
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
first page the transfers out of
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
444,000 plus the
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
72,000 those two numbers total 51
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
7444 in addition to that there's another
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
transfer out of 1 million
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
32097 it's on page two and it's line um
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
022 so on page two of the 1.3 million
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
plus the 500 and 17,000 those numbers
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
make up 1 18 38 351 that's in the
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
total so I'll give you a minute to take
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
a look at that but the the total that's
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
always written in the letter is the sum
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
of the transfers out even though there's
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
ins and outs that sort of would offset
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
it we just focus on the all the negative
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
numbers which are the transfers out and
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
those will that 1838 351 which is
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
correctly stated in the requested
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
action thank you all right so the figure
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
is correct but it's just not spelled out
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
in a way that's easily recognized and we
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
can make that change on future one so
 
00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:45.559 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit more clear appreciate
 
00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
it uh any further discussions on item
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
24264 second Senator gray moves the Adam
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley second any further
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none you ready for the
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
question all in favor favor say I oppose
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
no the item is adopted thank you for the
 
00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
seven and we had item 241 the only item
 
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
I had a question it it talked about
 
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
giving these
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
um to communities that were low and
 
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
moderate communities where do I find a
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
list of who's a low low and who's a
 
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.109 align:start position:0%
list of who's a low low and who's a
moderate

00:45:44.109 --> 00:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
moderate
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
Community good morning Mr chairman for
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
the record Josh Elliot director of the
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
division of policy and programs with the
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy um
 
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question so US EPA
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
um who is granting us these funds has
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
divised has just excuse me defined low
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
moderate income is the household making
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
less than 80% of area median income or
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
less um across the state So that
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
obviously varies by County um that
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
aligns with um Housing and Urban
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
development's um threshold for living in
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
subsidized housing for example oh it's
 
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
by county and if you're
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
lowincome you're only making 80% of the
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
average income in that county correct
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay and then that is is then controlled
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
for um by household size as well thank
 
00:46:34.109 --> 00:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
you I was curious about that and where
 
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
would I go to look at up where that
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
figure might
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
be is it under the EPA or is it some
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
under the census or um I can I'd be
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
happy to provide the committee uh with
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
the list where it has the breakout of
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the state for those
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
figures appreciate it thank you because
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
we're all wondering if Okay can my
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
communities qualify well are they low
 
00:46:56.589 --> 00:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
are they moderate what are they if if I
 
00:46:58.829 --> 00:46:58.839 align:start position:0%
may follow up it's not necessarily the
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
community itself it's the individuals
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
who meet that criteria so you could have
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
for example a very wealthy community
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
where somebody happens to be making 80%
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
or less of area median income in that
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
Community they would qualify so there's
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
no restriction in terms of where the
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
person lives or where the household
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
lives anybody who meets those criterias
 
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
would be would be eligible to benefit
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
all right so it's an individual that
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
gets the grant not the not a community
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
system well it would be a um the the
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
individual or the household that
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
qualifies would be able to receive the
 
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
benefits from the installation of these
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
arrays the arrays themselves would be
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
installed um depending on how where they
 
00:47:40.589 --> 00:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
come in the door so to speak um either
 
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
by uh grants provided by the Community
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund uh the New Hampshire Housing
 
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority or the uh through a
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
grant through the department itself

eight last one we have a question
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
question so there has been some
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
notoriety about this activity recently
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
and I did hear from representative groda
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
from Ry um looking for a commitment and
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
transparency and more public
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
participation which I guess maybe
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
over uh thanks for the question so we uh
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
did address a little bit of that on the
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
8th at at our last PDA board meeting um
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
of this month uh also I'm working hand
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
inand and letting the planning board
 
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
know for Ry uh what's happening keeping
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
them in contact with everyone and we're
 
00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
going to um we're in the process right
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
now of having a couple of more public
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
meetings um not in between now and the
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
next board meeting as well well so um
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're just trying to be as transparent
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
as possible as well as with the other uh
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
project that's in Portsmith to for the
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
commercial fishing
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
pier okay I guess that's all I have Mr
 
00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you thank you uh
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
discussions with the previous director
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
were about retail on on the Ry Ry Harbor
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
and he and thank you for the photos you
 
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
sent us it looked like parking would be
 
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
a problem and I remember he he EXP
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
express that to me that you know that
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
you couldn't have retail there and still
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
have parking for the fisherman and the L
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
fill up the parking lot and take their
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
boats out and may not be any space left
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
for retail so wonder how we're dealing
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
with that is there a project in mind you
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
going to enlarge the whole Space you
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
going to make more parking or what thank
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
you thanks for the question sir so right
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
now the commercial fisherman park over
 
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
on the commercial Pier side uh haven't
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
had any complaints about parking uh so
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
far or but but you are correct if we
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
move forward with the proposed plans it
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
would uh incorporate a little bit of the
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
parking that we use right now for the
 
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
recreational side and commerci and
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
recreational fishing and those folks
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
that are attending for the
 
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%

wanted to make sure everyone who
 
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
here um I'm going
 
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680 align:start position:0%

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it over to to attorney Raymond
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
to give you an overview but I'll just
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
start by sort of setting the context
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
here we're here today to get approval to
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
the revisions to the guidelines and the
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
other documents for the YDC claims
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
process these revisions are are really
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
just meant to implement the revisions
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
that we just made with in this past
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
legislative session so as you'll recall
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
we had extensive negotiations with with
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
clayman's Council um to come up with
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
revisions to to the YDC claims process
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
that would result in the vast majority
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
of the claimants coming through the
 
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
process as opposed to going through
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
litigation so that bill passed in the
 
00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
last session after the bill was signed
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
by the governor in June we we've had a
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
lot of discussions with clayman's
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
Council since then to come up with the
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
revisions or these revisions to the
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines and you will have received a
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
letter from Nix and pebody and and and
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
Riley and Associates that indicates that
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
they are I would say supportive of these
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
revisions I don't want I don't have the
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
letter in front of me but I I think what
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
they said is with these revisions while
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
there was negotiation and they didn't
 
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
get everything they wanted we didn't get
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
everything we wanted this was a
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
sufficient compromise for them to
 
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
continue to feel that they could
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
recommend this process to the vast
 
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799 align:start position:0%
majority of their clients um so that
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
that is the product you see before you I
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
certainly want to thank Nick and pebody
 
00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
and Riley and Associates and and all the
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys involved there and all the
 
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
other claimant Council for coming to the
 
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
table and engaging in these negotiations
 
00:55:07.789 --> 00:55:07.799 align:start position:0%
I want to thank everyone who's here
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
today with me for for the work on this
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
the work that's been done so far and and
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
the work to come uh with that I'm going
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
to turn it over to to attorney Raymond
 
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
just to give you an overview of the
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
biggest pieces of these revisions and
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
then I'll certainly be here to answer
 
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
questions as well but Laura spearheaded
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
the the details of this so I want to
 
00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
give her a chance to to give you that
 
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
overview for discussion purposes the
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
committee we're looking at both 261 and
 
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
262 which are very closely related so if
 
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
you have questions on either one this is
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%

00:55:42.559 --> 00:55:44.069 align:start position:0%
the the moment but go ahead and give us
the

00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
explanation thank you and good morning
 
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
um so I would be happy to walk through
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
um in the order of our item the um sort
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
of overview of what the proposed
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
revision to these documents are we've
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
also provided to the committee today um
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
a handout a one-page handout that
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
summarizes those changes to both the
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines governing um the value of
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
claims as well as the process believe
 
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
those were just handed out to hopefully
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
guide um this overview as well just back
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
up from the mic about an inch or two
 
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
sorry about
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
that thank you so uh first with respect
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
to the uh claims process
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
as attorney general for Mela mentioned
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh the main driver of the proposed
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
revisions there was the changes to the
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
statute that passed in this most recent
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
legislative session so the changes there
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
are really focused on updating some
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
timelines um to bring the claims process
 
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
as it previously existed in line with
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
those new amendments um another
 
00:56:51.789 --> 00:56:51.799 align:start position:0%
significant procedural change outlined
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
on your handout uh is the fact that the
 
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
claims administrator now has the
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
discretion under the statute to
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
determine whether to award uh payments
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
from the fund in a lump sum or in
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
installment payments over time that is a
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
change from the uh previous practice
 
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
where the claimant uh had the discretion
 
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
to make that election so that is also
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
reflected in the changes um to the
 
00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:22.839 align:start position:0%
process that will help I think ensure um
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
the stability and solvency of the fund
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
over time for many more claims to come
 
00:57:31.029 --> 00:57:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh we also um again in looking at those
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
um time frames we're looking to expedite
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
certain parts of the claim process to
 
00:57:39.309 --> 00:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
that end um the process also now allows
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
for um brief oral arguments by council
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of a resolution proceeding
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
again a change to the previous process
 
00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
one that I um we've sort of been beta
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
testing uh for lack of a better word in
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
resolution proceedings and I think is
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
going well so far and will ultimately
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
in an expedited process of uh Awards
 
00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
being issued uh after follow following a
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
resolution proceeding um and finally uh
 
00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
the new statute as amended provides that
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
instead of submitting a complete Claim
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
by the deadline of June 30th 2025
 
00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.039 align:start position:0%
claimants can instead submit a notice of
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
claim form that is included with the
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
item for approval today and when a
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
claimant submits that form um they are
 
00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
essentially putting the fund on notice
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
that they intend to submit a claim but
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
maybe don't have all of their complete
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
materials right now and they have 60
 
00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:38.039 align:start position:0%
days following the submission of that
 
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
form to submit a completed claim um so
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
that's also a change from the current
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
process so in lie of filing a full
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
complete Claim by June 30th 2025 they
 
00:58:50.829 --> 00:58:50.839 align:start position:0%
can also file a notice of Claim by that
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
date and still be extended 60 days to
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
file their complete claim those are sort
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
of a high level um overview of the
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
changes to the process I would be happy
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions about that
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
specifically or continue through to the
 
00:59:05.119 --> 00:59:06.309 align:start position:0%
specifically or continue through to the
guidelines

00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
themselves senator dallesandro for a
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you thank you
 
00:59:10.799 --> 00:59:11.549 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you thank you
very

00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:11.559 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
much stuff you said this was was fine
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you I did get the letter from the
 
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
lawyers and it seems to me that there in
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
there in concurrence with the changes
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
that have been made u i I would like to
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
know the number of people who have filed
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
claims this number has been bounced
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
around I I think in the letter they
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
talked about 1,00 somebody said about 15
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
how many claims have been filed what is
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
the number of claims that we're dealing
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
with at this time yes so that number as
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
642 um Miss uh Foley or Tom may have an
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
updated number it's 632 okay 632 and
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
that's just to clarify that's claims in
 
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
the claims process were you asking
 
01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
Senator about that and also about
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
lawsuits filed or just claims in the
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
claims process the number of the number
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
of individual who are involved in in the
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
in the legal aspects of this this is
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
lawsuits in your administrative work yep
 
01:00:21.069 --> 01:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
I I I think lawsuits it's it's 13 to
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
14400 at this point I I don't have that
 
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
exact number on top of my head so so
 
01:00:28.109 --> 01:00:28.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's a realistic number that
 
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
that's I've heard that a a variety of
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
numbers I'd like to focus on what the
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
real number
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
is U as as I think the public should be
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
aware of that obviously when you look at
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
that and when you look at what's
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
happened in terms of the settlements you
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
got X number of dollars that are out the
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
door you're expecting you know an
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
additional appropriation that that's
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
going to come I think we should have at
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
least anide idea of how many cases we're
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
dealing with I I think Senator when we
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
get to June 30th 2025 that will be the
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
point where we get the final number of
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
of claims that will come through this
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
process um you know we we can we can
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
make a projection of what we think it
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
will be but you know we we won't know
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
the final number until then but but I
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
think the
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
projection is extremely important
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
because that projection is going to call
 
01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.750 align:start position:0%
because that projection is going to call
for

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation yep and some somebody
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
around this St was going to have to make
 
01:01:31.079 --> 01:01:32.069 align:start position:0%
around this St was going to have to make
that

01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation yes well and that that
 
01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
gets to and this isn't necessarily part
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
of the the guidelines and the process
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
today but that that gets to you know the
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
payment well the payments over time are
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
part of the process but then the $75
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
million cap per per fiscal year so so
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
yes we when we were going through the
 
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
legislative process we discussed the
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
fact that the sooner we have the
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
deadline for
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
the window to close the sooner we will
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
finally be able to say this is how many
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
claims came into the process this was
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
the total amount claimed and we you know
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
based we've resolved about 200 claims
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
now and the average award has been
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
maintaining around
 
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
$500,000 so I think once we get the
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
total number of claims in and we know
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's it we'll be able to make a
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
projection sort of over how many years
 
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to continue funding
 
01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:27.799 align:start position:0%
this given the cap of $75 million per
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
year thank you thank you Mr
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
CH representative Lehman for a question
 
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I had a few but
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
I'll certainly go through the chair on
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
page 12 there's a mention of a a maximum
 
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
of three
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
hours for the discussion of a
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
claim what happens if it has to go over
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
3 hours this is just a suggested
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
guideline or or is this in fact that 3
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
hours hour the gabble comes down and
 
01:02:57.359 --> 01:02:58.510 align:start position:0%
hours hour the gabble comes down and
that's

01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
it in my experience um with resolution
 
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
proceedings and and and having attended
 
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
them and having uh gotten information
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
about each one that has occurred
 
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
actually none have come close to 3 hours
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
that's because it's I you know it's it's
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
a very difficult conversation for the
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
claimant um the victim to have and it's
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
not the intent I think of anyone in this
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
process either from our office or from
 
01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
the administrator's office to continue
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
to sort of compound that by dragging it
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
on for the full 3 hours they often don't
 
01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
go that long I imagine if it had to No
 
01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:35.240 align:start position:0%
One Would object to a continuation of
 
01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.390 align:start position:0%
One Would object to a continuation of
additional

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
time a further question further question
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
I think it was on page 22 in
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
my notes here
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
um the payment out over time I think is
 
01:03:52.109 --> 01:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
up to 10 years is that something you've
 
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
tried to get already or people willing
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
so I can speak to that um we are
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
starting to implement the considerations
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
for that uh the claimants that I have
 
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
seen information on so far um none
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
have uh affirmatively expressed a a
 
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
willingness to go for a full 10 years
 
01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
but many have expressed a willingness to
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
do some sort of of payment plan that
 
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
being said the discretion to award that
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
payment plan is vested in the
 
01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
administrator considering the claimant's
 
01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
financial circumstances um and the other
 
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:39.799 align:start position:0%
uh items delineated uh in the statute
 
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
such as health and things like that um
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
but it is remains fested in the
 
01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:46.950 align:start position:0%
but it is remains fested in the
administrator

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
regardless one and I would I would just
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
add that we're in very early days for
 
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:53.799 align:start position:0%
for the new sort of the new provision
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
that that allows the administrator to
 
01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:56.589 align:start position:0%
that that allows the administrator to
meet

01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
meet
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
to award these or make these Awards and
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
installments so I think we'll be we'll
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
be better place to to give you feedback
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
on that in in the months
 
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
ahead one final question if I could Mr
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you I know we're all
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
sickened by what happened you know here
 
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
over the decades and I looked at like
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
the guidelines for the payouts for
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
particular types of assault where did
 
01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
those guidelines I know we've talked
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
about this in the past and I think some
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion was made out the states were
 
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
looked at are these new Baseline award
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
amounts are these new numbers that
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
you've come up with or are they based on
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
past so I can uh speak with respect to
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
the new uh award values that were
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
assigned uh in the guidelines themselves
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
which is um the next document up on uh
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
the discussion um so for those um dollar
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
amounts we did do um some research
 
01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
search into things like what uh claims
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
for similar type of conduct have settled
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
for um in other states within this state
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
um and tried to you know develop a a
 
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
baseline uh award amount that seemed
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate in light of um the conduct
 
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
being alleged versus the conduct uh in
 
01:06:20.829 --> 01:06:20.839 align:start position:0%
the remainder of the guidelines the
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
dollar values for which had already been
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
approved by the committee so it was sort
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
of trying to uh you know place it in
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
that Matrix which already existed um
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
considering a wide range of factors
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
including um you know how often it
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
occurred the severity um all of those
 
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
factors were considerations and in fact
 
01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
those dollar Figures were part of um
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
what was open to negotiation with
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
claimant's Council and we did have many
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
conversations both with the Nix imp PE
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
Law Firm about those values and what
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate as well as Council
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
for other claimants too so that was
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
achieved with a a broad measure of
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
consensus I would say thank you thank
 
01:07:04.589 --> 01:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
chairman other
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
members Senator Susi thank you Mr
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
chairman just one if I may I just wanted
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
to clarify the 632 number is all
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
inclusive so some of those may be
 
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
withdrawn or
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
deemed not worthy of following through
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
the process so 632 is everything
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
presented that's true and some some have
 
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
been resolved by now as well great thank
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
you uh without any additional questions
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
on the process I would be happy to turn
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
more fully to the guidelines um we've uh
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
just begun discussing them but again
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
just to uh give you an overview of the
 
01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:45.799 align:start position:0%
major proposed changes to those
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
documents um the first was to address
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
the new categories of abuse um added by
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature in the most recent
 
01:07:57.309 --> 01:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
amendments specific Al uh those were
 
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
unlawful restraint um both isolated
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
confinement and placement in physical
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
mechanical or pharmaceutical restraints
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
both of those are uh defined as unlawful
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
restraint under the new statute uh also
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
unlawful strip search intentional
 
01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
infliction of emotional distress
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
Reckless conduct criminal threatening
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
and invasion of privacy so we slotted
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
all of those new categories of
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
compensable abuse into the existing
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
framework of the guidelin lines um per
 
01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
the the Mandate in the new statute
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
there's also a mandate in that uh
 
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
amended statute to provide compensation
 
01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
for egregious sexual abuse so we um
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
included that definition in the
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines as well and explained the
 
01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
standard for compensation there uh
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
finally the other major change um was
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
just to update the aggravating factors
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
that are found near the end of the
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
guidelines that can increase uh an award
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
if certain things take place the statute
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
um added a couple new categories of AG
 
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:03.799 align:start position:0%
aggravating factors um mainly a greater
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
impact of the abuse on the claimant as
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
compared to others similarly situated um
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
subjection to multiple forms of um
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
sexual and other abuse
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and participation by more
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
um than one actor physically in an act
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
of sexual or other abuse so those were
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
the main changes to those guidelines
 
01:09:25.159 --> 01:09:25.990 align:start position:0%
the main changes to those guidelines
there

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
um again would be happy to uh take any
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
additional questions from the committee
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
members about
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
those I think you really open the door
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
or at least the legislature did by
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
adding this other and including solitary
 
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
confinement this opens the door for the
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
SEC the secure housing unit in the
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
prison where all of the people there are
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
in solitary confinement 23 hours a day
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
if we think that's
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
compensable through a lawsuit we're
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
really in trouble all those people could
 
01:09:58.110 --> 01:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
go and get these same lawyers and come
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
back and sue us saying oh I I was really
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
tortured by the four years I spent in
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement this this really
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
opens the door and another thing that
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
disturbs me and it supposedly is left
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
left to the attorney general is why we
 
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
don't more widely use lie
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
detectors um my friends in La
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement really put a lot of faith in
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
them and you might eliminate a whole
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of these people if they couldn't
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
pass a lie detector test and that would
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
be a lot quicker than the three hours
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
that you're going to might spend on all
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
these questions on all the people
 
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
involved it seems like it ought to
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
be an automatic review that everybody
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
goes through this I and supposedly it's
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
left to your authority to do this and I
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
wonder why you haven't asked for
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
it so I'll respond to both of those
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
points Mr chair the first just to just
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
sort of opening the door to solitary
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
confinement or intentional Affliction of
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
emotional distress and other
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
incarceration settings like like the
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
prison I I just point out a couple
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
things one you know this this is you
 
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here the cases
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here are unique
 
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
because when these things occurred these
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
individuals were were kids so kid yes
 
01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
they were in a Juvenile Detention
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
Facility but but they were kids for whom
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know the state was not we weren't
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
just the intention was not just to lock
 
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
them up but also to to rehabilitate them
 
01:11:23.709 --> 01:11:23.719 align:start position:0%
to to get them Services get get them
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
treatment so I I would point out that
 
01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.470 align:start position:0%
treatment so I I would point out that
first

01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
second the the compensable solitary
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
confinement for purposes of this process
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's only compensable if there's there
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't some legitimate basis or or
 
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
reason or it was or um it's only
 
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
compensable if it was excessive so it's
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
not to say that any time someone might
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
have been placed in solitary confinement
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
that would be compensable it's if there
 
01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't I mean I'm paraphrasing so so um
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
so I want to be a little careful but
 
01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
basically it it has to be that there
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a legitimate basis or some
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
some other some other good reason for
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
for the solitary confinement um to your
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
point on the lie detector test I mean it
 
01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:06.910 align:start position:0%
point on the lie detector test I mean it
it

01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
really that is just part of the overall
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
consideration of this process um in in
 
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
balancing the the need to you know have
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
some level of verification and
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
investigation of these claims with with
 
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
the need to um recognize that we're
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
talking about individuals who who who
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
were victims of physical and sexual
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
abuse when when they were children we
 
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
certainly would never if someone came to
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and said that they had
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
been abused as a child I mean not even
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
as an adult but as a child we certainly
 
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
would not put them through a lie
 
01:12:42.629 --> 01:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
detector test it's just not how we how
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
we treat victims of of sexual abuse
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
especially but we we absolutely would
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
not do that if we're talking about child
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
victims and and we we have other ways
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
especially in the law enforcement
 
01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
context to look to to verify whether
 
01:12:58.629 --> 01:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
someone's telling the truth we have
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
there's other interview techniques I um
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of study and work put
 
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
into those techniques over over many
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
years and decades in in in the law
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community but but we
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't use lie detector tests in that
 
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
context and I
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
think you know in is in this context
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to balance the need
 
01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
to to you know do some verification
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
investigation with with the need to
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
respect the fact that these are that the
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
these are these are victims of physical
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
and sexual abuse and victims who suffer
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
this abuse as as kids a lie detector
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
test just isn't isn't something that I
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
think would be appropriate especially
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
for for a process like this it really
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be appropriate in almost any
 
01:13:43.229 --> 01:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
context but this is meant to be a
 
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
process where it's not litigation so
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not doing the sort of
 
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
indepth type of Discovery and
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
investigation that would happen in
 
01:13:54.629 --> 01:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
litigation over a period of a couple
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
years before you got to
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
trial it's it's a it's a more
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
streamlined simpler process and the
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
tradeoff is that while we may not do as
 
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
much in-depth investigation and and
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
verification there's a cap on on the
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
damages you can get and you know I think
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
the the first Tri the first YDC trial
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
showed and and putting aside EV I won't
 
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
get into the details putting aside all
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
of the issues we litigating there post
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
trial about what what the damages cap
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
should be and how the law works on that
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
I mean I think you saw where where a
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
damages number can can be in a case like
 
01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
that and I think that demonstrates the
 
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
tradeoff we we're making in this process
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
when you go to trial I wish you'd
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
emphasize to the jury where this money
 
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
is coming from with some of these
 
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
ridiculous claims it's not coming from
 
01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
the actors who probably are still
 
01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.189 align:start position:0%
the actors who probably are still
collecting

01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
pensions very few of them I think one
 
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
has been up for trial so far and I think
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
you got 11 people identified they all
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
should have been
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
and trial by now and been charged with
 
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
these abuses and should perhaps confront
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
some of
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
these people that they abused as Youth
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
and you should also make the point that
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
a person who worked hard all their
 
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
life and kept their nose clean and and
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
prepared themselves for a good career at
 
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
the end of a career might have two
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
million doar that they earned in their
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
lifetime you're giving $2 million to
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
people who didn't know the rules
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
probably didn't have a a good career and
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
yet they're being rewarded to some
 
01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
extent for suffering which many people
 
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
have suffered without being able to get
 
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
compensated in family situations and so
 
01:15:42.629 --> 01:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
on it just seems way out of line with
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
what these juries are reward are
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
rewarding and I'm wondering if you're
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
bringing any semblance of Truth to them
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
that this money is coming out of you
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
folks because it's coming out of the
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
taxes that the government collect
 
01:15:57.629 --> 01:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
it's not coming out of the actors and
 
01:15:59.550 --> 01:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
we're giving these huge Awards what do
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
they prove the lawyers get rich and the
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
person wastes the money and I think that
 
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
that point should be made a little more
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I can just assure you Mr chair
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
that for for the cases that do go to
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
trial you know we we certainly are doing
 
01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
everything we can to defend them and and
 
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
I would I I feel pretty confident in
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
saying that I don't think we've gotten
 
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
to the extent the office has gotten
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
criticism for the cases that we're
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
litigating it is not been that we that
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
we haven't been pushing hard enough to
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
to defend them so we we if the cases go
 
01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.070 align:start position:0%
to defend them so we we if the cases go
to

01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
trial we are thinking long and hard
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
about what the best way is to defend
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
them and the most effective way is to to
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
defend them and what the best argument
 
01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
and presentation arguments and
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
presentations we can make to to a jury
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
are so I I can assure you of that thank
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
you further from the committee Mr chair
 
01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
Senator gray I'm kind of uncom in some
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
of the things that we've said here okay
 
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
we've passed legislation and right now
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
we're has that legislation been
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
truthfully you know fulfilled in in the
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
documents and for us okay so again you
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
know we may want to do some other
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
changes in legislation but right now is
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
not the time to to do that right now we
 
01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
should be looking at the document does
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
it fulfill the the requirements we put
 
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
in the legislation and then move
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
forward further questions from the
 
01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.790 align:start position:0%
forward further questions from the
committee

01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:33.159 align:start position:0%

here to the governor to our friend Karen
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
umberger who
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
sponsored House Bill 1677 this is
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
a very difficult
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
sad and awful
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
chapter in New Hampshire history the
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
trial the mean trial showed how bad the
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
abuse was a jury um you know found a
 
01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.830 align:start position:0%
abuse was a jury um you know found a
settlement

01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
of a huge amount of
 
01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.350 align:start position:0%
of a huge amount of
money

01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
existed both pieces of
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
1677 worked assiduously to
 
01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
protect victims because there are real
 
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
victims here victims of abuse in the
 
01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.629 align:start position:0%
victims here victims of abuse in the
state

01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
care and as the Attorney General's
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
office and attorney broadrick um and his
 
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
capable staff have um worked through the
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
200 cases that have been settled we've
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
actually learned quite a bit
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the legislation that I believe we
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
all voted for um certainly in the Senate
 
01:19:22.629 --> 01:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
we did and I believe in the house it was
 
01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
passed on a Voice vote um um also has a
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility to protect the long-term
 
01:19:32.669 --> 01:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
Financial viability of the state so the
 
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
point that representative Lehman earlier
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
made um about structured settlements I
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
think it's important to remember that
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's a 5% interest payment for any
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
structured settlement is is left in the
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
authority of administ administrator
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
broadrick um
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
and I think the whole process has tried
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
to balance those issues protecting the
 
01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
victims and a victim Centric
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
approach but at the same time the
 
01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
long-term viability for the state this
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
is likely to be a 7 to 10 year process
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
at at $75 million
 
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
a um budget year in every fiscal year I
 
01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.270 align:start position:0%
a um budget year in every fiscal year I
I

01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
think this is a long-term issue that
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make the best out of a
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
very bad situation for doing what's
 
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
right for victims but also protecting
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
the state and I I think all of you
 
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
deserve a lot of credit for that um you
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
know the letter that John you didn't
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
have um in front of you that I have from
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know Russ Riley and um Dave Vin
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
canano um does does talk about you know
 
01:20:59.709 --> 01:20:59.719 align:start position:0%
the collaboration the consensus and not
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
everybody got everything they wanted it
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
was the same thing in Senate Bill 591
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
but people came together because
 
01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
um it just it has to be done I guess is
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
the best way of saying it and um so I
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
think it's important that those of us
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
that are you know that voted for the
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
legislation recognize this I I went
 
01:21:28.030 --> 01:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
through you know the 50 or so pages of
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know the new um
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines it really means a lot to know
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
that the administrator the Attorney
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
General's office and you know the lead
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
councils have all come together on it in
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
the same way that 591 did so that's why
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
I think we should move forward approve
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
these guidelines um get back to you know
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with the at least 432 other
 
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
cases that are in front of you and
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
probably hopefully the vast majority of
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
the other ones and do your job and we
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
should trust the process and this is why
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
I know there's been questions
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
about you know the extent of the cost of
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
administering this and the point that
 
01:22:17.669 --> 01:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman raise is a very
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate one of
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
verification and that's why it's
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
important in my op opinion that attorney
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
brri have the necessary staff to um do
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done to a protect the
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
victims but also vet the testimony and I
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
think um so far so good it is a very
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
difficult situation uh one that
 
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
obviously none of us wish would have
 
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:49.719 align:start position:0%
ever happened um totally needs to be
 
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
prevented in the future and um try to
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
put this very sad chapter of New
 
01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:58.760 align:start position:0%

have two late items yes uh that need
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
action and then one informational item
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh the first late item being
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
24273 request Department of Health Human
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
Services to accept $6 million in arpa

Senator Bradley to approve the item 273
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
question from representative Edwards is
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
there someone here that can answer
 
01:24:49.709 --> 01:24:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
Edwards I I may have spoke too too
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
quickly uh I'm I'm interested in the one
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
the new late item that has the $6
 
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
million of arpa money is this it this is
 
01:25:08.669 --> 01:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
it okay so um so hi uh so my question on
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
this is is that we had a stablished I
 
01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
think the by we I mean the the governor
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the Royal Wei from there uh the
 
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
principle that we should take onetime
 
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
money and spend it on onetime
 
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
investments and uh
 
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
my simple reading of this uh is that
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're taking this money and uh
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
augmenting sort of an operational
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
capability um and if that's if that's
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
wrong I just need to be told I'm wrong
 
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
and and and two if I'm not wrong um I'd
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
like to know uh if if if we're setting
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
ourselves up for failure because this
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
money won't be available uh isn't
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
presumed to be available in the future
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
budget Cycles are we are we are we
 
01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
inflating the the budgets of the of our
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
U federally qualified Health Facilities
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh and we're not going to be able to
 
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
sustain it so those it's kind of a
 
01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.790 align:start position:0%
sustain it so those it's kind of a
conversational

01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
conversational
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
question good morning Trisha Tilly I'm
 
01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
the associate commissioner at the New
 
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
Services thank you so much for that
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
question representative Edwards so
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
you're right that has been the policy
 
01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
moving forward is onetime money for
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
one-time events it has also been the um
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
the practice to use some of these arer
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
dollars to fill the holes for
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
operational losses experienced during
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 pandemic and so the
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers have
 
01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that they have had some
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
operational impacts and these funds will
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
help fill those losses to your forward
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
thinking question around like okay so we
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
fill a bucket what happens next is a
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
part of these funds will will be used by
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
the federally qualified Health Centers
 
01:26:58.750 --> 01:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
to determine a sustainability plan for
 
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
financing moving forward they um had
 
01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
some uh hits in the way that the entire
 
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
Health Care System were had impacts
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic but in particular
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
because the fqhcs are open to all they
 
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
have um their charge is to serve the
 
01:27:16.109 --> 01:27:16.119 align:start position:0%
uninsured the underinsured allc comers
 
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
who walk in the door they had a
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
disproportional impact they are also
 
01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
having some other structural issues from
 
01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
some federal um constraints around
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
things like 340b funding and some other
 
01:27:29.229 --> 01:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
pieces and of course they've been
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
impacted by Staffing in the way that
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
every organization especially every
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
Healthcare organization has been
 
01:27:37.149 --> 01:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
impacted so these funds will be awarded
 
01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
to them on a need basis um looking at
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
their losses in a very similar way that
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
we did with the Community Mental Health
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
Centers which again is another one of
 
01:27:48.910 --> 01:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
our safety net services so we want to be
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
able to have them keep their doors open
 
01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
and that's that's good business for all
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
of us here we have to have the qhcs um
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
sustained uh within the state or else it
 
01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
would have a catastrophic effect on our
 
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:01.719 align:start position:0%
entire Health Care system so we want to
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
keep the doors open we also want them
 
01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
looking forward to figuring out what's
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
the best path um moving from this day
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
forward in terms of their sustainability
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
plans and their Finance
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
plans follow
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
up all right I so I I remain concerned
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
that we're spending long-term money on
 
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
operational items the the pandemic has
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
been over for a while and I don't know
 
01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
how much longer we can uh justify trying
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
to repair that but but but you're
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
working it um my my other my other
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
question is is this is this U $6 million
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
the result of of a top down this is the
 
01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
money we have let's let's put it out
 
01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
there or is it the result of a Bottoms
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
Up needs assessment to to determine what
 
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
the what the requirement is for the $6
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
million which it it looks more like top
 
01:28:58.990 --> 01:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
down let's spend what is available thank
 
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
you I'll take that question as well um
 
01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
so we didn't propose this again this
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
request came directly from the federally
 
01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Centers to gopher they
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
put forward a proposal they put forward
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
their budgets they put forward their um
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
financial needs and this was determined
 
01:29:14.669 --> 01:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that was needed so I
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
I am sure that there was other and you
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
know commissioner Caswell can talk more
 
01:29:21.149 --> 01:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
about that process but um they put the
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers put a
 
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
proposal forward saying these are our
 
01:29:28.109 --> 01:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
needs and um we this is our plan to
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
address those
 
01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
needs okay so I I one last one I so I
 
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
guess it's Mr casual question it just
 
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
seems to me that you all are allocating
 
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
the $6 million and it it strikes me that
 
01:29:43.109 --> 01:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
we have all of these open construction
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
projects that are probably doing cost
 
01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
overruns and I'm just I'm just wondering
 
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
if uh how confident you are that this is
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
the best way to allocate $6
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
million I am confident that by investing
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
in our federally qualified Health
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
Centers we will save money in the long
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
term from uncompensated care in other
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
System yes if there's no questions for
 
01:30:12.159 --> 01:30:15.790 align:start position:0%
System yes if there's no questions for
these

01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
people ask Mr Caswell to come forward
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
this director good morning Taylor casell
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Evers I can jump right
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
into your your question so this is a
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
this is a request that's been pending at
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
Gopher for several months we haven't had
 
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
the uh uh ability to put the money that
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
they had initially requested which I
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
believe is closer to 8 million do was
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
the total request from the health
 
01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
centers um our staff working with HHS
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
did do uh an assessment of the need of
 
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
this program and I think um commissioner
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh Tilly spoke very well to the out
 
01:30:55.629 --> 01:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
comes of that in terms of when we
 
01:30:58.109 --> 01:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
determine the need uh for these
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
operational Investments which you are
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
correct we have avoided it at at great
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
at great um effort um but in this
 
01:31:09.109 --> 01:31:09.119 align:start position:0%
instance uh it is definitely related to
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
covid impacts for the health centers
 
01:31:15.629 --> 01:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
themselves and I think that um our my
 
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there are other um
 
01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
accommodations on the federal side that
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
should be coming in the future that will
 
01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
help offset these long term uh impact so
 
01:31:28.109 --> 01:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
these are one-time operational impacts
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
that we felt were necessary to make an
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
investment in at this
 
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
time so so thank you for that I it looks
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
like Senator Bradley may have a question
 
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
but if there's no other commentary i'
 
01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
I'd move the
 
01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:46.950 align:start position:0%
I'd move the
item

01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we already have a motion in a
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
second all right if there's no further
 
01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.430 align:start position:0%
second all right if there's no further
discussion

01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
the question is to adopt item
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
24273 it's already been moved a second
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%

chairman I maybe Mr White could um
 
01:35:26.109 --> 01:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
help me with this so this was the item
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
withdrawn and um I just wondered if we
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
will see this item come before us again
 
01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
and if it does will it have the same
 
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
purpose as um the item that was
