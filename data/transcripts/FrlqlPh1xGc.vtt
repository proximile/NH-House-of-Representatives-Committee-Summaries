private employers
 
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 align:start position:0%

the granite state

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
that leverages both the state and the
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
private market
 
00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
and we're confident that this is a
 
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
productive path forward for the state
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
and from there i'll turn it over to dj
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
and then we're happy to go through the
 
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.670 align:start position:0%
and then we're happy to go through the
bill

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay matt thank you very much dj why
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
don't we turn to the
 
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
top of page 31 because basically it's
 
00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
just the title at the bottom of page 30
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
line 4 begins the purpose and policy
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
do you want to kind of address that
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
section so if you could do line 4
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
through 22 or 321 we'll see if we have
 
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
sure madam chairman what i can also do
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
as well if i may is i prepared some
 
00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 align:start position:0%
remarks this morning for you that kind
 
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
of just lays the overview of the plan
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh highlights some of its features and
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
then um
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
and then we can obviously i'm gonna have
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
matt lead the section by section but we
 
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.230 align:start position:0%
matt lead the section by section but we
can

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
answer questions and support him as well
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
so if if i may madam chairman just very
 
00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.230 align:start position:0%
so if if i may madam chairman just very
briefly

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
as you know in my previous role in the
 
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 align:start position:0%
governor's office i was an advocate for
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
approaching paid family medical leave
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
and the approach that is before you
 
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.309 align:start position:0%
and the approach that is before you
today

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
however in my rule my new role over at
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
the insurance department i'm here this
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
morning to be
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
a resource to uh the committee and to
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
highlight some of the
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
more prominent provisions of this plan
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
than obviously as i said to answer any
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
so the structure that is before you this
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
morning is similar to
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
many of the previous proposals the
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
governor in the governor's office has
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
put forward in the past with the most
 
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.230 align:start position:0%
put forward in the past with the most
prominent

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
prominent
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
and fundamental feature being that this
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
program will be administered by
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
a private insurer who will serve as the
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
state's vendor for the program
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
there has been at least two proposals
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
prior to this and some of the details
 
00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:26.150 align:start position:0%
prior to this and some of the details
have

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
evolved over time and so i'm going to
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
try to break this
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
conversation into two pieces uh the
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
first piece will be how
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
it works and then the second piece will
 
00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:37.270 align:start position:0%
it works and then the second piece will
be

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
how individuals and businesses will
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
access the product
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
and then what the coverage will entail
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
so before i take you through the plan i
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
would note that many of the features
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
and adjustments to this plan came as the
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
result of a request for
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
information that the insurance
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
department put forward
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
in 2018 and it seeks to incorporate
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
the feedback from the insurance industry
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
on how best to approach these types of
 
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.710 align:start position:0%
on how best to approach these types of
insurance

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
products the first feature to note is
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
that access to this coverage
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
is universal for state employees this
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
will be a benefit provided to them by
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
and those approximately 10 000 employees
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
will serve as the foundation
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
of the risk pool for this product for
 
00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:24.550 align:start position:0%
of the risk pool for this product for
businesses

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
businesses will have the flexibility to
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
opt into the coverage for their
 
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.309 align:start position:0%
opt into the coverage for their
employees

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
for those businesses that choose to
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
participate they will retain the
 
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.670 align:start position:0%
participate they will retain the
flexibility

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
to determine how they want the premiums
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
to be handled that is to say
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
they can either choose to provide this
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
as a fully paid benefit to their
 
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.670 align:start position:0%
as a fully paid benefit to their
employees

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
they can choose to split the cost with
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
or they can have the employee pay for
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
the coverage entirely on their own
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
if the business does choose to
 
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.070 align:start position:0%
if the business does choose to
participate

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
this plan creates a business enterprise
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
tax credit
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
that will be used to incentivize
 
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.949 align:start position:0%
that will be used to incentivize
participation

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
participation
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
which obviously has the intended desire
 
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:08.790 align:start position:0%
which obviously has the intended desire
to

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
further drive down premiums fifty
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
percent of the premium that an employer
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
pays for this coverage
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
can be claimed as a credit against the
 
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.630 align:start position:0%
can be claimed as a credit against the
bet

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
bet
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
so dj yes what section am i going to
 
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
find that bet tax credit in in hb2
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'm at a little bit of a disadvantage
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative i have an older version
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
matt if you could help me yes that is on
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
page 40
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
section 74. details the terms of the bet
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
tax credit
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
and we'll come back to that we'll come
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
back to that thank you matt
 
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you dj you betcha so um
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
so again so that's the that's the tax
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
credit piece
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
if a business chooses not to participate
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
or if the individual is an independent
 
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.310 align:start position:0%
or if the individual is an independent
contractor

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
or simply wants to access this product
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
entirely on their own
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
they will have that access to individual
 
00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:04.230 align:start position:0%
they will have that access to individual
coverage

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
premiums for the individual opt-in group
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
will be stabilized by a premium
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
stabilization reserve fund
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
and uh anticipating the question matt do
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
you want to cite that section
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes i will one second and let me find
 
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.269 align:start position:0%
yes i will one second and let me find
that

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
we're giving matt lot to do today that
 
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.470 align:start position:0%
we're giving matt lot to do today that
is

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
on page 38 it is within the same section
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh it is line 15 which is 282
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
dash b colon 5. awesome
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you matt so this model of a
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
premium stabilization reserve fund
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
is based on the state's medicaid
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
expansion program
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
where the portion of the insurance
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
premium tax derived from plans offered
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
under the granted advantage program are
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
used to pay
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
the non-federal share so this mechanism
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
will also help to limit the weekly
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
premiums for individuals in this group
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
to five dollars or less per pay week
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
i just take this opportunity to
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
highlight that five dollars per pay week
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
and where that number came from
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
so as i said in my previous role i was
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
heavily involved in this
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the governor's office and that five
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
dollars per pay
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
per pay period number came from
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
advocates of paid family leave who had
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
done these types of
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh programs and put together these types
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
of products in other parts of the
 
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.430 align:start position:0%
of products in other parts of the
country

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
and what they had told us was that five
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
dollars was kind of the
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
the red line by which if you went above
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
that it would begin to serve as a
 
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.949 align:start position:0%
that it would begin to serve as a
disadvantage

00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh for people to seriously consider
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
taking up that product so
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
with that number in mind we've designed
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
this to
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
do everything possible to keep that
 
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.230 align:start position:0%
do everything possible to keep that
premium

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
premium
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
below that threshold so that covers a
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
little bit on how to access the coverage
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
now let's talk a little bit about what
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
will be covered
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
so this plant provides sixty percent of
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
wage replacement for six weeks
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
the maximum duration of wage replacement
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
shall be six weeks per year
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
with no minimum duration required and if
 
00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:09.910 align:start position:0%
with no minimum duration required and if
you're

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
cj excuse me if you're following along
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
at home guys that's at the page at top
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
top of the page 33. thank you dj
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman um so
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
the things that will be covered let's
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
turn to that so the first
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
is the birth of a child or the care of
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
the newborn child within
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
one year of birth the placement with an
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
employee of a child for adoption or
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
foster care
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
and the care of the newly placed child
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
within one year of placement
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
caring for the employee spouse child or
 
00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:42.710 align:start position:0%
caring for the employee spouse child or
parent

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
who has a serious health condition any
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
qualifying extingency
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
arising out of the fact that the
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
employee's spouse child or
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
parent is a covered military member
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
on covered active duty or caring for a
 
00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:57.430 align:start position:0%
on covered active duty or caring for a
covered

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
service member with a serious injury or
 
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.629 align:start position:0%
service member with a serious injury or
illness

00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
illness
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
if the eligible employee is the service
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
member spouse
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
child parent or next of kin and finally
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
a serious health condition of the
 
00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.230 align:start position:0%
a serious health condition of the
employee

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
that isn't related to the employment to
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
their employment
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
and their employer does not offer
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
short-term disability insurance so
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
a couple of things as it pertains to
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
that last eligibility category
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
the first is obviously uh if the
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
reason for the leave is related to their
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
employment that's going to be covered
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
by their workman's compensation uh and
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
then the second piece
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
is around that that first person
 
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.189 align:start position:0%
is around that that first person
coverage

00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
and that was the the subject of some
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
discussion last year
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
a large portion of costs associated with
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
paid family medical leave are tied to
 
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:47.990 align:start position:0%
paid family medical leave are tied to
the

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
disability portion of the coverage
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
and the thought last year was that since
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
most new hampshire employers have
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
short-term disability benefits
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
the goal was to avoid cost that was
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
deemed to be
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
duplicative coverage and that being said
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
this was the source of some
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
passionate disagreement so to address
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
that concern
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
this plan includes first-person coverage
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
if their employer does not offer that
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
short-term disability insurance matt
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
again can you tell us the line in the
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
page for the short-term disability
 
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.949 align:start position:0%
page for the short-term disability
insurance

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
matt that's the provision in the
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
independent the the business and
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
individual coverage
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
so this is page 37 line 24
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
okay that's good enough we'll get to
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
that later i'm just trying to make sure
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
we get all these references down
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
to time together thank you guys thank
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
both of you please dj continue
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
of course thank you madam chairman so to
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
conclude this discussion i'm
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to briefly touch on some of the
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
additional features
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
so the first is job protections so
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who work for an employer
 
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:07.910 align:start position:0%
individuals who work for an employer
with

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
20 or more employees will have job
 
00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:11.590 align:start position:0%
20 or more employees will have job
protection

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
now here again there has been a bit of
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether that should be
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
50 employees which would mirror the
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
federal family medical leave act
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
or whether it should be some number
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
lower than that
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
the governor ultimately decided that the
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
number should be 20.
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
but that's obviously something that you
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
will have to consider whether that
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
you feel that that's the appropriate
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
number obviously um
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
more protection means the greater
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
likelihood that people will be motivated
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
to access
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
the coverage the more people in the pool
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
the better the premiums
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
second is through the rfi process
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers and
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
legislators have raised the issue that
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
the individual opt-in group may
 
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.310 align:start position:0%
the individual opt-in group may
experience

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
adverse selection this new plan revises
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
and tries to address those concerns in
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
several ways
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
the first is that there will be an open
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment period for individuals
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the opt-in group and that will be
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
limited to once a year
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
it will last approximately two months
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
the second is that the rating
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
will not be grouped with the state
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
employees or the other employers of the
 
00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:19.430 align:start position:0%
employees or the other employers of the
state

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
and it will be based on the claims
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
experience of that particular group
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
and finally there will be a seven month
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
vestment period
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
to allow the program to become
 
00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:31.509 align:start position:0%
to allow the program to become
capitalized

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
capitalized
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
now i understand that some of these
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
features may not be
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
the most popular of this plan but if you
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
want to guard against
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
adverse selection and again ensure that
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
you are driving down those premium costs
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
to below five dollars per pay period
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
then from an insurance standpoint
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
this is how you'd approach it okay dj
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
i do have a question if i could
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
represent policeman
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair is your mic on yes it
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
is good for you
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm learning after about a couple okay
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
mary beth you're training us
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
so uh if we could back up you mentioned
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
the protections for
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh folks that are i guess
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
companies that have 20 or more
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
individuals what about the
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
20 the companies that employ less than
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
20 individuals
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
what kind of protections if any are
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
there for them
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
so there are no current protections in
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
terms of that that guarantee that the
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
individual will not
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
lose their job if they uh need to step
 
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.470 align:start position:0%
lose their job if they uh need to step
away

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
from their from their job uh for any of
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
the qualifying conditions
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
and what i would just add to that and
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
this is at the bottom of page 37
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
line 36 roman 3
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
employees of those companies that don't
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
qualify for the job protection elements
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
are have the opportunity to join the
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
individual purchasing pool
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
to receive those same benefits
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
so basically matt i'm not sure i
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
understand but
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative leishman asks what
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
happens if you don't work for somebody
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
who has 20
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
employees and your answer is there is an
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
individual protection
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
component that individuals in smaller
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
businesses could join if they chose to
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
do so is that correct
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
that's correct and that section begins
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
on page 36
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
and i apologize that we're jumping
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
around that's all right we pro
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
i'm making little notes i suppose
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
everybody else is representing leishman
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks madam chair
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
so if an employee is disciplined or
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
faces some sort of action is fired what
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
state agency
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
would he go to to file a grievance
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
against the employer
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
for such a inaction by an employer
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
against that employee
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
so just so i understand the scenario
 
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:01.830 align:start position:0%
so just so i understand the scenario
this

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
is an employee that participated in this
 
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.909 align:start position:0%
is an employee that participated in this
benefit

00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
and was then fired because they took
 
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.190 align:start position:0%
and was then fired because they took
right

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
pardon this benefit dj is that something
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
that that you could speak to this might
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately be decided through rules i
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's a specific
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
section of the legislation that
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
addresses that
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
um thanks matt so representative
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
leishman are you referring to an
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
individual who
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
if we were if you were to set that bar
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
at 20 or more employees and they were
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
they were terminated as a result of that
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
where they would go to have that
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
addressed yeah or if they learned that
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
they thought their employer was holding
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
money back or taking the five percent
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
a week for that benefit and then learned
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
that the employer was not putting that
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
money aside where would they go
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
to file such agreements i think it's
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
five dollars a week not five percent or
 
00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:52.310 align:start position:0%
five dollars a week not five percent or
five

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
five dollars a week right well i
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative leachman i think uh it
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
could go a variety of places uh
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative services
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
will administer this program
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh but if an employer was charging a
 
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.029 align:start position:0%
uh but if an employer was charging a
premium

00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
premium
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
and not providing the benefit our
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
consumer protection
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
division here would have something to
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
say about that
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay but that's that's not in the bill
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
as of yet that's something you develop
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
later as far as rules is that your
 
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.950 align:start position:0%
later as far as rules is that your
understanding

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
or is that in rules that you have for
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
your agency overall
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
well it there isn't a rule specific to
 
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.549 align:start position:0%
well it there isn't a rule specific to
this

00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
to this potential fraud that would be
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
there but it
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
um but it is both
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
i i think in theory it's a violation of
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
our statute for charging in church
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
proving that you're not
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
provided the commissioner of ministry of
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
services is going to administer this
 
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.430 align:start position:0%
services is going to administer this
section

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
and so i assume uh they would be uh
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have rules there as well
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
thanks venom cheer okay please continue
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
madam chair i'm sorry i'm sorry
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative patcher i did not see
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
your hand up my apologies please ask
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
when i chaired gel car i missed a lot of
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
hands myself um and thank you for that
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
my concern is exactly that rules
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
i often hear that that could be
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
addressed in rules um
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
having served on gelcar for a number of
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
terms having chaired that committee
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that's what we need to hear
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
rules just that would be um
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
mandating the gel car legislates and
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
a big no-no so to speak
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
and if something's not laid out in a
 
00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:45.669 align:start position:0%
and if something's not laid out in a
bill

00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not clear that that's the
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
legislative intent
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
for that activity to happen um under
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
541a um that's really not something that
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
goes forward in rules there has to be an
 
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.630 align:start position:0%
goes forward in rules there has to be an
indicator

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
indicator
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere that that's the desire so to
 
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.549 align:start position:0%
somewhere that that's the desire so to
expect

00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
expect
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and i'm sorry man i'm sure with the
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
lack of the better terms things that are
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
missed in the legislation
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
and this often does happen um and
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
expecting rules to address that
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh not a good plan and i'm not you can't
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
guarantee that that would be
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
addressing rules so my thought is it
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
needs to um
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
i guess there needs to be a further
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
explanation of representative
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
bleachman's question
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
other than it will be addressed in rules
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chief and representative
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps what i would say to that is if a
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
company is defrauding its employees
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
the state already has existing
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to address that
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
outside of any particular program and i
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
think to commissioner nicholas's point
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
those existing pathways would continue
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
to exist
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
so if i name adam chair follow-up paulo
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
well that that would be considered fraud
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
with that you have to talk about intent
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
and all sorts of things
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of things that it's
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
clear that uh
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
that there's protection there and and
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer but i
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh we have lawyers on the committee i'm
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
not sure that's something that would be
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
captured under fraud thank you madam
 
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:11.830 align:start position:0%
captured under fraud thank you madam
chair

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
you know what i think what i could offer
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
is i i could have my team
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
put in a reference to our
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
insurance statute regarding charging
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
premiums and not providing a benefit
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh to make it clear i'll put that
 
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:25.990 align:start position:0%
uh to make it clear i'll put that
together

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that we would have
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
authority uh
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
to assess administrative penalty and to
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
administer those claims could you do
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%

00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
to um me
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
and to lba nancy levines and michael
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
hoffman today electronically
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
or get that to matt and matt knows how
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
to get it to us so
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
we can do that representative walsh you
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
have your hand up for a question
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
do you have a question i do thank you
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
very much manager
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
so i want to go back a step and revisit
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
so if we've got
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
somebody say they have 20 or more
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
employees say somewhere between 20 and
 
00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:09.669 align:start position:0%
employees say somewhere between 20 and
50

00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
50
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
and they is some sort of retaliation or
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
some sort of
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
problem that arises because of what the
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
employer is doing because somebody has
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
chosen to exercise their rights under
 
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.149 align:start position:0%
chosen to exercise their rights under
this

00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
you suggested the department of
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
administrative services is where they go
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
there is no enforcement division there's
 
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.029 align:start position:0%
there is no enforcement division there's
no

00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
there's nothing within the department of
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
administrative services that i know of
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to have some sort
 
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.350 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to have some sort
of

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh mechanism for protecting the workers
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner necopolis is from the
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
insurance department and i believe he
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
was referring to
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
his department not d.a.s
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
i think i think the job protection would
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
be equivalent to fmli
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
protection um that would be existing
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
just the same as any other um
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
a violation of fair medical leave
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
protection for those employees over 50
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
that currently exists so if
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
we're adding here a state provision that
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
says for
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
employers over 20 uh if they took
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
adverse action because someone
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
took the benefit of this coverage that
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
a state-based claim for a violation of
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
the family medical leave protection that
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
would not be administrative services
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
that would be a
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner representative
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
walls what i might just add to that
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
the reference to das is that das is the
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
administrator of this program
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to the state so the das
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
would be charged with
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
soliciting uh proposals for this and
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
then administering the program i think
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's where the reference to
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
administrative services came from
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
they do administer other state employee
 
00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.470 align:start position:0%
they do administer other state employee
benefits

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
yes follow up man i'm sure i just wanted
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
to be clear i want to check with
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner nicolapolis and so what
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting is is if there's a
 
00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:02.070 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting is is if there's a
problem

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
that there is an a mechanism to enforce
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
fmla within the insurance department
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative law of
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative walls no
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
that that that would be uh it'd be a uh
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
i believe an eeoc claim initially and
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
then it would be a lawsuit for a
 
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.110 align:start position:0%
then it would be a lawsuit for a
violation

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
violation
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
just like any employer would access uh
 
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.549 align:start position:0%
just like any employer would access uh
access

00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
but but if it's a state plan and you're
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
talking 20 to 50 you have another
 
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.590 align:start position:0%
talking 20 to 50 you have another
follow-up

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
i do thank you does the eeoc have
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction on a state plan with 20 to
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
50 employees or where would that person
 
00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.430 align:start position:0%
50 employees or where would that person
turn

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
turn
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
that it did so that's they would be um
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
eeoc is the first step and then
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
ultimately the courts if
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
if they don't take it up would be
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
enforcing our state law the protection
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh that's where they would get that uh
 
00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:56.950 align:start position:0%
uh that's where they would get that uh
authority

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner representative
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
hatch do you have another question
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
i i do i apologize madam sheriff if i
 
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.149 align:start position:0%
i i do i apologize madam sheriff if i
may

00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
um if somebody's disciplined or
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
dismissed for participating in this
 
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.029 align:start position:0%
dismissed for participating in this
program

00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure i understand
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
that representative leachman's answer
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
was questioned to retaliate against now
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
the scenario is the people are paid the
 
00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:25.110 align:start position:0%
the scenario is the people are paid the
benefit

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
but the employer dismisses because they
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
have taken the benefit
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
and wants to either replace him or
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
whatever or feels that the
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
employee is being unjust and asking for
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
the benefit um
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's the protection that i'm i'm
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
wondering about
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
and what is your question representative
 
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.470 align:start position:0%
and what is your question representative
hatch

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
hatch
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
where is the protection for the person
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's not fraud if the
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
person's paid the family leave okay why
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
don't we let them go through the
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
sections we haven't we're still
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
kind of going through definitions i
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
think that's a good question let's go
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
through the sections we don't know that
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
yet we don't know what's in the plan at
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
all thank you madam chair and i
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
apologize for
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh jumping in thank you and i think some
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
of the confusion might be that
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
protection is being used in two
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
different senses
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh throughout this conversation but
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
let's let's go through starting the
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
topic page 31.
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
okay we're going gonna go through the
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
plan section by section
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
and then when we get done we'll know
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
whether we answered any of those
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
questions or not once we really
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
understand what's in here
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you matt are you doing that now
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
yes so i i will take the lead on this
 
00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:29.430 align:start position:0%
yes so i i will take the lead on this
and

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
punt to dj uh where necessary but
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
lines four through 22 the policy and
 
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.549 align:start position:0%
lines four through 22 the policy and
purpose

00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
that's what i tried to articulate to
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
begin this morning's testimony
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's fairly straightforward what we're
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish here
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
through 12 on to the next page
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
are the definitions you see the
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
instances of when leave from work is
 
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.389 align:start position:0%
instances of when leave from work is
covered

00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
dj previously spoke to those you also
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
see definitions
 
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
for serious health condition as covered
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
by the federal
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
i guess any questions on those first two
 
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.750 align:start position:0%
i guess any questions on those first two
sections

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
specific questions on these two pages
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
represent walls
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
oh man i sure i just hadn't taken my
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
hand out i'm still trying
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay how the eeoc is going to enforce
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
state law because i don't okay we're
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
turn the page to 33 please all right i
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
would just continue in the bottom half
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
of page 32 if i might
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 32 i rushed sorry
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
line 13 contracting administrative
 
00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:48.230 align:start position:0%
line 13 contracting administrative
authority

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
this directs the commissioner of
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
administrative services to solicit
 
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.750 align:start position:0%
administrative services to solicit
information

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
for an rfp you see that section
 
00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.669 align:start position:0%
for an rfp you see that section
continues

00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
continues
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the coverage that we've
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
previously defined
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
for those different categories
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
and matt i assume this language for the
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
contract and administrative authority is
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
consistent with the other language we
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
have given the das commissioner
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the other state benefits that he
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
does for us
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
yes this would be something that they
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
they've done in
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
other instances and and would be
 
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.870 align:start position:0%
other instances and and would be
familiar

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
familiar
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
on the top of page 33 and dj already
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
covered this as well
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
it is a 60 of the average weekly wage
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
with a maximum duration of six weeks per
 
00:30:35.919 --> 00:30:37.750 align:start position:0%
with a maximum duration of six weeks per
year

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh subparagraph c
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
caps the amount of the benefit at the
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
which i believe is 133 000 or they're
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
about so
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
there is an upper bound to what this
 
00:30:54.399 --> 00:30:55.430 align:start position:0%
there is an upper bound to what this
benefit

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh lines six through 16
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
discuss the uh initial
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh phase-in if you will for employees
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
right so a 10-year requirement
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of months of work before
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're eligible
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
and then similarly a waiting period
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
which shall not be required element of
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
now on line 17 and through the next page
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
this talks about the
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
public employees to leverage that for
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
private employees rights the the theory
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
of change here is that we will use the
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
state workforce that 10
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
000 person pool to help buy
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
down premiums in the private market that
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
we have a critical mass
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
that will make this coverage affordable
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
not only for the state
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
but also for those private employers and
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
that want to take advantage of this
 
00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:03.269 align:start position:0%
that want to take advantage of this
benefit

00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
you see the terms on line 32 33 and 34
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
that discuss a seven month wait waiting
 
00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:10.710 align:start position:0%
that discuss a seven month wait waiting
period

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
a one-week elimination period and a
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
60-day annual open enrollment period
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
and that premium shall not exceed five
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
on to page 34
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
you have the conditions for private
 
00:32:30.399 --> 00:32:31.430 align:start position:0%
you have the conditions for private
employers

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
to establish a voluntary coverage
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
that non-state employers may choose to
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
provide fmli
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
at no cost to their employees or on a
 
00:32:42.159 --> 00:32:43.190 align:start position:0%
at no cost to their employees or on a
contributory

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
contributory
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
or partially contributory basis again
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
this is what dj had discussed
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
that the private sector employers have
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility on how they would want to
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
extend this benefit
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
from there you see lines 11

process
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
and how the state would go about
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
selecting a private vendor to administer
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
this for state employees

administrative services to modify
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
the initial benefit structure is within

his authority under this
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
and then on line 32 you see that the

fmli

to help resolve problems of the

procurement eligibility benefit design

through 18 discuss outreach initiatives
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
to continue
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh evangelizing the benefits of this
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
program and encouraging more private
 
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.870 align:start position:0%
program and encouraging more private
employers

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
to take advantage there's a reporting
 
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.669 align:start position:0%
to take advantage there's a reporting
requirement

00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
and also working in coordination with
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
the department of employment security
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i'll develop and implement that
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
outreach program that i was just
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
what is what do you see is the purpose
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
for the outreach
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately the larger this pool becomes
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
both in the private
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
and public sector the lower the premiums
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
will become
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
which is a benefit not only to the state
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
because the state is committing to
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
provide this coverage
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
but also to employees and their
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
employers in the private market
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh dj i don't know if there's anything
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
more on that point you'd like to add
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think you've summarized it perfectly
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
matt it's the
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
basics of risk pool 101 it's the same
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
principles that the state uses in
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
promoting the individual market
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
and you've summarized it very well the
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
the more people you have in that risk
 
00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:01.670 align:start position:0%
the more people you have in that risk
pool

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
pool
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
the lower your premiums will be well
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
while we have the mic i just wanted to
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh clarify the answer regarding where
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
they would uh
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
where they would file a claim regarding
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
a violation
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
of the 20 employee limit
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
i verify with a lawyer who does this
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
work just a second ago
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
and provided that we don't change the
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination in 354 a an employee
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
would not be required to go to eeoc
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
first they could they would be uh
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
eligible to
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
immediately file a superior court
 
00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:38.950 align:start position:0%
immediately file a superior court
lawsuit

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
for a violation of this protection
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
and it would be a state law based
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh claim and it would be a fast uh
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
access to the superior court
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner i think
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative leishman has a question
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
on some of the pages we're going over
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
represent bleechman
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes i i do thanks madam chair but just a
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
comment for the commissioner i guess i'm
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
concerned that someone would be forced
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
to go to a superior court because
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
as you being a lawyer yourself know the
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
expense and sometimes
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
the delay that that would cause and
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
somebody in a situation that was
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh looking for this type of coverage
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
they have to file an action with
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
would seem somewhat onerous at least to
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
me but i do have a question matt
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
and staying as the chairs urged us to
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh by page this advisory board would
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
anybody be compensated those nine
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
members you're proposing
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
would there be compensation for them i
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
believe the only compensation
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
for that board would be legislative
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
mileage for the members of the
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislature that participate
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
what i would just go back to on your
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
how someone would bring a claim to state
 
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.910 align:start position:0%
how someone would bring a claim to state
court

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
i would just like to stress that the
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
scenario in which
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
the question is going down assumes that
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
an employer
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
who is opting to provide a voluntary
 
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.589 align:start position:0%
who is opting to provide a voluntary
benefit

00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
to their employees right because we're
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
not mandating this coverage
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
this is a voluntary opt-in basis
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
why would an employer opt-in to this
 
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.829 align:start position:0%
why would an employer opt-in to this
program

00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
only then to renege on that new benefit
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
they've established for their employees
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
i understand that that might happen
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
but i think you're concerned to be much
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
more warranted
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
if we were mandating this on small
 
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.349 align:start position:0%
if we were mandating this on small
businesses

00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
and that just simply isn't the approach
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're taking here
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
if i could respond madam chair i think
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
you're probably missing my point that
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
the employer is collecting the five
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
dollars a week and for whatever reason
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
he keeps that money or
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get credited appropriate
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
that's my concern the protection
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's voluntary or mandatory
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any bearing it's
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that payment is
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
credited appropriately and the employer
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
using the money for some other purpose
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
even though it'd be a small amount but
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
if they had 20 employees and they're all
 
00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:02.470 align:start position:0%
if they had 20 employees and they're all
participating

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
participating
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
in time if the employer wasn't making
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
sure those payments were forthcoming
 
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.670 align:start position:0%
sure those payments were forthcoming
then

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
obviously the employee could be heard
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
and that's where i'm going and i
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
understand that concern
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
but again this would be something that
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
they would have to opt into
 
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
and those existing avenues would exist
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
for for something in that scenario
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's any more onerous
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
than if an employer was withholding
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
wages or not meeting
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
other existing guidelines under laws
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
under state or federal law
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
thanks manager okay please continue if
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh from there we're on page 35
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
you see the rule making authority in
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
line 26.
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
on line 28 is the appropriation and
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
funding transfer
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
this essentially is an accounting
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism for the administrative
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
services department to fund those costs
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
which are then further delineated on
 
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.190 align:start position:0%
which are then further delineated on
line

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
31 sets a request for proposals to be
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
issued no later than september 30th
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
2021 we believe this gives das
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
sufficient time once the budget is
 
00:39:12.839 --> 00:39:13.990 align:start position:0%
sufficient time once the budget is
enacted

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
to proceed and issue a timely rfp
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
with the intent that this program is up
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
and running for state employees
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
by july 1st of 2022
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
that of course is the start of the next
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
right the second half of the biennium um
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
there is surely an opportunity to
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
accelerate that timeline depending on
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
how the rfp
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
process goes but the intent is that this
 
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.510 align:start position:0%
process goes but the intent is that this
benefit

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
is in place for state employees within
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
so madam chair as long as we're talking
 
00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:48.150 align:start position:0%
so madam chair as long as we're talking
about

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
the funds and appropriations and
 
00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.270 align:start position:0%
the funds and appropriations and
transfers

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
transfers
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
a number of the bills matt we've seen on
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
this have had a
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
fixed figure i think of anywhere between
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
2.6 and more million dollars of general
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
funds to get started what are you
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
proposing as far as
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned general fund transfer
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
how much are you looking to transfer to
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
get this up and running general funds
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
so what i would say ultimately is that
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be dictated based on the
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
rate that the state solicits during that
 
00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.150 align:start position:0%
rate that the state solicits during that
rfp

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
rfp
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
process that rate depending on private
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
market adoption
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
will continue to be driven down but to
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
walk through an absolute
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario where we're at that
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
five dollar threshold cap
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
if you look at the 10 000 state
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
employees give or take
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
times 52 weeks a year it's at most a two
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar hit
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
and that assumes this program does not
 
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.150 align:start position:0%
and that assumes this program does not
become

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
as successful and widely adopted in the
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
private market
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
but we think that given a healthy and
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
robust adoption
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
this becomes a de minimis benefit in
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
terms of costs to the state
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
and you'll notice that the funds from
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
the insurance premium tax which we'll
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
cover on page 36
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
are specifically allocated for that
 
00:41:09.119 --> 00:41:10.390 align:start position:0%
are specifically allocated for that
purpose

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
so again we don't see this as a cost
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
driver for the state by any means
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
because even
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
the way we've structured this program is
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
that the more successful it gets and as
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
time goes on
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
the cost to the state will continue to
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
decrease so you're proposing
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
and we're just getting into line 35
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
section 70 and flipping the page that is
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
you're telling us that is non-general
 
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.910 align:start position:0%
you're telling us that is non-general
funds

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes and that is the new language there
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
in subparagraph
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
c premiums written and authorized by the
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
are deposited into this premium
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
stabilization fund
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
which we'll cover here in the purchasing
 
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
which we'll cover here in the purchasing
pool

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
pool
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
we don't usually transfer funds to an
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
agency to write
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
an rfp so if i can go back to
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
um i mean representative leishman and i
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
were thinking the same thing but he was
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
a few lines ahead of me i'm going to go
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
back to lines 31 33.
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
we don't usually do that i don't see
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
that we would need that das
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
rights rf rfps for
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
our medical coverage for our retiree
 
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.309 align:start position:0%
our medical coverage for our retiree
health

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
for a whole variety of things cyber
 
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.829 align:start position:0%
for a whole variety of things cyber
security

00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
all kinds of insurance any insurance the
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
state has this is
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
they have a whole unit that does this so
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we need those lines because
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
fund them to do that
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
i i would just point out i think these
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
are different sections of the law so one
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
is detailing the program startup and
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
lines 31-34 that you were just
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
referencing yeah but it says
 
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
i must admit i think you're looking at
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
lines 28 to 23
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
30 you're correct i named the wrong
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
lines thank you matt
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then that would just be those those
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
startup costs for implementation right
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
they are that's why i'm saying das is
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
funded to do those things now
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that's tied to the rfp
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
issuance but i i would defer to
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
dj if he has a more specific answer or
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're happy to report back
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
in the alternative dj lines 28 to 30
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
what's the cost
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
yeah let me as matt said let me dig into
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
that further and let me make sure i'm
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
getting you the correct number
 
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay can you get that to me this
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon i can
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
we're only meeting until noon but then
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
we have to be
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
all day at the uh public hearing but i
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
will have a chance to check my emails
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
as we go along so i'd appreciate that
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you sir and we'll bring
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
all that consolidated together into one
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay matt please continue i'm sorry i
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
made you go back a page but
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
no worries on page 36 you see the
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
new chapter chapter 282 dash b
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
the purchasing pool for a family of
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
medical leave insurance
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
this is a new section of the law so
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
again you'll see the
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
existing purpose the same definitions
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we've already reviewed
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
those are restated here
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
in an identical manner that brings us to
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
page 37
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
employer and employee rights and
 
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.430 align:start position:0%
employer and employee rights and
responsibilities

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i think this is where most of our
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
conversation this morning is already
 
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.030 align:start position:0%
conversation this morning is already
headed

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
headed
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
to and i'll also spend a little bit of
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
time on this section so roman one
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
individuals who are employed by private
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
employers that do not
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
either family medical leave insurance
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
under this program
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
or a similar benefit with at least
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
equivalent coverage
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to purchase that
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
coverage through the individual pool
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
right so this creates a mechanism that
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not your employer
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
opts in whether they are based on size
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh or just any other reason those
 
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.349 align:start position:0%
uh or just any other reason those
employees

00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
are not caught out in the cold they have
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
to buy in through an individual market
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
that brings us to pay
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
29 and 30 the
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
end of line 28 the individual pool shall
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
operate by payroll deduction
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
a small business who opts not
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
but has two or three employees who
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
decide to join
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
and may or may not join the same program
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
for family leave because there is more
 
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.270 align:start position:0%
for family leave because there is more
than

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
i think i know of three family leave
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
programs already operating in state
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
we've talked
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
about this before we've been talking
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
about family leave for years
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
you're requiring the little business
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
to make payroll deductions i mean a
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
little business doesn't make payroll
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
deductions for my car insurance
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't i pay that on my own
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
and i can help with that if you'd if
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
you'd like so the thought process
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative ober at the time was that
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
because these businesses
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
have the infrastructure in the systems
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
to collect
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
a variety of of taxes and
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
fees on behalf of their employees that
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
this could simply be slid into that same
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure now that being said
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of different ways
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
that you could approach this potentially
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to put the onus
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
on the individual in a business of a
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
certain size or less
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
to pay the premium directly to the
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
insurer you could certainly
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
do that but this has been a topic of
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
conversation in the past
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
and for simplicity where the
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
conversation had landed at least as of
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
was that because as i said there is some
 
00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:09.670 align:start position:0%
was that because as i said there is some
familiarity

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
familiarity
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the business to collect and
 
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.750 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the business to collect and
remit

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
remit
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh things both to the state and federal
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
government that
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
this would not be an overly burdensome
 
00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:20.390 align:start position:0%
this would not be an overly burdensome
ask

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
well small businesses disagree with you
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
dj i suspect
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
there is probably some varying opinion
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am yeah
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
a great deal of it i'm just bringing
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
that to your attention representative
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
i think you're muted oh you took your
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
hand down okay
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
oh i i took my hand down uh i was muted
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll get i'll get i'll
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
understand this eventually
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay please remember
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
no i i don't care i have my question oh
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
you do have a question
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative no i apologize
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
the onus is on me just back to this
 
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.549 align:start position:0%
the onus is on me just back to this
employers

00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
employers
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh having the deduction i never had more
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
than 24 employees
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
this is not like you said dj this does
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't be overly
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
overly cumbersome for me but i do have
 
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.069 align:start position:0%
overly cumbersome for me but i do have
concerns

00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
um and i need to understand this better
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe there's a quick answer
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
i see that the most a individual can be
 
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:19.990 align:start position:0%
i see that the most a individual can be
charged

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
charged
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
is five dollars so if i have 24
 
00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.190 align:start position:0%
is five dollars so if i have 24
employees

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
their uh premium is five dollars per
 
00:48:26.319 --> 00:48:27.190 align:start position:0%
their uh premium is five dollars per
employee

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
i deduct that and i have my own
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
insurance but
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
i don't see anywhere in this bill that
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow insurance companies
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
to charge more than five dollars uh
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
per individuals and who's liable for
 
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.470 align:start position:0%
per individuals and who's liable for
that

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh additional amount as an employer i
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
can only
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
deduct five dollars from them for this
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
program as a state
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
the same thing but nothing here
 
00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:53.910 align:start position:0%
the same thing but nothing here
indicates

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
indicates
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
if the cost per individual is more than
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
five dollars per week and who pays the
 
00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.910 align:start position:0%
five dollars per week and who pays the
difference

00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
the employee care would i have to as an
 
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.549 align:start position:0%
the employee care would i have to as an
employer

00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
matt are you getting to that i
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
understand his question
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
yes well i apologize uh but i'm sure if
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
that wasn't an appropriate
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
question no that's an appropriate
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
question matt's looking through paper so
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
i think he's going to answer not dj
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
so this is on and dj please chime in as
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
well this is on page 33
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
lion 35 page 33
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
line 35 in response to represent
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
hatchet's question
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
which specifically deals with the
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
individual pool
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
which is related to what we're talking
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
about here
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
premiums for individual pool coverage
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
shall not exceed five dollars per
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
subscriber per week so
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of who makes up the
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
difference we set
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
a statutory cap on what that premium
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
and again we see that only as a worst
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
case scenario
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
where because we're leveraging the state
 
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.510 align:start position:0%
where because we're leveraging the state
workforce

00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
to contract with a vendor to provide
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
that benefit for 10
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
000 state employees and then allow the
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
private market to supplement that
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to buy down
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
those premiums
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
at more and more competitive rates so
 
00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:12.950 align:start position:0%
at more and more competitive rates so
matt

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
matt
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
let me tell you about a mistake i made
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
when i drafted the drug court
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
legislation years ago
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there are any mistakes
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative ober oh yeah
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
there was a an oversight if you will
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
and representative leishman was with me
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
when we did that
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
we had trouble getting that legislation
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
passed we did get the legislation passed
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
but we didn't give any thought to what
 
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
six years later seven years later eight
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
years later
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
when the cost of living has gone up and
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
the amount we authorized
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
really had no adjustment factor for
 
00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.109 align:start position:0%
really had no adjustment factor for
inflation

00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
you have the same situation here five
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
dollars per week today
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
will not be the same as five dollars per
 
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:03.750 align:start position:0%
will not be the same as five dollars per
week

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
in eight years nine years how do we
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
adjust that and that's a concern i have
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
that you're going to get back to me on
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
because i don't expect you to have that
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
answer now but you're going to give it
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
some thought process
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
i i'm happy to provide additional
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
thought okay also say there are two
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
schools of thought about legislation
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
one is that it should take and act the
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
general court to
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
raise any dollar threshold period
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
others will index something to inflation
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
this bill would requ as written would
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
require the general court
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
to take an affirmative vote to change
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
that threshold
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh but i believe we would be amenable to
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
scaling it with inflation but that is a
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
i would say a policy determination for
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
the general court on how much authority
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
they would like to have on that cash
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay so representative hatcher's
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
question was which i don't think we've
 
00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.910 align:start position:0%
question was which i don't think we've
asked

00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
what happens if it's more does the
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
employer have to eat the difference
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
was that your did i restate your
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
question accurately
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
very well thank you madam chair and not
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
just the employer as well as the state
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
i think um i might be able to answer
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
this and i think representative hatch is
 
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:14.630 align:start position:0%
this and i think representative hatch is
right

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
that the cap in the pool is to ensure
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
that the individual premiums paid by an
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
individual employee who decides to opt
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
in alone
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
is capped at five dollars this this lane
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
this bill in front of us
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
does not cap either the state's portion
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
or employers who opt in on their own
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
to that same five dollar cap so
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner you're pointing out the
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
line which we haven't really looked at
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
which is line 27 above that which is the
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
start of the paragraph that say
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
individuals who work for employers who
 
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:49.829 align:start position:0%
individuals who work for employers who
choose

00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
choose
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
not to offer fmla so you're saying this
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
applies to just that small group yeah
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
right and so it is it is
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
possible though i think a lot of work
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
has gone into to make sure that
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
these these these estimates are right it
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
is possible that
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh the state portion could be 5 and 25
 
00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:12.950 align:start position:0%
uh the state portion could be 5 and 25
cents

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
cents
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
and uh the uh and when you factor in the
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
stabilization money to ensure that
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
individuals can get in
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh this bill does not yet or does not
 
00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:22.630 align:start position:0%
uh this bill does not yet or does not
include

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
a cap on what those kind of free market
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
charges will be
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
um there's a benefit design here um
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
that will allow companies to bid i
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
competitively bid
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
on on this product um the number could
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
you know it could the situation could be
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
after we put this out to bid
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
that the five dollar cap is immaterial
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
because all the numbers are under that
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
okay but if we can focus on
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative hatcher's question
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
his question is he's a small business
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
owner running a business with 24 people
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
what happens if it goes up does he have
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
to eat it your answer
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
is if he has chosen to join
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
as a company this section does not apply
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
to him per se because it only applies to
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
companies where the business has
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
chosen not to join as a company is that
 
00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.190 align:start position:0%
chosen not to join as a company is that
correct

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just to separate the two
 
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.230 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just to separate the two
potential

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh possibilities that were kind of
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
interwoven there okay but i'd like a yes
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
or no answer is that a yes or no answer
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
to represent patch's question
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
and he's not in his head yes as well
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
i'm going to give you two yes and no's
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
to the two scenarios that we talked
 
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:32.549 align:start position:0%
to the two scenarios that we talked
about

00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
one uh if if representative hatch's
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
company opted to provide this coverage
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
to all its employees
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh and it was uh six we'll just say six
 
00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:41.589 align:start position:0%
uh and it was uh six we'll just say six
dollars

00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
a week um he and his employees as a
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
benefit design he could decide whether
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
the company's paying for that or uh he's
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
sharing with the employees
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
and in that case that would be a
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
business decision that he makes
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
he could say we're going to opt in and
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
allow all the employees to join
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the benefit costs six dollars and
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
the company's not paying for it
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh and employees could opt to be in or
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
not so bill you could pay
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
all the money you could pay none of the
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
money and employees could pay
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
the six dollars so there's your answer
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
to your question
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
as a company and then the second answer
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
is if
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh if representative hatch opted not to
 
00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:22.069 align:start position:0%
uh if representative hatch opted not to
participate

00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
and two of his employees opted to to
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
join through the individual market
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
those employees would be guaranteed
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
a premium under five dollars five
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
dollars would be the cap
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh and even if that coverage cost six
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
dollars because of the risk pool created
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
under this bill the risk pool would pay
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
the difference
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
but it does not go back to
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative hatch's company
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
as a small company 100
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative hatch i think we
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
finally answered your question
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
represent walls thank you madam chair
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
so i have a question here
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
let's say that we're collecting what
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
page and what line are you on please
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh it's a more broad question just
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
listen to my question you'll understand
 
00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.309 align:start position:0%
listen to my question you'll understand
please

00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
and that is say that it it um
 
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
we're collecting five dollars per
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
employee and it turns out that
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
people are really taking advantage of
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
this and the the cost
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
to the state is closer to six or seven
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
dollars per employee
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
that is not what the bill says
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative walls that's what we've
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
just been going through
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
this line for five dollars per week
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
page 33 line 27
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
through line 35 is for individuals
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
who work for employers who choose
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
not to offer fmli it is capped at five
 
00:56:48.319 --> 00:56:49.109 align:start position:0%
not to offer fmli it is capped at five
dollars

00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
there is a line in here that we've
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
looked at on another page
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
that says employers may pay all
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
may pay none or may prorate with their
 
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.190 align:start position:0%
may pay none or may prorate with their
employees

00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
so we're not saying that a company that
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
joins is capped at five dollars matt is
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct as written madam
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
chair you misunderstand where i'm trying
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
to go with my question
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
where i'm trying to go with my question
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
let's just for the moment confine it to
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
the state i mean it obviously the
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions applicable but for the moment
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to say just for the state
 
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.069 align:start position:0%
we're going to say just for the state
employees

00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
let's say the state employees start
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
seriously taking advantage of this we
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
know 60
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
of our state employees over retirement
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
age they are at the age you start having
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
medical issues
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
so they start really taking advantage of
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
this and it ends up
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
costing more than the premium and it
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
ends up costing more than the pool
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
where does the money come from where
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
does the state
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
find the money to do this because it's
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
going to cost
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
more than we are collecting and that's
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
what is the burden on the state not what
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
is the burden on the employer
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
that is a question that is why we are
 
00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.990 align:start position:0%
that is a question that is why we are
using

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
a private insurance company they will do
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
the risk
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
the state is not running its own
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
insurance agency
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's no different from my insurance
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
which comes from
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
a private company yours may come from
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
anthem yours may come from somebody
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
they have given us a cost for the year
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
based on what they see their risk pool
 
00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:21.990 align:start position:0%
based on what they see their risk pool
being

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
is that not correct commissioner it is
 
00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:25.829 align:start position:0%
is that not correct commissioner it is
correct

00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh but but uh representative wall's
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
question is a fair one
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
that uh it is possible that we go out to
 
00:58:32.319 --> 00:58:32.870 align:start position:0%
that uh it is possible that we go out to
bid

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
bid
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
and the best bid twenty is six dollars
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh i think because the design here
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh is such that uh state employees
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
already have
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh some short-term coverage and so the
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
bill that's different for the state
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
employees and for
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
the private employers or for the
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
individuals is
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
that the first person coverage
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
is already covered by another state
 
00:58:59.839 --> 00:59:00.710 align:start position:0%
is already covered by another state
benefit

00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's covered by the state contract
 
00:59:03.359 --> 00:59:04.309 align:start position:0%
that's covered by the state contract
already

00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
that is going to um allow the
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
carriers that are bidding on this to
 
00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.309 align:start position:0%
carriers that are bidding on this to
offset

00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
offset
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
the cost the state's portion of it is
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
actually going to be cheaper to deliver
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
than the group portion or the individual
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
portion um
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
and so and just to build on that
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative walls if you put that
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
cap of five dollars per pay per pay
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
week into a contract for state employees
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
what are the vendors going to do the
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
vendors are going to come in at the cap
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
more than likely because they're going
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
to guard themselves against
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
upward pressure on premiums uh but as
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioners described because
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
state employee benefits uh are far more
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
robust than
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
the average in the private sector that
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
is going to guard from
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh that that sky-high utilization that
 
01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.270 align:start position:0%
uh that that sky-high utilization that
you

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh posited in your scenario so let
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair please
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
yes follow up thank you so let's move
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
then to the private sector that chooses
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
to participate those people with 20 to
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
50 employees
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
the same issue applies to them that you
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
know they're going to be capped
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
am i correct that they are also capped
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
at the 5 or no they can
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
they they may need to charge more is
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying you say
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
no only the only where individuals join
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
because their company
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
did not join only those people have the
 
01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:36.470 align:start position:0%
did not join only those people have the
cap

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
and so if those people join and it costs
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
more than the five dollars
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
and we exhaust the pool where does the
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
well representative walls what i would
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
say is there is a stabilization account
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
that is set up and we haven't quite got
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
there yet in the bill
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
um okay matt so why don't you continue
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
if you think we're going to get to an
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
answer that she's
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
that will answer that question certainly
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh roman 3 discusses employers with
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
fewer than 20 that wish to provide
 
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.670 align:start position:0%
fewer than 20 that wish to provide
coverage

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to purchase that by
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
making remittances to the fund
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
essentially allows smaller companies
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
that want to provide this coverage an
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
avenue to do so
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
to benefit their employees that fund is
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
established on line four
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
of page 38 which is the fmli
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
premium fund established we make
 
01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.829 align:start position:0%
premium fund established we make
remittances

01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
remittances
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
services is instructed to develop
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
student enrollment procedures
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
and it goes through to some of those
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
details there
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
on line 15 the premium stabilization
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
trust fund is established
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
this is the fund that i was just
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
referring to representative walls
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
that will help stabilize the individual
 
01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.750 align:start position:0%
that will help stabilize the individual
pool

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
pool
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
um which is held separately and you see
 
01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.109 align:start position:0%
um which is held separately and you see
that

01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
again is derived from premium taxes
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
imposed on premiums written
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
and authorized by by duly authorized
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
insurance companies for fmli
 
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.870 align:start position:0%
insurance companies for fmli
insurance

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes so nobody has still
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
answered my questions yet
 
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
he's just getting to it let him go line
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
by line through this fund please
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
on page third matt just go line by line
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
through that
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
you said this would answer her question
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
you only got to the header
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
so on page 38 roman 2 which is line 25
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
says that the monies in this fund shall
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
constitute a
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
premium stabilization reserve and shall
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
be used exclusively for the purpose
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
of assuring that the premium charged two
 
01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.630 align:start position:0%
of assuring that the premium charged two
participants

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
participants
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
in the individual pool remain stable
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
from year to year
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
and do not exceed five dollars per
 
01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:08.150 align:start position:0%
and do not exceed five dollars per
subscriber

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
subscriber
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
per week do you believe that is what
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
answers her question i believe that is
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to answer her question
 
01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.069 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to answer her question
with

01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
to say that in the event that the
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
premiums are actually above five dollars
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of who eats the cost
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
we've specifically developed a mechanism
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
to resolve that issue that's based on
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
premiums charged
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
for this type of coverage that will
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
stabilize that
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
over a period of years this is something
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
that dj referred to as similar
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
to how we deal with medicaid expansion
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
right to hold rates
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
more or less constant over time
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
and not have these wild fluctuations
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
based on who chose to take advantage of
 
01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.870 align:start position:0%
based on who chose to take advantage of
benefits

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
or if you see swings and birth patterns
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
or things like that
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
this is designed to smooth that out
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
follow up represent walls
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
thank you and what if the cost exceeds
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
the fund
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
how's the cost exceeded the fund in the
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid expansion that we set up to do
 
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:09.670 align:start position:0%
medicaid expansion that we set up to do
this

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
i would have to defer to to dj or maybe
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
the commissioner okay
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
can somebody from the insurance agency
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
answer that question because
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative walls has a question
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that to the
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
fund question
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
um but the rates that will be
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh assessed on the state and on uh the
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary group participants
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
will be set sufficient to offset
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
um the individual participants who join
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
and the five dollar cap
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
now with like any insurance the beauty
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
of this product
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
is we're asking a company who's in the
 
01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.549 align:start position:0%
is we're asking a company who's in the
business

01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
of using actuaries to determine what
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate rates
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
are to create this product for us and to
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
bid it
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
understanding the framework that we're
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
establishing in this or
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
there are established in this bill
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
in a if a company bids for this and has
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
the product
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
they are they are required to uh to
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
offer it at five dollars for the
 
01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:13.750 align:start position:0%
offer it at five dollars for the
individual

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
and for the members who participate and
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
if in a given year
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
they have good performance or bad
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
performance that's going to impact the
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
following year's
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
rates um but that that's the business of
 
01:05:26.559 --> 01:05:27.270 align:start position:0%
rates um but that that's the business of
insurance

01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
and and the stabilization fund should
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
allow for some flexibility in making
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
sure that the
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
swings are less but i think
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
compared to a option where fmli
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
insurance is provided by the state and
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
all of the downside was going to be on
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
the state which we've seen in previous
 
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.589 align:start position:0%
the state which we've seen in previous
years

01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
this product allows a a business an
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
to do that for us okay representative
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
walls i don't know if that answered your
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
question or not
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up i do please so
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
let me go back to the state employees
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
what if the cost on the state employees
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
even with your
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
short-term disability insurance exceeds
 
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
what we're bringing in in premiums
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
so we're using an rfp process to
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
establish a rate
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
and at that point that would be dictated
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
by the terms of the winning bidders
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
contract with the state right they are
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
they are agreeing to provide a service
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
at a certain cost
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
if their actuaries don't accurately
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
compute the cost
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that's something that would i
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
mean the risk is transferred at that
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
point to the bidder
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
right that you are responding to an rfp
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
to administer a certain program for a
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
certain cost
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
and again i don't know that this is
 
01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.390 align:start position:0%
and again i don't know that this is
something

01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
that that we're trying to get into and i
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
guess the other thing is that
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
this provision isn't all that different
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
this particular provision isn't all that
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
different than senate bill 1
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
which was vetoed two years ago for
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
because it was an income tax
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
but i don't remember these same
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
considerations being
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
raised specifically on sb1 which had a
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
mechanism more or less identical to this
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
well i i was not on that for sp1 but
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
follow okay
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
let's continue like we don't really have
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
time to
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
figure a point do you have a specific
 
01:07:26.799 --> 01:07:27.910 align:start position:0%
figure a point do you have a specific
question

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative leishman what i'm trying
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
to do is if the plan
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
say that the bid comes in say we're
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
charging for state employees five
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
dollars per person
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
i keep telling you that the plan for
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
five dollars a person
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
is very clearly delineated on that page
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
for individuals whose employer
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
employer does not opt to join the plan
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
the state employees the state as an
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
employer is
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
opting they have then per the lines we
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
have read
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
the option to charge the full premium to
 
01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:06.789 align:start position:0%
the option to charge the full premium to
the

01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
employee who may opt out
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
to pay all the premium of to the
 
01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.230 align:start position:0%
to pay all the premium of to the
employee

01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
who may opt out or who to to charge them
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
a parcel premium
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
in addition per the lines we've read
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
if you offer short-term disability which
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
the state does short-term disability
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
takes over before this does so we're not
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
charging the state employees a
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
five dollar cap that is not what the
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill says
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative leishman you have a
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
question thanks man of chair
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
just like to say i do agree with matt on
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
if an insurance company does sign a
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
contract with the state they'll be
 
01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
obligated to meet
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
the terms of that contract so which
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
leads me to my question madam chair
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
when mr bettencourt appeared before us
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
to present the governor's plan about two
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
years ago you said that you had reached
 
01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.550 align:start position:0%
years ago you said that you had reached
out

01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
with a number of requests for
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
information to determine if there was
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
interest by a number of different
 
01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.149 align:start position:0%
interest by a number of different
insurance

01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
carriers to the five dollars and i don't
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
think we ever heard back
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
whether we get favorable comments back
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
because obviously an rfp was never put
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
out but
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
requests for information uh how did that
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
turn out did you have a lot of interest
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
were they supportive of this five dollar
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
proposed premium
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
i thank you representative leishman uh
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
you are correct that
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
um we have relied heavily on a lot of
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
the information that we got back from
 
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:46.950 align:start position:0%
the information that we got back from
that

01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
rfi in terms of
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
interest overall there was a great deal
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
of interest for
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
this type of approach don't quote me on
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
this but i want to say that we got
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
responses back from approximately eight
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
to ten
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
insurers who expressed interest they
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
provided the state with some
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
advice and some feedback a lot of that
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
advice and feedback
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
centered around adverse selection which
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
gave rise to the provisions that i
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
highlighted earlier that addressed that
 
01:10:16.159 --> 01:10:17.270 align:start position:0%
highlighted earlier that addressed that
problem

01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
the question as it pertained to the five
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
dollar per pay period
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
cap or threshold was not raised with the
 
01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.750 align:start position:0%
cap or threshold was not raised with the
insurers

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
insurers
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned before where that came
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
the genesis if you will of that came
 
01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.149 align:start position:0%
the genesis if you will of that came
from

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh advocates of paid family leave who
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
had done research and who had done work
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
and had identified that as the threshold
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
by which you would not become overly
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
burdensome financially for people to
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
access that coverage
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thanks madam chair matt
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
please continue
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
i believe we are on page 38
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
line 25 roman 2. i believe that's what
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
we had just covered
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
yes uh again you see similar language on
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
the reporting and outreach that we've
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
already detailed
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
and again the theory there is that more
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
participants will drive down premiums
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
for everyone
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i would say
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
especially for whoever does
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
win that contract with the state through
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
this rfp
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
they have a first mover advantage that
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful bidders would not have
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
right because now they've already
 
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.510 align:start position:0%
right because now they've already
established

01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
established
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
a large pool and that will help that
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
provider provide lower rates in the
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
private market
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
so there are benefits to dj's point as
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
to ultimately
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
you know being the sole provider of the
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
state under that rfp
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
you see the rule making authority again
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
delineated here
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
the appropriation and funding transfer
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
and again this is for the individual
 
01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.070 align:start position:0%
and again this is for the individual
pool

01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
pool
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
this section here there is one technical
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
correction just to align
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
this january 1st 2022 date with the july
 
01:12:14.719 --> 01:12:15.189 align:start position:0%
this january 1st 2022 date with the july
1st

01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
1st
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
2022 date that i already specifically
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
that started the fiscal year we would
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
want those dates to be
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
aligned and i apologize so what should
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
that july 1
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to bring that as an
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
section 72 of the bill that's page 39
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
line 18
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
discusses discrimination in the
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
workplace and this is
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
specifically what we were talking about
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
with the job protection provisions
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
so if the company opts in and is larger
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
than 20
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
there are job restoration provisions at
 
01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:03.350 align:start position:0%
there are job restoration provisions at
the

01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
end of that period of leave
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
and this here is consistent with the
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
provisions of the federal
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
fmla or federal family medical leave act
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on job
 
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
protection i know the earlier
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
conversation did focus on that quite a
 
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
conversation did focus on that quite a
bit

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
bit
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative bleechman did you ask
 
01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.229 align:start position:0%
representative bleechman did you ask
that

01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
i believe thank you i was just writing
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
down some of my
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts here but i think the
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner of insurance said that he
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
was going to provide us with some kind
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
of protection language yes he did
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
um today later yeah so that
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm looking for okay matt
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
brings us
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
to section 73 at the bottom of this page
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh just again an exception for the this
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
premium fund that we've established here
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
amending an existing rsa by adding a new
 
01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.229 align:start position:0%
amending an existing rsa by adding a new
subparagraph

01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
subparagraph
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
similarly for the premium stabilization
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
which brings us to section 74 which is
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
the last section of this
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
portion of hb2 which details the 50
 
01:14:12.159 --> 01:14:13.270 align:start position:0%
portion of hb2 which details the 50
percent

01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
of premiums can be held against the
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax as
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
credit uh for the taxable period which
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
the premium is paid
 
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
and again we see this as a further
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
incentive for small and mid-sized
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
businesses to reduce their liability
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
while simultaneously providing this
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
benefit to their employees
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the businesses have a wide degree of
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
latitude on how those benefits are paid
 
01:14:36.719 --> 01:14:37.110 align:start position:0%
latitude on how those benefits are paid
for

01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
either by themselves by the employees or
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
in some prorated fashion
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative hatch thank you madam
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
chair and this i mean
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
um probably goes along with some of
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative walsh's questions
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
have you um estimated what the magnitude
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
of that fund will be
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
and um in other words is there do you
 
01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.310 align:start position:0%
and um in other words is there do you
anticipate

01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
after a year 50 participation or uh i
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
mean you just
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
must have some uh performers um
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
made out and i i would just like to get
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
a sense of the size of that
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
fund and what's your anticipation and
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative hatch when you say fund
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the the tax
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
credits that are held or are we talking
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
about the premium stabilization
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
trust medium state stabilization tax
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
credits are
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
that are held in your entirety so you're
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh section 74 line 3 page 40.
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
yes i am thank you matt i
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
so i believe we're conflating two
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
separate things
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
here so there is a premium
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
stabilization trust fund which is funded
 
01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:42.870 align:start position:0%
stabilization trust fund which is funded
based

01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
based
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
on a percentage of the premium insurance
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
tax specific to these types of
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
policies right separately and i
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
would draw a bright red line here
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
businesses that opt in
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
can claim a debt tax credit
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
against their taxable obligation and my
 
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
question first is with that thank you
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
so your question is about the bet tax
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
credit right
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
what the magnitude of that uh will be
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
yes and just to clarify that these
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
monies do not go to the premium
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
stabilization trust fund
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
we did reach out
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
no no worries we did work with dra and i
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
don't know if anyone from dra is on the
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
line to explain their fiscal analysis
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
but ultimately
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
if the cra's on their line would you
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
they did determine that it was
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
indeterminable at this point
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
um it depends on the adoption so we we
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
do not have a specific
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
dollar amount to to cite but dra has
 
01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:46.790 align:start position:0%
dollar amount to to cite but dra has
been

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
part of these conversations and i don't
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
know if um
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
it looks like carolyn lear from dra is
 
01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.950 align:start position:0%
it looks like carolyn lear from dra is
on

01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
carolyn are you an attendee and if so
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
high representative um someone just uh
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
gave me speaking yes yes we i couldn't
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
find you so i thank nancy or mike
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
whoever did that
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
um i don't have uh anything to add matt
 
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
has it exactly right we don't have the
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
data that would be necessary to
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
analyze the potential fiscal impact of
 
01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.350 align:start position:0%
analyze the potential fiscal impact of
this

01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
bet credit because it is entirely
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
related to the uptake rate
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
for the program
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative hatch
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes i do i i we have some people that
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
are pretty good in math
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
so what's your as i mean when you do a
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
urfp there has to be some
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
information as to the potential for
 
01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.390 align:start position:0%
information as to the potential for
participation

01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
participation
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
do you have any of those numbers i
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
probably could carry the cost to the
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
bet well i guess as far as the fiscal
 
01:18:08.159 --> 01:18:09.030 align:start position:0%
bet well i guess as far as the fiscal
impact

01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
given that this program is not
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
operational until the second year of the
 
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.510 align:start position:0%
operational until the second year of the
biennium

01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
you would it would apply to oh i should
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
defer to dra here but the taxable
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
periods for which this
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
would be this credit would be eligible
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
for would only be taxable periods ending
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
on or after july 1st 2024
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
she's muted she's unmuted uh
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
i think you you have that correct um and
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
likely the fiscal impact for tax
 
01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:47.990 align:start position:0%
likely the fiscal impact for tax
purposes

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
would not fall in 2023 at all
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
because i think it's unlikely that a
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
business would modify their estimated
 
01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
business would modify their estimated
tax

01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
payments during the tax year to account
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
for what is probably a very small
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
proportion of their overall liability
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
um so i don't think you would expect to
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
see the impact in 2023 at all
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you and just how many people do
 
01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:11.830 align:start position:0%
um thank you and just how many people do
you

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
expecting uh participating in this or do
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
you have that number
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
the first year and second year
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
i can see if we can work to similar
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
adoption rates
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
um either for for similar programs but
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
again anything that we would provide
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
would be a stab in the dark but what i
 
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
would just say is
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
as more people join this pool the lower
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
the premiums would be so we do expect
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
this to accelerate
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
um the longer that it goes but
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
as far as that initial uptake
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is a very haphazard guess at this
 
01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:56.790 align:start position:0%
that is a very haphazard guess at this
point

01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
matt i do have a couple of questions
 
01:19:58.800 --> 01:19:59.910 align:start position:0%
matt i do have a couple of questions
that

01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you i generated i actually
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
as i indicated have had a lot of
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
comments and some of these came from the
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire retail association who
 
01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.430 align:start position:0%
new hampshire retail association who
actually

01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
indicated they're very excited about
 
01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.870 align:start position:0%
indicated they're very excited about
this

01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
optional opt-in plan one of the
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
if the employer opts in
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
in retail not every employee
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
however i don't know how many retailers
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
pay weekly as opposed to bi-weekly or
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
once a month
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
but should you have a retailer who pays
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
weekly and you have an employee who
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't work in that week
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
but who's opted in aren't there
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
provisions that you are not allowed to
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
double take a weekly price
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
premium out of somebody's pay if they
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
one week they work one week they don't
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know if i'm the best person
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
to speak to this but
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
the benefit is there is 60
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
of their average weekly wage so
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
you i suppose if you're a business in
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
that type of an environment where some
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
employees work
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
in some weeks but not others you would
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
probably want to extend that
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
but okay i'm sorry i didn't work my
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
question well my fault not yours you
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
answered a question i should have asked
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
i didn't um i'm a small
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
retailer i opt but i have more than 20
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
employees so i do
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
opt in but i do charge my employees part
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
of the premium or maybe all the premium
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
but i have employees who don't work
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
every week i pay weekly
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
how do i get that weekly premium
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
deducted i see with this scenario so
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
in this instance the
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
weekly paycheck would be negative
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
is is the concern right that if i make a
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars in one week and i'm
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
charged two dollars for this benefit
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
i don't work the next week i'm charged
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
another two dollars
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
yes in theory i owe you two dollars that
 
01:22:15.199 --> 01:22:15.669 align:start position:0%
yes in theory i owe you two dollars that
uh

01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know that this bill specifically
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
addresses that concern i think we'd be
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
open to clarifying that
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that that is a nascent
 
01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.790 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that that is a nascent
concern

01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
um but i i would defer to someone that's
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
better steeped in employment law than
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
myself though
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay um then someplace in here there's a
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
it refers to equivalent
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
plans being offered by employers and i
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
know there are some employers in my area
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
who are offering family leave already
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
but they opt to offer something like say
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
four weeks at 100 pay not six weeks at
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
60 or whatever is that equivalent how do
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
you define
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
equivalent i would turn that to the
 
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.310 align:start position:0%
equivalent i would turn that to the
department

01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
if if i might well i'd be happy to
 
01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:07.830 align:start position:0%
if if i might well i'd be happy to
return

01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner or dj the equivalent would
 
01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:11.669 align:start position:0%
commissioner or dj the equivalent would
be

01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
at least the same coverage outlined in
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
and so it would have to be at least six
 
01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.110 align:start position:0%
and so it would have to be at least six
weeks

01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
it would have to be both uh first party
 
01:23:22.239 --> 01:23:22.790 align:start position:0%
it would have to be both uh first party
and

01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
second party family coverage uh i think
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
if it
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
exceeded the benefit that would be fine
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know that
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
there's any ability to call it
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
equivalent if it didn't meet the
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
minimums outlined in but if they paid
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
more commissioner
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
than what this plan pays for a shorter
 
01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.390 align:start position:0%
than what this plan pays for a shorter
period

01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't that be equivalent
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
let's say i make a hundred i make a
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a week because i have a
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
very simple mind
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
so in six weeks
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'm going to get 240 dollars
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
60 a week is 60 60 60 60 right
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
360. 360. but four weeks at 100
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
and what i would just say madam chairs
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
if if we could go back to that specific
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
i don't want a big career if we just
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
came out and i got thinking about it
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
yeah no and that's a very good question
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
right because that's something that
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately we want employees to receive
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
the the maximum benefits they can offer
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious how the existing
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
language would interact
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
or where that equivalency provision
 
01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.550 align:start position:0%
or where that equivalency provision
arises

01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
arises
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i thought someplace you
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
said it so maybe it was opening
 
01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:43.350 align:start position:0%
said it so maybe it was opening
statements

01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
statements
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
no no i know it is in the bill i just
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm curious when
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
that matter of equivalency ultimately
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
comes into play
 
01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
i believe it's for the individual pool
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
and if you're an employee you would in
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
that case
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
choose the economic decision to not join
 
01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
the individual pool but continue
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
with your company's plan given that okay
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
so that would be
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
individuals only if my company didn't
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
opt in am i confusing
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
those two i just don't remember what you
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
said it
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
flashed across my brain when somebody
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
said it
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking for that section as well
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to okay in the meantime you
 
01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.550 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to okay in the meantime you
look

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
maybe representative walls has a
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
question that the commissioner can
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
answer or dj
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
why you look for mine representative
 
01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.470 align:start position:0%
why you look for mine representative
walls

01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
walls
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
i have two different areas i want to
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
address both of which deal with money
 
01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.110 align:start position:0%
address both of which deal with money
appropriately

01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
one is if we turn to page 30 we can't
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
okay i'll speak up one or better if we
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
turn to page 35
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
and we go to lines 22
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
22 it says that the department should
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
develop and implement an outreach
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
program to ensure
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
basically that people are made aware of
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
the program that's what that says
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
that presumably is going to cost money
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
my question is where does that money
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
come from
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
das is currently budgeted for that in
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
their insurance and risk department
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
they do outreaches on all of the
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
employee benefits now including retiree
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
health which has a worldwide
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
impact so that is part of the duties we
 
01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:22.310 align:start position:0%
impact so that is part of the duties we
funded

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
in das and that duty is shared with the
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
department of employment security as
 
01:26:27.199 --> 01:26:28.550 align:start position:0%
department of employment security as
well

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay i just want to make sure the
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
money's there no i
 
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
good question but we did fund it okay
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
my second one actually has to go back to
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums so have we if it's
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
gonna cost about two million dollars
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
what page are we on now please um
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
i don't have the exact page but i'm not
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
sure i need to
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
if the state has to pay for the state
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums for the state
 
01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.990 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums for the state
employees

01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
do have we budgeted that money
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
is there a statement in here that says
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
the state must pay for all the insurance
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
premiums for this probe
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
program so i believe das would be
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
working on a fiscal note but ultimately
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
that fiscal impact is indeterminable
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
based on the rate the state will solicit
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
during that rfp
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
we calculate and giving that that five
 
01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:20.870 align:start position:0%
we calculate and giving that that five
dollar

01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
number that that's specified in the bill
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
right if that's the intent to solicit
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
below five dollars
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
per subscriber per week the maximum
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
impact to the state
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
would be two million dollars and we
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
suspect that it will be below that
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
and continue to fall as more private
 
01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.510 align:start position:0%
and continue to fall as more private
sector

01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
sector
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
companies uh go through that adoption
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
so it's an indeterminable amount but it
 
01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:43.669 align:start position:0%
so it's an indeterminable amount but it
is

01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
no more based on what we've laid out
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
than two million dollars
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up represent walls yes where does
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
that two million come from where is that
 
01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.910 align:start position:0%
that two million come from where is that
budgeted

01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
so that would need to be accounted for
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
from das implementing this program and
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
as we always do with salary and benefits
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
we do see lapses throughout the year
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
so that would have been factored into
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
our more conservative
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
than previously estimated lapse figures
 
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
that are contained
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
in the governor's executive budget
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
summary and that is because this
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
is indeterminable only the second year
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's correct so this benefit would
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
only be for the second year the biennium
 
01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
and as always we see lapses out of class
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
10 class 11
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
class 60 and as a result that
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
would be accounted for through lapses so
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
you took
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
a more aggressive lapse when you did
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
your budget
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
a less aggressive lapse a less
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
aggressive lapse so you're
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
allocating because you took a less
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
aggressive lapse if i get this my head
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
around this again i have a simple head
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
you took a less aggressive lapse so
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
there would actually be
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
a bigger lapse and you're expecting that
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
that could cover
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
the second year of the insurance did i
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
hear that correctly
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
you did hear that correct representative
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
in turning to the governor's executive
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
budget summary if you look at the
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
surplus statement
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
like i can find that with all these
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
papers now matt i mean have fun
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
hello on page 16 you see
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended lapses of 92
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
million in fy 23.
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
you see that fiscal 21 were projected
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
for 150 million
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
you see in fiscal 19 that our lapses
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
were 147 million
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
so this is a conservative budget that's
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
built intentionally
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
um and we're more than comfortable uh
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
with the lapse figures even when
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
accounting for this additional benefit
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
do you know how many state employees we
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
have met i believe we have roughly 10
 
01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:47.830 align:start position:0%
have met i believe we have roughly 10
000

01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
hired and i think 11 000 and change
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
authorized positions oh we've been
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
grab reserve walls i'm sure i presume
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to develop the
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
state pool um and
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out where that
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
money is okay what page you're on now
 
01:30:08.639 --> 01:30:09.750 align:start position:0%
money is okay what page you're on now
please

01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
um well let me go back to the pool here
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
hang on
 
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
i i you know i'm having a hard time
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
wherever the state pool is here yeah me
 
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
too that's why i was asking you the page
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
number we're flipping through a lot of
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
pages matt do you know the page
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
number for that uh i don't i i i can
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
it is a little cold for a swim today
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
not the trust fund but a pool mary beth
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
line 39 page i'm sorry page 39 line
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
page 39 line 12 to 14
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
12 to 14. this is a funding transfer and
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
then below
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
on 15 to 17 the implementation of the
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
individual pool
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
so are you talking about the individual
 
01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.070 align:start position:0%
so are you talking about the individual
pool

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
pool
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to figure out so it
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
could be so 15 to 17 man
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
yeah 39
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
39 lines 15 to
 
01:31:29.679 --> 01:31:32.950 align:start position:0%
39 lines 15 to
17.

01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
so that would be the individual pool for
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
employees whose employers do not
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
and the question is where does the money
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
come from
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
i think i might be able to answer that
 
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
matt um there
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be any money to
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
administer that pool
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
the insurance carrier who's opting to
 
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
provide this coverage
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
is doing that as a individual insurance
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
obligation to those
 
01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:04.149 align:start position:0%
obligation to those
members

01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
and so it's the pool are the folks that
 
01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:07.350 align:start position:0%
and so it's the pool are the folks that
are

01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
opting to be in individually um
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
and and so i don't the state's not going
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
to be administering that
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you but
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
mandatory says the state treasurer shall
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
transfer funds
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
that is or go ahead no that's a that's
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
another line above that's not related to
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
that's 2282 b colon8
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
we are talking about the pool in 282 b
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
okay well let me go back to colon eight
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
where does the money come from
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
this would be the general fund impact
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
for the state to provide the benefit to
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
the employees this is a provision that
 
01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.030 align:start position:0%
the employees this is a provision that
allows

01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
allows
 
01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
the treasurer to transfer money to das
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
for this purpose
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
employment testified that was 15
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner i can never say his last
 
01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.550 align:start position:0%
commissioner i can never say his last
name

01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
name
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
nicholas yeah perfect
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
another good greek yes we did have that
 
01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.470 align:start position:0%
another good greek yes we did have that
testimony

01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
they were by the way favorably um
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
leaning towards this yes and we've had
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
extensive conversations with
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh both uh the commissioner and deputy
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner at flavors
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
yes they were both on with us last week
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair follow up repeat
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
so i you know i agree the administration
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
is small but the implementation that
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
could be three million dollars initially
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
and 1.6 million a year by the numbers
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
that i've come up with
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
and that's where i'm asking where that
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
we don't know where you're getting three
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars and we're using a
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
we're not doing it in-house it is not a
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
state insurance
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's not a state-run insurance program
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
we are going to partner with the private
 
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:06.790 align:start position:0%
we are going to partner with the private
sector

01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
sector
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
and a well-established insurance company
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
that does this for a living
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
so am i to understand that there's no
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
hit to the general fund on the cost of
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
this program
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
except for potent an indeterminate cost
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
for the part that employs to the state
 
01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.830 align:start position:0%
for the part that employs to the state
employees

01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
so the cost would be to provide the
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
benefit to the extent in which state
 
01:34:27.679 --> 01:34:28.390 align:start position:0%
benefit to the extent in which state
employees

01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
take it and again that is something that
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
will be dictated based on the contract
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
of the rfp
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
and then the amount the state
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
chooses to contribute to that as opposed
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
to asking the
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
employees to pay which we could pay
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
so the the envision here is that it's
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
benefit provided to
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
the state workforce by the state as
 
01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:51.350 align:start position:0%
the state workforce by the state as
written

01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
so private in private employers have the
 
01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:55.030 align:start position:0%
so private in private employers have the
option

01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
to pay or prorate and we're going to put
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
state employers in it
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
state employees and yes the state would
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
cover their state employees thank you
 
01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:04.070 align:start position:0%
cover their state employees thank you
matt

01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
matt
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up follow up
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
so those numbers came from the fiscal
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
note on the family medical leave from
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
two years ago because that's what the
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
actuarial people
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
projected that was actually the fiscal
 
01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:17.669 align:start position:0%
projected that was actually the fiscal
note

01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
note
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
two years ago was something close to
 
01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:22.070 align:start position:0%
two years ago was something close to
hiring

01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
42 new employees over at department of
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
employment security
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
plus programmers to write the software
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
for the state to run an insurance
 
01:35:35.119 --> 01:35:36.070 align:start position:0%
for the state to run an insurance
program

01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
we are not running an insurance program
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
we are partnering it out 43 million was
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
43 employed
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative leishman says i misquoted
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
the either the amount or the number of
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
employees we were going to hire
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
so that fiscal note doesn't apply
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
because it's a different thing that had
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
the state doing
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
everything this has the state using a
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
private insurance company
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay well it was also in the governor's
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill 730 last year
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the fiscal note for
 
01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the fiscal note for
that

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:06.130 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:06.130 --> 01:36:07.990 align:start position:0%
that
[Music]

01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
i would defer to dj on that if i might i
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't in this role two years ago i
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to review that
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
specific well
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
number one i haven't looked at this plan
 
01:36:17.679 --> 01:36:18.470 align:start position:0%
number one i haven't looked at this plan
vis-a-vis

01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
the two years ago one specifically i
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
um i don't know as how they are exactly
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
the same we're dealing with this plan
 
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
and we're asking questions on this plan
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
please but i'm also talking about the
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
governor's plan this was the second one
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
i'm referring to was 7 30 which is we're
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with this year's governor's plan
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
not whatever was in the building two
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
years ago i did not ask dj and matt to
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
bring a comparison
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
between the two plans to see the changes
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with what's in front of us
 
01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:49.109 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with what's in front of us
only

01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't pass last year's i agree but
 
01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:52.629 align:start position:0%
we didn't pass last year's i agree but
since

01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have a fiscal note that's why i
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
was going back to that trying to pull up
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
some numbers
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
so that was why i referenced that
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have the fiscal note
 
01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:02.149 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have the fiscal note
here

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
and if if it is similar das would be
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
instructed to do a similar fiscal note
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know the status of that but um
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
i i can't speak to that okay
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
madam chair if i could i think you know
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
the impact of this particular plan and i
 
01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:24.709 align:start position:0%
the impact of this particular plan and i
believe

01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
all of us support the program or the
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
concept of the program but
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
i'd certainly like to see a tightening
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
up of the numbers because if you just do
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
the 10 000
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
state employees i think that works out
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
to about 2.6 million dollars
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
as you said we're looking at at least a
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
two million dollar hit
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
to quote you but i'd like to see the
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
numbers tightened up because one of the
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
things the chair may recall
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
in some of the other or one of the other
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
plans it may have been
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
7-12 the
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
proposal was that the general funds
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
would be returned through like a loan
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
process or the loan general funds were
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
loaned to the
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
program and then they'd be returned yes
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
that was part of last year when we were
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
going to run the insurance program
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so if we could at least get a
 
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
better number we're not doing that
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
well and again the maximum impact that
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
we would project
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
would be 10 000 state employees times 52
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
weeks in a year times that five dollar
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
threshold that we've set that would get
 
01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:30.870 align:start position:0%
threshold that we've set that would get
you

01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
at most 2.6 million
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
2.6 and again we fully expect to have an
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
rfp that comes in below that price point
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
that will then be compounded by the
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
private market continuing to
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
broaden that risk pool and again the
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
cost to administer this to the state
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
will decrease as time goes on
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
and as the program is adopted by more
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
private entities
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair thanks matt matt and
 
01:38:58.560 --> 01:38:59.510 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair thanks matt matt and
dj

01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
dj
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
we thank you for being with us and
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
listening to our
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
maybe hundreds of questions
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
representative emerick do you have the
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
last question for the morning
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
hi yes thank you madam chair and i don't
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
know who i'm asking the question of
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
who's going to determine whether a
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
company is bought into this
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
or it's three employees in a company
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
that didn't buy into it
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
but is remitting a check the companies
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
that buy into it are remitting a check
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
the companies that didn't buy into it
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
are remitting a check
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
how are we going to know the difference
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
why do we need to know the difference
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
because if the company didn't buy in the
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
employees can get it for five bucks
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
if they did buy in it could cost them
 
01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.870 align:start position:0%
if they did buy in it could cost them
750.

01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
750.
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll be driven by the um
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
the application at employer or
 
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
individual level
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
so once this program is rolled out a
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
company is going to be opt
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
have the option to opt in for their
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
employees and if they do they'll fill
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
out their paperwork it'll be rated based
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
on on their risk profile
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh or they won't opt in and the
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
employees will have the right to do it
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
um and so it's it's it'll be it'll be
 
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
treated no different than employers who
 
01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:14.310 align:start position:0%
treated no different than employers who
offer

01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
offer
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
other uh benefit uh access to other
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
benefit insurance products
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
you know an aflac is something you might
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
be able to relate that to your employer
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
may offer you access to
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh products and so thank you so i guess
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
the answers are going to ask them
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so representative emerick says that
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
answers the question
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
i think i have a potential resolution to
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
your issue with section
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
one in hb2 that i want to discuss with
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
the group
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
i want to take however a short 10 minute
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
break we have all been sitting
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
in our chairs for two hours
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
so if tracy is going to mute the room i
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
would ask the participants at home
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
to mute and block your screens we'll be
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
back at approximately
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
four minutes before eleven
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody for participating
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
and we are going to be in recess for 10
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
i have one more question we are in
 
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
back matt is still with us
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
matt is a new member of division one
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
um don't tell division two
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
i won't tell division two when we were
 
01:41:42.239 --> 01:41:42.870 align:start position:0%
i won't tell division two when we were
leaving

01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
representative walls had a question
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
represent walls are we live
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
tracy are we represent walls do you
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
still have a question
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
um i actually called commissioner
 
01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:54.870 align:start position:0%
um i actually called commissioner
nicholapolis

01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
nicholapolis
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
on the break and he did address it so
 
01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:58.550 align:start position:0%
on the break and he did address it so
okay

01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that but however there's
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
something going on here where i can it
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
says you cannot start your video because
 
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
the host stopped it
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh nancy and mike are weak yeah it's
 
01:42:14.719 --> 01:42:15.109 align:start position:0%
uh nancy and mike are weak yeah it's
back

01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
somebody okay you're back sorry i didn't
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
do anything it's magical
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh i know but i just thought i'd mention
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
that that um
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah yeah i spent the break on the
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
phone with the commissioner so okay
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
matt we have the rainy day stabilization
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
fund which is
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
yet another of your sections in hb2
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what page you're on and
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
what section it is because we were going
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
to talk about that
 
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
so we're on page 40 this is section 77
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay page 40 section 77 this is lines 20
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
to 25 and this is
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully a much briefer conversation
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
than the last one but i'm happy to
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that may arise
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh the intent here and it's just a
 
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
one-word change
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
that changes the the cap of the revenue
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
stabilization reserve account or the
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
rainy day
 
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
fund to an amount equal to 10 percent
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
of unrestricted general fund revenue
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
over the biennium
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
currently our cap is 10 of a single
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
and the impetus behind this change
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
really does speak to
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
the revenue shortfall we forecasted at
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
the beginning
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
of this pandemic we felt that this cap
 
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
was overly restrictive
 
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
for a type of event that absent what
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
turned out to be a robust
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
recovery uh the state would have been in
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
a very difficult spot
 
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
so this does not automatically require
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
the state to put any additional
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
funds into the rainy day fund but rather
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
allows us
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
to put essentially up to 320 million
 
01:43:57.199 --> 01:43:57.990 align:start position:0%
to put essentially up to 320 million
there

01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
if we ever were to so choose the current
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
statute limits us at roughly 160 million
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
which means we're almost full given that
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
we're at 115 million dollars today
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
why would we want to do this i think the
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
biggest thing
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
to highlight is that when it comes to
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
managing through a crisis
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
the state should have sufficient
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
reserves to
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're able to to steer
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
through it we budget on a biennial basis
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
we think it makes sense to tie the rainy
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
day fund to a biennial basis as well
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
separately this does impact our bond
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
rating and i do have a report from pew
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts that i will share with
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
digitally as well but new hampshire's
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
bond ratings are very strong
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
some of the strongest of any state in
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
the country but what i would say
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
is that and this report does detail it
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's opportunity for the state uh
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
jerry can you get that report
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
and matt do you have it digitally
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
to either quickly zip to
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
michael caine or or michael hoffman or
 
01:45:05.679 --> 01:45:06.470 align:start position:0%
michael caine or or michael hoffman or
nancy

01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
nancy
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
so that the people can see it at home
 
01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:10.470 align:start position:0%
so that the people can see it at home
absolutely

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
i'll send that as soon as we conclude
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
here but essentially that
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a function of what percentage
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
of the rainy day
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
cap is funded but rather how much money
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
the state has this is one copy right
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
this is one copy um i am going to have
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
janet clayman make copies of this for
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
everybody and
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
email and snail mail it out to mary beth
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
and bill we haven't seen it either
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
but we will get electronic copies for i
 
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
mean hard copies for those of us sitting
 
01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:42.229 align:start position:0%
mean hard copies for those of us sitting
here

01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
mary beth and bill you will get a copy
 
01:45:45.669 --> 01:45:45.679 align:start position:0%
of this in the mail
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
afterwards best i can do at the moment
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
and i i can email the link online as
 
01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:54.550 align:start position:0%
and i i can email the link online as
well

01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
yes i just have a quick simple question
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
what does it do to our bond rating does
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
it raise it or lower it how does that i
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
think that's what he's about to tell us
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
and we just don't have copies of them so
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
so the benefit of course is bond ratings
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
are assessed based on how well the state
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
is prepared for an adverse financial
 
01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:16.310 align:start position:0%
is prepared for an adverse financial
impact

01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
anything that the state can do to better
 
01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:19.830 align:start position:0%
anything that the state can do to better
prepare

01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
prepare
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
itself such as putting a higher cap on
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
and allowing us to accrue more money
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
there and if you think back to two years
 
01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:28.709 align:start position:0%
there and if you think back to two years
ago

01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
when we had a such a robust surplus we
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
were trying to find
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
one-time projects to spend it it would
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
have been fortuitous to maybe put
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
a bit more of that into the rainy day
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
fund for the
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
a potential crisis this would simply
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
offer that additional flexibility to the
 
01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:47.430 align:start position:0%
offer that additional flexibility to the
legislature

01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
to put additional money in the rainy day
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
fund it doesn't require anything
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
to go there so your answer is this would
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
strengthen our bond rating in response
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
to represent wallace's question what
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
does it do to our bond rating is that
 
01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.109 align:start position:0%
does it do to our bond rating is that
correct

01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
correct but it would it would it doesn't
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
directly do that because the state would
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
have to actually
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
put money there to see those benefits
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
but allows
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
additional flexibility for the state to
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
do so and if the state were to do that
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
it would likely have a positive impact
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
on follow-up representative walls
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
no i think he just answered my question
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
and that is raising the rating doesn't
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry raising the cap doesn't change
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
the bond rating it's if we fully fund it
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
that changes the bond rating
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
correct and there's not a magic number
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
or a percentage right it's a holistic
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
review of the state's finances
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
but being better prepared for an
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
economic downturn
 
01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
would have some positive impact it may
 
01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
be de minimis given that we're already
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
on the upper end
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
of those ranges compared to other states
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
very strongly rated by all three rating
 
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.030 align:start position:0%
very strongly rated by all three rating
agencies

01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
s p moody's and fitch but again this is
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
just a good management structure that
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
would allow us to steer through a crisis
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
if coven had not rebound or the the
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
large multinational companies that have
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
continued to pay our business taxes
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
predominantly um hadn't rebounded as
 
01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:14.790 align:start position:0%
predominantly um hadn't rebounded as
robustly

01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
robustly
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
as they have okay sure but wouldn't it
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
then lower our borrowing costs
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
if we fund this doesn't it then lowering
 
01:48:22.709 --> 01:48:22.719 align:start position:0%
our borrowing costs for everything we do
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
if our bond rating improved whether for
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
this factor or any other factor
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
as part of a good management of state
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
finances yes that that would have that
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
but i i will say that the returns may be
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
de minimis
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
given that we're already on the upper
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
tier of that range
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you please continue
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
all right deb you said anything
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
everything you want that's all i have
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
again this really just aligns the rainy
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
day fund with our biennial budget is the
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
biggest takeaway representative leachman
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
i only have one question madam chair
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
would you accept a motion to approve
 
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
i would representative leashman
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative leishman moves to approve
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
on the motion to approve section
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
77 the revenue stabilization cap
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
in hb2 if you're in favor of the motion
 
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
when your name is called
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
please say yes if you're opposed please
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
say no represent vembrick is going to
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
call the role for us what we know about
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative burge
 
01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:30.639 align:start position:0%
is he got a second shot yesterday
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
we don't know if he's having a reaction
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
or sleeping or what because
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
he intended to be here we did try to
 
01:49:38.229 --> 01:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
call him
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
we got no response we did text him we've
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
got no response so we're hoping
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
that his second shot has just made him
 
01:49:46.239 --> 01:49:47.030 align:start position:0%
that his second shot has just made him
sleepy

01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
sleepy
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
and he's not had a car accident on his
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
way in or something critical but we've
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
heard nothing bad
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
so we're hoping for the best so
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative emerick when you're
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
ready to call the role
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
okay so far three episode voted yes
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%

yes
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative emerick just turned on
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
his microphone
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
we're slow to be trained but we're
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
learning representative leishman yes
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative hatch yes representative
 
01:50:28.159 --> 01:50:28.870 align:start position:0%
representative hatch yes representative
walls

01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
walls
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
yes man i'm sure the vote is
 
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
six to zero vote is six to zero matt
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming with it we are not
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
doing anything with family leave this
 
01:50:38.639 --> 01:50:39.910 align:start position:0%
doing anything with family leave this
morning

01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
you gave us a lot to think about but it
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
is not something we're going to do at
 
01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
this time
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
i would like to have the committee turn
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
to section
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
all right section 55 is the distribution
 
01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:07.750 align:start position:0%
all right section 55 is the distribution
of

01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals and as you know from
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
previous conversation
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
mrs lavinas researched this
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
extensively and found out
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
how complicated it was and how deep it
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
was this has been in hb2
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
for every i think
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
all the eight years i've done budgets in
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
house finance
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
the final result was mrs lavina's
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
thought and i agree with her
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
we should leave it in it is much too
 
01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:41.109 align:start position:0%
we should leave it in it is much too
complicated

01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
probably requires a policy bill to make
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
a change and i'd like to
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
welcome representative wyler who is
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
going to sit in with us for
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
the rest of the morning it's nice to see
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
you sir and there's a microphone right
 
01:51:54.719 --> 01:51:55.510 align:start position:0%
you sir and there's a microphone right
there

01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:51:59.830 --> 01:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
to turn on we're just about to vote in
 
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
the distribution of rooms and meals tax
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
which is the section that's been in hp2
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
for a number of bienniums and i would
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
move to
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
approve this section section number
 
01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:12.470 align:start position:0%
approve this section section number
please

01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative emerick seconds on the
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
motion to approve section
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
55 in hb2

your hand up and i did not see it
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
on my sincere apologies not necessarily
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
i certainly understand
 
01:53:00.629 --> 01:53:00.639 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to note that um rooms and
 
01:53:00.639 --> 01:53:01.669 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to note that um rooms and
meals

01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
meals
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
um the hospitality industry is vitally
 
01:53:06.629 --> 01:53:06.639 align:start position:0%
important to this state
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes that mechanism to fund
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
um the promotion of that activity um
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
through a portion of the rooms and meals
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
tax um
 
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
was was great and very effective
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
and and i'm just though i voted yes i
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
i had to really contemplate this pretty
 
01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:27.750 align:start position:0%
i had to really contemplate this pretty
hard

01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
hard
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
um and my first inclination was not to
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
vote yes
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
particularly where we're reducing the
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
amount of the wounds and meals tax and i
 
01:53:38.589 --> 01:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
and i just my concern is that it's very
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
counterproductive but
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
in the sense of cooperation i voted yes
 
01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:43.430 align:start position:0%
in the sense of cooperation i voted yes
and

01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can address this in the
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
future and bring it back as soon as
 
01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:47.350 align:start position:0%
future and bring it back as soon as
possible

01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for your
 
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
indulgence okay
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
i i don't think we reduce the amount of
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax
 
01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
this section says the provisions of
 
01:53:58.280 --> 01:53:59.430 align:start position:0%
this section says the provisions of
rsa-12011b

01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%

01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%

01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the division of tribal and tourism
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
development are hereby suspended for the
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
biennium ending
 
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
june 30th 2023 i think the intention was
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
not to reduce but if they got more
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
especially given the pandemic
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
when rooms and meals tax has been lower
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
that they could
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
support that industry and i couldn't
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
agree more with you
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
that that industry is vital to us
 
01:54:27.610 --> 01:54:27.620 align:start position:0%
represent hatch
 
01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:29.910 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair all right we have
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
two amendments and i have to
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
credit the diligence of represent walls
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
to start
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
them could lba bring up on the screen
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
the shea farm amendment for the
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
department of corrections
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
gentlemen madam chair
 
01:54:57.589 --> 01:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
yes given that your amendment apparently
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
is broader than mine would it make sense
 
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
for me to withdraw my amendment
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
and just use yours i got them in two
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
pieces so we could use them both
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
the next one is the second transitional
 
01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:10.950 align:start position:0%
the next one is the second transitional
housing

01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
so yours is only one unit and mine's
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
only one unit is that yes
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
they had already started on yours by the
 
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
time i worked this out with helen
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon so we left it
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
with yours and added mine so you'll see
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
a second amendment very shortly
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
so this this division was
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
all of us a bit distraught about
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
the cuts to department of corrections
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
we've restored
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
vocational training and education this
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
would restore the cuts to transitional
 
01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:48.709 align:start position:0%
would restore the cuts to transitional
housing

01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
shea farm i'd like to thank
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative walls for
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
pushing that this might not have
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
happened had she not done that last
 
01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:56.629 align:start position:0%
happened had she not done that last
thursday

01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
thursday
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
so represent walls might i assume you
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
would move
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
to approve this amendment
 
01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
you most definitely may assume that
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%

i talked to representative berger she
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
was going to make
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
a cut in
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
hb2 that gave us enough money to fund
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
both of these still meet our cut goal
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
and still restore both of these and
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
i actually started working on that
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
friday because of the push by
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
representative walsh
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%

01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
that is given that we just approved my
 
01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.030 align:start position:0%

amendment

01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%

01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%

these work this is a true legitimate
 
01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:31.750 align:start position:0%
these work this is a true legitimate
question

01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
given that i had indicated to do a back
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the budget cut to
 
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:38.480 align:start position:0%

this with
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
a separate cut in hb2 how does that work

with two different funding sources
 
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:47.840 align:start position:0%

01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
from the back of the budget cover from
 
01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:50.070 align:start position:0%

judiciary

01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%

02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
the news last night so i don't know if
 
02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
adam sexton got this on or not but he
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
called me about this and then
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
he called me back on me to do a zoom and
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
when i did the zoom
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
i made it very clear that represent mary
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
beth walls pushed us to look in this
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
direction and that the division
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
and i named all seven members of the
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
division have been working
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
very hard to get the budget done and we
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
were all unanimous about this so i made
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
it very clear this was a team effort
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
and not just my effort and then i was
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
going to watch the news
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
only somebody called me about the
 
02:01:13.109 --> 02:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
training and vocational
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
education in the corrections and by the
 
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
time i got off the phone explaining
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
we had put all that back news was over
 
02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:20.470 align:start position:0%

02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
tracy says he didn't get on madam chair
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%

02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
kind of under cut and surprised by the

02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
take the authority away from the

02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
one at a section with a proration
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
of the money the sheriffs
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
finance have been a
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
burr under our saddle in division one
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
and that burr has gotten bigger
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
with the implementation of felonies
 
02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:02.229 align:start position:0%
with the implementation of felonies
first

02:06:02.229 --> 02:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
it used to be before felonies first
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
that the majority of those arrests
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
went first to district court
 
02:06:15.510 --> 02:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
they were arraigned using
 
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
video arraignment i.e no transportation
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
of prisoners when felony first
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
implemented superior
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
chief court justice nedau
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
did away with video arraignments and now
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
in every county and of course
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
hillsborough where i live and where
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative leishman lives has two
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
courthouses so we have double the effort
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
double the sheriff's involved have to do
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
in-person arraignments
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
lots more transportation
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
since i was digging into things for
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
represent walls on friday i was just
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
kind of in a row
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
what are our other little horses that go
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
out after dark what are the nightmares
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
we've had that we haven't been happy
 
02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:02.629 align:start position:0%
we've had that we haven't been happy
with

02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
and i kept hearing representative hatch
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
and representative taberge's voices
 
02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
in my head about section 1 and hb2
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
so i had nancy dig up the rsa for me
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
surprise to surprise the rsa
 
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
never said the das would pay this
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
so it's always been available for the
 
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
judicial branch to pay
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
surprise surprise the
 
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
rsa does have a statement
 
02:07:40.709 --> 02:07:40.719 align:start position:0%
that says up to the funds allocated
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
so we have a situation that we created
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
one time trying to be good
 
02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
that said we're gonna have das reimburse
 
02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:51.430 align:start position:0%
that said we're gonna have das reimburse
this

02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
and we're gonna have him do it for the
 
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
judicial branch never has any visibility
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
of the funding
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
never has any visibility or idea of the
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
consequences of their requests such as
 
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
cutting off video arraignment
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
and now we have this disconnect and the
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
sheriff's are very unhappy and two of
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
our representatives on this division
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
were very unhappy
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment one which is on the board
 
02:08:20.830 --> 02:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
will move the money into the judicial
 
02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:22.069 align:start position:0%
will move the money into the judicial
branch

02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
branch
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment two that will follow this
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
which mr hoffman said he would share on
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
the screen
 
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
and which none of us have seen yet
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
specifies in the rsa that the judicial
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
branch is
 
02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
responsible for the reimbursement so we
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
don't have this disconnect again
 
02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
and it also specifies that the judicial
 
02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:48.709 align:start position:0%
and it also specifies that the judicial
branch

02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
branch
 
02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
will explore using more technology
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
in order to cut down on some of the
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
transportation costs
 
02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:57.599 align:start position:0%
we could go back to the video
 
02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
arraignment for example
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
in superior court without a doubt all of
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
us have county
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
prisons that are set up with video rooms
 
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
so mr hatch
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
i am getting rid of that horrible
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
amendment you and mr tuberge didn't like
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
i'm putting the funding over there we
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
did not cut the judicial branch at in in
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
any way so and we gave them transfer
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
authority and hb2
 
02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
so we know they will always have funding
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
to 100
 
02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
fund the sheriff's mr hatch your hand is
 
02:09:30.159 --> 02:09:30.870 align:start position:0%
fund the sheriff's mr hatch your hand is
up

02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
just uh just again to uh thank the chair
 
02:09:35.189 --> 02:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
for her
 
02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
very um good and well-intended
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
efforts and um this is a work in
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
progress and again i can't thank you
 
02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:43.030 align:start position:0%
progress and again i can't thank you
enough

02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
for your attention that's all thank you
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
you're welcome i'm going to
 
02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
move to adam joseph weiler
 
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative wyler's hand was up first
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative waltz will be second
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing in the amendment that
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
talks about the rate they're being paid
 
02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:00.639 align:start position:0%
the the hb2 has a second
 
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses paying them
 
02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:04.550 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses paying them
vis-a-vis

02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
the contract and that is in there all
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
the time we have approved that
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
so that rsa at some point needs to be
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
fixed to match what we're doing in hb2
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
but we
 
02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
we have already approved that
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm looking at hb1
 
02:10:22.069 --> 02:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
which is relevant for this purpose
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
because it specifically says
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
the state shall reimburse the sheriff's
 
02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
office for court security
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
so this is not necessarily
 
02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
transportation this is actually court
 
02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
security in the courtroom during the day
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not arguing that we shouldn't
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily put it on the courts but i'm
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
just saying that
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's it in this case it's not about the
 
02:10:42.229 --> 02:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
transportation of the prisoners it's
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
about the security in our courthouses
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's the transportation that has upped
 
02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
the cost that is causing the heartache
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of the video
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
arraignment with felonies first
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
so we always had enough money to cover
 
02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
the courthouse but it also covers the
 
02:10:58.239 --> 02:10:59.430 align:start position:0%
the courthouse but it also covers the
transportation

02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
and the transportation has gone up
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
significantly and i think mr hatch and
 
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
mr tuberge
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
both talked about the extreme distance
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
that you have to drive sometimes in
 
02:11:12.629 --> 02:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
up in the northern counties so that
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
means more hours more half days more
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
full days
 
02:11:19.270 --> 02:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
because they transport the prisoners and
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
then they provide the security if the
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
prisoners are not transported
 
02:11:25.109 --> 02:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
then they do not have people in the
 
02:11:27.669 --> 02:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
rooms to provide security for so it kind
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
of all goes together
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
but we know where the increase came from
 
02:11:32.950 --> 02:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
that we started having the dollar amount
 
02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:33.830 align:start position:0%
that we started having the dollar amount
problem

02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
represent patch chair yes thank you
 
02:11:38.229 --> 02:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair not to belabor this
 
02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
but just that we have requested
 
02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:41.270 align:start position:0%
but just that we have requested
information

02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
from the courts that's forthcoming that
 
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
will give us
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh viable factors to utilize to be fair
 
02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:11:51.189 --> 02:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
other than just population or other
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
things there's a lot of
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
factors involved and i would appreciate
 
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
anybody's input
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
or help in establishing uh viable
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
factors that's all thank you man
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
and i think that's good you can continue
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
to look at that what this does
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
is remove go back to the model where
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
everybody was getting paid 100 percent
 
02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
while you do your investigation instead
 
02:12:12.629 --> 02:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
of shortening
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
shorting some some sheriff's
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
department's money
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
for work they're doing which i agreed
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
with you did not seem fair
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes
 
02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
to be clear just going back to hb2
 
02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's two different provisions one on
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
court security and one on prisoner
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
custody and control would this fully
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
fund both
 
02:12:35.589 --> 02:12:35.599 align:start position:0%
because i've heard from my own sheriff
 
02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
as well as other sheriffs
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
about the fact they can't hire people
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
even at the current rate
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
and taking it down to 80 means they're
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to hire anybody
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make sure we're fully
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
funding both sections
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
the current rate is another section hb2
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
that we've approved
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
that says that they are paid at the same
 
02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:55.750 align:start position:0%
that says that they are paid at the same
rate

02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
rate
 
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
as the negotiated contract
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
and that's an hb2 and we voted that in
 
02:13:01.679 --> 02:13:04.550 align:start position:0%
and that's an hb2 and we voted that in
earlier

02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay i'm just i'm just gonna understand
 
02:13:09.990 --> 02:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna move the amendment to hb1
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative emerick said he would
 
02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:13.030 align:start position:0%
representative emerick said he would
second

02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor of the approval of
 
02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
hb1 when your name is called please say
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
yes if you're opposed please say no
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative over yes i'm a yes
 
02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative griffin yes
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
02:13:30.069 --> 02:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative hatch yes
 
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
representing walls yes i'm sure the
 
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
board is seven to zero
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
vote is seven to zero mike will you
 
02:13:37.510 --> 02:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
share the
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 amendment for this and tell us what
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
the number is
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
will but may i ask a question yeah
 
02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
um i just happened to notice on budget
 
02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
page 76
 
02:13:53.189 --> 02:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
for that sheriff's reimbursement there
 
02:13:54.790 --> 02:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
is a footnote
 
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
so we would uh take the committee's
 
02:13:57.990 --> 02:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
action as
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
also deleting that footnote just please
 
02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:10.069 align:start position:0%
also deleting that footnote just please
absolutely

02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:15.149 --> 02:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
0837h which does
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
what i explained when i gave my
 
02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
explanation about the
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
bundle of hb1 and hp2 together
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
so this tells the judicial branch to
 
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
seek to use the technology
 
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
that is appropriate
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
and it also tells the judicial branch
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
that they will be reimbursing the
 
02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
sheriffs for all of these fundings
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
which seems appropriate because the
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
judicial branch is the one
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
determining how much security they need
 
02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
so again i am going to move to approve
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
amendment 2021 0837h
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
see no discussion representative emerick
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
when you're ready if you're in favor of
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
the motion please say yes
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%

yes representative griffin yes
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative leishman yes
 
02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative walls yes
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
and quarter seven to zero okay
 
02:15:35.910 --> 02:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
the vote is seven to zero we have a
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
couple of budgets that we could move to
 
02:15:38.159 --> 02:15:39.030 align:start position:0%
couple of budgets that we could move to
approve

02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
approve
 
02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch although it falls
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
under us the rsa actually says that
 
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
facilities committee
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
determines it so we could move to
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
approve that
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
we have also had treasury in
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we could move to approve the
 
02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:56.550 align:start position:0%
and we could move to approve the
treasury

02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%

was united
 
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%

last week thank you evans i can't find

02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
what that did was delay the start of the
 
02:25:28.319 --> 02:25:29.590 align:start position:0%
what that did was delay the start of the
hiring

02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
of an unclassified position director of

intergovernmental affairs until january
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
of 2023 but in and of itself it doesn't
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
save any money because the money would
 
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
be transferred from a vacant position
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
um within dbea so this is the peak that
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
makes that
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
um savings if you will uh happen
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%

you here with us
 
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
i try not to whine too much but i think
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
i mentioned at least once a day
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
so twice and we all agree with that in
 
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
case you want to know that
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
thumbs go up around the table when i say
 
02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:16.790 align:start position:0%
thumbs go up around the table when i say
that

02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%

02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:20.710 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a universal wine in this

02:28:21.750 --> 02:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:28:25.270 --> 02:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
um this was they have a lot of vacancies
 
02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
and they've unfunded some people and
 
02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
to me the governor's projected plan he
 
02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
didn't take into account their revenue
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
and he took out two more and we're
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
restoring them
 
02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
does it make money because they make
 
02:28:41.190 --> 02:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
money and we need the three million
 
02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:42.550 align:start position:0%

02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
this is your amendment mary beth that
 
02:31:21.270 --> 02:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
you've been working on with kim
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
merrifield on that uh section 128
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
the language that there was a concern
 
02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:30.150 align:start position:0%
the language that there was a concern
about

02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
so this has your name on it i think you
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%

represent walls is going to speak to her
motion

02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
so this amendment is not exactly the
 
02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
language that i wanted commissioner
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
maryfield came up with language that i
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
thought was better and then ols
 
02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
said you can't do it so i kind of view
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
ols as god in these things and god had
 
02:32:00.479 --> 02:32:01.030 align:start position:0%
ols as god in these things and god had
spoken

02:32:01.030 --> 02:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
spoken
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
so i worked with ols to come up with
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
additional language
 
02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
as you may recall the problem was is
 
02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
that they're stopped
 
02:32:10.630 --> 02:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
sending notices
 
02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
return receipt requested and therefore
 
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
they have no idea if the
 
02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
service has been completed upon people
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
from whom they want to take away
 
02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:19.190 align:start position:0%
from whom they want to take away
benefits

02:32:19.190 --> 02:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:32:21.830 --> 02:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that you should not be
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
taking benefits away unless somebody's
 
02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
been notified
 
02:32:27.349 --> 02:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
so this happens and i wasn't even sure
 
02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
of this when i started this this happens
 
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
to apply to workman's comp and in most
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
cases with workman's comp there's been a
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
decent back and forth
 
02:32:36.469 --> 02:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
but if somebody moves and they for
 
02:32:38.150 --> 02:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
whatever reason don't have a forwarding
 
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
address or don't have a fixed address to
 
02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
have a forwarding address i wanted some
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
time to happen
 
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
so what it says is in you know you can
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
read it but what it basically says
 
02:32:49.910 --> 02:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
is is that if you don't have service you
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
have to do it send a return receipt
 
02:32:53.670 --> 02:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
requested if that doesn't happen
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
it gives the department a year to try
 
02:32:56.710 --> 02:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
and find
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
the claimant and notify them that
 
02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
some sort of problem with their benefits
 
02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
and that during that year they're
 
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to make
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate attempts to contact the
 
02:33:08.469 --> 02:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
claimant and if at the end of the year
 
02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
they can't find the claimant
 
02:33:13.030 --> 02:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
then they can just issue an order
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
of not in favor of the claimant in other
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
words where the claimant loses
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
and it seemed to me that this was a
 
02:33:21.030 --> 02:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise kind of a fair
 
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
compromise of protecting the climate
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
but not leaving a des or
 
02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
in a situation where they've got cases
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%

02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
we are going to delete

the director of operations
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
as a from

from this point i think
 
02:37:55.590 --> 02:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh the answer mike who did this
 
02:37:58.870 --> 02:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
previously we made that person 50
 
02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
and adjusted the salary in doc is that
 
02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:04.550 align:start position:0%
and adjusted the salary in doc is that
correct

02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:06.389 --> 02:38:06.399 align:start position:0%
or did we just delete this person
 
02:38:06.399 --> 02:38:09.670 align:start position:0%
or did we just delete this person
altogether

02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:12.550 --> 02:38:12.560 align:start position:0%

02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:13.270 align:start position:0%

remember

02:38:13.270 --> 02:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
remember
 
02:38:15.990 --> 02:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
this is the brand new position for the
 
02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:16.950 align:start position:0%
this is the brand new position for the
biennium

02:38:16.950 --> 02:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:38:18.550 --> 02:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
they're just going to have to do without
 
02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
him it adds too much cost
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
again yeah
 
02:38:27.990 --> 02:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me um the position please help
 
02:38:31.270 --> 02:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
the position exists as a um
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
executive assistant now and this is the
 
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
name of the position to director of
 
02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:37.830 align:start position:0%

operations
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
and when i looked in the system the
 
02:38:42.070 --> 02:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
salary is very close for the two
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
this would be more of a formal naming of
 
02:38:46.710 --> 02:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
that position
 
02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
actually this did not have
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
a policy review
 
02:38:57.349 --> 02:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
which edna should have done so where
 
02:38:59.670 --> 02:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
they can file a bill next year they can
 
02:39:00.790 --> 02:39:00.800 align:start position:0%

02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
this is this year's
 
02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 686 which came out of ways
 
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
and means
 
02:42:21.349 --> 02:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
with a recommendation of 19 to 2.
 
02:42:24.389 --> 02:42:24.399 align:start position:0%
i understand last biennium it also
 
02:42:26.790 --> 02:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
passed out of ways and means
 
02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
however it got bundled into one of those
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
infamous omnibus
 
02:42:36.630 --> 02:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
bills at the end of the year that did
 
02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:37.030 align:start position:0%
bills at the end of the year that did
not

02:42:37.030 --> 02:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
get past the governor's red pin because
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
of everything in the bills this is
 
02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
a bill this replicates word for word
 
02:42:49.670 --> 02:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
the historic racing bill that ways and
 
02:42:51.429 --> 02:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
means has been working on for i think
 
02:42:51.439 --> 02:42:51.910 align:start position:0%
means has been working on for i think
about

02:42:51.910 --> 02:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:42:55.750 --> 02:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
six years together
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
i have urging from ways and means to
 
02:42:59.120 --> 02:42:59.830 align:start position:0%
i have urging from ways and means to
include

02:42:59.830 --> 02:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
include
 
02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
into the budget it gives us an
 
02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:04.309 align:start position:0%
into the budget it gives us an
additional

02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:43:07.269 --> 02:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
oh yay representative burge is alive in
 
02:43:07.279 --> 02:43:10.630 align:start position:0%
oh yay representative burge is alive in
here

02:43:10.630 --> 02:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
we do have a meeting one o'clock we had
 
02:43:13.830 --> 02:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
a meeting at 10 o'clock we were worried
 
02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
like crazy about you we thought your
 
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
shot had
 
02:43:20.469 --> 02:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
done you win okay we're not that lucky
 
02:43:25.269 --> 02:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
oh oh did i miss something no come down
 
02:43:29.429 --> 02:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
and sit we're going to take one more
 
02:43:29.439 --> 02:43:32.790 align:start position:0%
and sit we're going to take one more
vote

02:43:32.790 --> 02:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
and one o'clock you need we need help at
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
one o'clock too so i'll tell you about
 
02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
it come sit down
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
all right so this
 
02:43:44.150 --> 02:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
puts word for word that bill that's come
 
02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
out of ways and means
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
we get 24 million dollars of revenue
 
02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
that revenue unfortunately does not
 
02:43:54.389 --> 02:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
greatly benefit us
 
02:43:56.710 --> 02:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
it benefits the education fund because
 
02:43:59.110 --> 02:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
it goes into lottery but that's okay
 
02:44:01.990 --> 02:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
anything we do to help education we've
 
02:44:03.910 --> 02:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
heard some of the pleas from some of the
 
02:44:04.950 --> 02:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
other people
 
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
i think we are in favor of that we had a
 
02:44:09.830 --> 02:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill on that that got retained so we
 
02:44:12.150 --> 02:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
know we need to somehow benefit
 
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
so i've been asked to put this in and
 
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to move the
 
02:44:20.710 --> 02:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
adoption of 2021 85h
 
02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative emerick ii madam chair
 
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
yes you happen to hit something that i
 
02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
know a great deal about
 
02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm glad to hear that and i actually
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
think that you
 
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
have misstated what happened in the last
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
two years and i know that because i was
 
02:44:37.830 --> 02:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
on the floor with it
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
both times and the story is that the
 
02:44:42.630 --> 02:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
bills came out of ways and means
 
02:44:45.030 --> 02:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and eventually there was a
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
floor fight of which i led the
 
02:44:48.070 --> 02:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to it
 
02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
and fortunately was successful in both
 
02:44:51.110 --> 02:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
years so
 
02:44:53.429 --> 02:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
in neither year is my understanding did
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
historic racing
 
02:44:57.750 --> 02:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
pass and so i'm not sure what where it
 
02:44:59.670 --> 02:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
might have passed because i can assure
 
02:45:01.030 --> 02:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
you that in the floor fight
 
02:45:04.469 --> 02:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
both times i prevailed so i am
 
02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
only repeating the information i got
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
from ways and means i don't recall this
 
02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:09.590 align:start position:0%
from ways and means i don't recall this
bill

02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
at all however we've been asked to put
 
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
it in by ways and means
 
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
if they gave me some bum information i
 
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
can apologize represent walls but i did
 
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
not research it i would use
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
my colleague's information i understand
 
02:45:25.110 --> 02:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
that but i'm gonna
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
severely oppose this this body
 
02:45:29.429 --> 02:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
legislature does not approve of this and
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
turned it down not just the last two
 
02:45:33.110 --> 02:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
years but
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
every single year before that this is
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
totally contrary to what this
 
02:45:39.190 --> 02:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
legislature has done and it was not a
 
02:45:40.309 --> 02:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
partisan issue
 
02:45:42.309 --> 02:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
it was a bipartisan and when i was on
 
02:45:43.670 --> 02:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
the floor there were republicans
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
standing next to me opposing this as
 
02:45:45.600 --> 02:45:46.389 align:start position:0%
standing next to me opposing this as
well

02:45:46.389 --> 02:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:45:48.070 --> 02:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
so i think that it's really
 
02:45:49.670 --> 02:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to be putting it in when
 
02:45:50.790 --> 02:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
02:45:53.750 --> 02:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
bipartisanly has so consistently opposed
 
02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:54.469 align:start position:0%
bipartisanly has so consistently opposed
this

02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:45:56.469 --> 02:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
i understand the desire for finding more
 
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
revenue but i think this is not an
 
02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to do it
 
02:46:02.070 --> 02:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
i think that there are huge problems
 
02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
with this there's huge problems with the
 
02:46:06.070 --> 02:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
companies being brought in to run it
 
02:46:08.070 --> 02:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that this is being brought
 
02:46:10.150 --> 02:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
in now without a public hearing
 
02:46:12.150 --> 02:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a it had a public
 
02:46:14.790 --> 02:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
hearing it's house bill 686
 
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
it had a public hearing in ways and
 
02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
means this year
 
02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
but i'm also telling you that the floor
 
02:46:23.269 --> 02:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
that the body itself has opposed what
 
02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
the committee has done
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
every single time without exception or
 
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
we would have historic racing
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
and we don't and i think that it's a
 
02:46:31.439 --> 02:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
and we don't and i think that it's a
huge

02:46:31.910 --> 02:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
huge
 
02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
problem to be bringing this in and
 
02:46:36.150 --> 02:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
burying it here in hb2 this is
 
02:46:37.910 --> 02:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
let's just let it go through or be
 
02:46:39.269 --> 02:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
debated as a bill
 
02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
and not try and circumvent the regular
 
02:46:44.070 --> 02:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
bill process on such an important change
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
to our laws
 
02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments i was asked
 
02:46:49.510 --> 02:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
by the speaker and republican leadership
 
02:46:51.349 --> 02:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
to bring this forward it has passed out
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
of ways and means
 
02:46:55.590 --> 02:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
with a 19 to 2 recommendation it has had
 
02:46:57.510 --> 02:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
a public hearing
 
02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your comments this is where
 
02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
the motion the amendment has been moved
 
02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
