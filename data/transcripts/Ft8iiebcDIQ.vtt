00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
um we thought that would be the best way
 
00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
to go about doing things vers someone
 
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
sitting behind bars and um we are a
 
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
society that truly know that
 
00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
um jail is not really a
 
00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
deterrent but um if there's someone that
 
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think I think somewhere in here
 
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't it talks about you know
 
00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 align:start position:0%
subsequent offenses we wouldn't expect
 
00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
someone that's going to continue to do
 
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
the same thing over over again to be
 
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
afforded this opportunity this is more
 
00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity for um someone that hasn't
 
00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 align:start position:0%
offended um over and over again or
 
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
whatever and that allow them to be with
 
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
their caretakers because there's a
 
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
disruption all around in terms of
 
00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
whether it's your children or someone
 
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
that you're caring for so that's the
 
00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 align:start position:0%
Ence up
 
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
it thank you any uh
 
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
members of the public that want to
 
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
speak oh I'm sorry representative that's
 
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
um I I I have very mixed feelings about
 
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
this bill I in theory I think it's a
 
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
great idea um I absolutely believe that
 
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
we should be doing whatever we can to um
 
00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 align:start position:0%
minimize incarceration um you know we
 
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
for all the reasons that we know there
 
00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
there are challenges around that um my
 
00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
concern um as a former employee of the
 
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
state's child protection system um are
 
00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
around um that Aces not only involve
 
00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
violent crimes but there are other
 
00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
impacts to Children um and this this
 
00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
this well vulnerable um populations
 
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
maybe the disabled Community um that I
 
00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
don't know that are necessarily
 
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
protected by this um one of the the
 
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
um things that I noticed I don't think
 
00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about Primary Care
 
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
Giver um you know we're not talking
 
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
about sometimes you know a custody I
 
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
mean I don't think that's necessarily
 
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
addressed here U whether or not that
 
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
person has custody um
 
00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
and I don't know I I feel like it needs
 
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
a little work um and I and I don't know
 
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
um given the input that we that we had
 
00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
from some of the um the stakeholders it
 
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
it it specifically at least as it stands
 
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
right now I understand it doesn't
 
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
address if the vulnerable person is the
 
00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
victim um and that my understanding also
 
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 align:start position:0%
um uh the judicial system already has
 
00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
the ability to um impose lesser
 
00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
sentences and I and I having worked in
 
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
the system and with some parents that
 
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know were struggling with substance
 
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
abuse challenges I absolutely um agree a
 
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
um somebody testified that even though
 
00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
they have the ability sometimes there's
 
00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
bias and I I wholeheartedly acknowledge
 
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
that and I think that's a reality um
 
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
but you know I'm not I'd be interested
 
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
in seeing if there are things that we
 
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
could do to address those concerns uh
 
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
because as as as is um it I don't know
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
that I think we have to be conscious of
 
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
balancing the rights and the protections
 
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
and the well-being of the vulnerable um
 
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
disabled and children with do doing the
 
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
right thing for uh for parents who who
 
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
who need
 
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
help thank you so there was a Senate
 
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
Bill last year I believe SP 254 that is
 
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
similar to some of this bill almost
 
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
verbatim I think uh the new bill
 
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
obviously there was quite a bit added to
 
00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
it probably to maybe answer some of the
 
00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 align:start position:0%
concerns the senate had with it it was
 
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
killed in the Senate um my opinion is it
 
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
it may have made it worse course I think
 
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
there are some things in it that might
 
00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
be confusing it might actually open the
 
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
door for judges
 
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
revictimized to make it workable for
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
where all parties are are happy with it
 
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.870 align:start position:0%
where all parties are are happy with it
but

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
uh I'm willing to listen to any other
 
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
any testimony about if anyone from the
 
00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 align:start position:0%
public wants to speak on what your
 
00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:33.749 align:start position:0%
public wants to speak on what your
concerns

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
were I may have a question for attorney
 
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
Enders um just so I can refresh my
 
00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
memory on something you may have
 
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
time and and I don't I I agree that the
 
00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 align:start position:0%
bill has some has some Merit I just
 
00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:51.950 align:start position:0%
bill has some has some Merit I just
think

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
uh it's it needs a lot of work and I
 
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
think it's going to cause more damage
 
00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
than it is good um so I guess a question
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
I have is was it this bill that you
 
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
spoke that the nine the nine County
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
attorneys and there you were all on
 
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
board with it is this was it this bill I
 
00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 align:start position:0%
no okay that's what I wanted to clarify
 
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 align:start position:0%
okay so any anything that you you tell
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
us or you told us in testimony was was
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
yours no I would indicate that again in
 
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire everyone obtains an
 
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.909 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire everyone obtains an
individualized

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
individualized
 
00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.749 align:start position:0%
individualized
sentence

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I would draw the
 
00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
attention to is RSA 6514 B and that that
 
00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 align:start position:0%
statute is entitled PR sentence
 
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
investigation of members of and Veterans
 
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
of the Armed Forces it essentially says
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
when a defendant appears in court and is
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
convicted of a crime the court shall
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
inquire whether the defendant is
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
currently serving in or is a veteran of
 
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
the Armed Forces and then it goes on to
 
00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 align:start position:0%
say if the defendant is currently
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
serving in the armed forces or is a
 
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
veteran and has been diagnosed with
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
having a mental illness by a qualified
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist the court May and it goes
 
00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
on but essentially says consider the
 
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
treatment recommendations of any
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
diagnosing or treating mental health
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
professionals together with the
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
treatment options available to the
 
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
defendant in imposing sentence and I
 
00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
think that's the gist of what this bill
 
00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
wants to accomplish for
 
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
caregivers not necessarily
 
00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
veterans and I I think almost less words
 
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
might be more in the sense of saying um
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
the court can take into consider
 
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
consideration an individual status as a
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
caregiver prior to imposing
 
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.629 align:start position:0%
caregiver prior to imposing
sentence

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
um and again I think the court can do
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
that now but I think maybe making it
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
more explicit would be uh what what the
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
drafters are looking for and at least to
 
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
let the court know that and
 
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
again everyone in New Hampshire gets
 
00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
gets an individualized sentence and it
 
00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome anybody to come over
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
to Superior Court and watch sentencing
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's their public hearings and you can
 
00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
certainly see what the court talks about
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
and goes through when making those uh
 
00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
sentencing decisions okay so would it be
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
your opinion
 
00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:14.879 align:start position:0%
that what this bill is trying to
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
accomplish is already being done or can
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
be done with the existing legislation I
 
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
I I would say it's already being done on
 
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis that I I know certainly
 
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
as a prosecutor negotiating sentences
 
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
with defense counsel
 
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
if someone is a parent or a caregiver
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
that's almost always brought to my
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
attention that because defense is using
 
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
that as a mitigating factor to say
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
please don't send this person to jail
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
because they have kids they have a job
 
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
they have an apartment they have you
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
know people they're taking care of
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
whether that argument wins the day or
 
00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
not is is a separate issue certainly
 
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
it's something that is taken into
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
consideration and in your opinion is
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
that basically the essence of this bill
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
is just allowing I guess a judge in this
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
case to consider those things not
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily rule that
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
way that's how I read this bill um there
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
is a list of
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
specific treatment or options in a to J
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
of what the judge can potentially
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
impose really a lot of those options are
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
available in every case to the extent
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
they're available at all and I say to
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
the extent they're available at all in
 
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
the sense of um I think it's difficult
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
to find some of these programs because
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
they're not statun they're not funded
 
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
programs okay you had a question
 
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
about uh constitutionality I guess of
 
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
sentencing without knowing what the S
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
sentence is going to be that vagueness
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
yes I I had those concerns with respect
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
to paragraph three I think there's a way
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
it can be done that's constitutional
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
and and I don't want to be misunderstood
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
that I think there this is a complete
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
dead end I think it just needs a little
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
tweak with the wording essentially that
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
the court can
 
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
um you know suspend sentences require
 
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
people to appear for future review
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
hearings and um Can impose the sentence
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
at those
 
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
hearings thank you anyone have questions
 
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
hearings thank you anyone have questions
representative

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah my question is I agree that
 
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
this this bill has Merit but I also
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
think that there are too many lists I
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
think they try to they try to cover
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
everything and um when you get a list
 
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
invariably you leave something out and
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
then they try to define or it appears
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
that that the SP the bill is trying to
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
Define what a judge can and cannot do so
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
now you've put handcuffs on the judge
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
and you may not have put in things that
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
that he should be able to do but can't
 
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
do because now they're confined to
 
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
whatever is in the list so I would have
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
difficulty supporting the current
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
wording of this bill well and I don't if
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
you have a comment on that thank you and
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
just to to follow up on that I also one
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that we have difficulty
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
with is you'll have a judge who will
 
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
look at this and say well it says I can
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
provide drug and alcohol treatment for a
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
person who's a caregiver and they may
 
00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:28.519 align:start position:0%
interpret that to mean I can't provide
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
drug and alcoh call treatment to a
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
person who's not a caregiver because it
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
it it's not
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
explicitly given to them so I I do think
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
you run a you know
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
well representative uh hary thank you um
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
yeah the carv outs was one of the the
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
issues that I had um concerns about just
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
you know in an attempt to to make ensure
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
that certain things were left out I I
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
just worry that some that may be equally
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
important are not considered um I
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
actually I really like the idea of this
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
bill and I agree that it has has great
 
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
Merit um you know when I when I was
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony and you know
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
reading the specifics um of the language
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
to me this is a a bill that is such a
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
great reminder to us of um we need to
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
invest we need to to fund programs um so
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
that we allow um the court
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
to have options I mean it's one thing to
 
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
say yeah we want to send somebody to
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
whatever treatment um and but if there's
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
no spots to put that person in um we're
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
doing a disservice to to the individual
 
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
um we're not meeting the family's needs
 
00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
um we're not you know then the the
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
consideration of the impact of Aces on
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
um the children of incarcerated parents
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
aren't really being weighted properly so
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
I think this is just a real lightning
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
kind of call to say hey we've got to
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
fund programs to give the you know the
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary options um and you know
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
and you know address things like the the
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
all the precursors to to the challenges
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
that that you these individuals are
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
winding up on whether it's mental health
 
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
substance abuse um and you know we want
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
to you know the in a number of
 
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
situations just in my history with the
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%
division I was the nurse I wasn't a
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
child protection a service worker but
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
you know the children that we're talking
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
about very often had um adverse
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences unrelated to the
 
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
the criminal um issues that we're
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
addressing here um and and we need to be
 
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
able to do something about that too so
 
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
it's a huge issue I I like the idea I
 
00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:53.079 align:start position:0%
like the intent um I'm just you know if
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
the thought is that the ability to to
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
for the um the court system to already
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
do this um exists then we don't re need
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
to you know Rel legislate that but I you
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
know I would certainly love it if we
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
could um you know training for judges as
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
to you know hey please make this your
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
first consideration and then whatever um
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
and you know use this you know this this
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
goal U as a way to drive forward you
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
know options for you know I mean it me
 
00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:28.519 align:start position:0%
so many meet needs it meets the needs of
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
the children meets the needs of the
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
parents it meets the needs of the courts
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
the you know the prisons and so um I
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
don't know this just some my
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:07.990 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
for I'm Paul howon County attorney from
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
Mari County um I'd like to elaborate on
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
a couple things attorney endress
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh in no particular order pres
 
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.310 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh in no particular order pres
sentence

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
investigations many people don't know
 
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
but I was a defense attorney before I
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
became a prosecutor back in the early
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
2000s and they routinely did PR sentence
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
investigations on felony offenses back
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the early part of the 2000s uh they
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
were quite helpful uh at times because
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
they delve into issues such as those
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
raised within this statute probably
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
close to I'm going to bet about 10 years
 
00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
ago or so um the PSIs uh started getting
 
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
used less and less and less and less to
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
the point now where I think they the the
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
virtual uh uh the Rarity uh is a prenten
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
investigation although it's still
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
allowed by statute uh and I think that's
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
an important tool but along those lines
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the the Department of
 
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
Corrections um is at the same Staffing
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%

by funding and we're lucky in Marat
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
County we have a pretty robust system uh
 
00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
for that within the House of Corrections
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
here but again those only address
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
bden I hope I understand correctly that
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
the format in a subcommittee is that I
 
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need to be asking
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
questions of witnesses and that this is
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
a conversation between the committee
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
members um on that
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
note um when we were working on this
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
language which we did spend quite some
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
time on um I was under the impression
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
and I think other stakeholders were
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
under the impression that the Tennessee
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
language that we modeled this on was
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
complex and I distinctly remember
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
looking it up reading it working to
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
model our language off of that but make
 
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
it more appropriate
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
realistic and um so I went to look that
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
up in preparation for this hearing and
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
realized that somehow it became
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
one one sentence and that sentence that
 
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
was added to Tennessee law and I'm not
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
sure when this happened I don't know if
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
they passed that complex version because
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to use their website
 
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily but it just says available
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
community- based alternatives to
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
confinement and the benefits that
 
00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
imposing such Alternatives May provide
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
to the community should be considered
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
when the offense is nonviolent and the
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
defendant is the primary caregiver of a
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
dependent child and I think they were
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
saying um that it's probably too
 
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
specific should be more broad um I do
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
think that as a general role broad is
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
better than specific I I definitely
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
worked with the stakeholders to make it
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
less specific than they were asking um
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
but I you know I don't I'm just sharing
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
that I I feel like that could be an
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
alternative version of this bill but I
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
was also thinking of just handing
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
I asked um our committee researcher to
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
give us all copies of this but instead
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
he put one copy in my folder in my
 
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
filing cabinet that I haven't looked at
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
in like a year so I just realized it was
 
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
in there but if I gave this to you maybe
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
you could consider how you how you think
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
it fits into the mold of of how things
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
now and I think this details into what I
 
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
had said earlier with reference to 6514
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
B with with reference to Veterans is
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
broader maybe better just to say um the
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
court can certainly take into
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
consideration whether or not a person is
 
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
uh the primary caregiver of a dependent
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
offense and that should be in an
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
inclusive list not an exclusive list um
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know um to allow that to be an
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
inclusive list among other factors that
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
a court ought to consider not an
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
exclusive list of
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
one thank you and again I just come back
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
to this question of if it's
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
already the policy and it's already in
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
law and it's already being done what's
 
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
the point of making another law just to
 
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.710 align:start position:0%
the point of making another law just to
reinforce

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
reinforce
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
that I guess that's my question
 
00:19:52.919 --> 00:19:55.710 align:start position:0%
that I guess that's my question
representative

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
Balden I think that there may be a
 
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.950 align:start position:0%
Balden I think that there may be a
practical

00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
practical
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
but I'm not an attorney so maybe they
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
have a different perspective but I think
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
there may be a practical difference
 
00:20:04.919 --> 00:20:06.669 align:start position:0%
there may be a practical difference
between

00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
um directives that a judge is aware they
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
should be considering during um you know
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
the Jus the criminal justice process
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
versus an argument that an a hired
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
attorney available only to certain
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
people with certain funds would know
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
that they could successfully make based
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
on their experience in work their
 
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the judge their knowledge
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
of case history I think that
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
that's you know what I'm saying I feel
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
like that's the difference is that if we
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
make it clear that this is acceptable
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps it would be considered more
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
frequently um and applied to the folks
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to Target which are
 
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
the folks that while under the law
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
should be facing
 
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
incarceration aren't a threat to the
 
00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
public and have dependence who would be
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
incarceration but I think it was
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
testified to that it's already in law
 
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
that this is to be considered that way
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
so we'll be making a new law just
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
to reiterate what another law says am I
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
Am I
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
Wrong there's nothing currently
 
00:21:18.269 --> 00:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
explicitly in the law saying that the
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
court has to consider whether a person
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
is a a a uh caregiver for a dependent
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
child but certainly the court can
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
consider that under current law and I
 
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
think would consider that under current
 
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
law if it was brought to the Court's
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
attention and and just to follow up we
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
had talked about people facing
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
incarceration at least in New Hampshire
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
the Constitution um guarantees everyone
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
who's facing potential incarceration the
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
right to an attorney so if they can't
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
afford one they'll be appointed one by
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
the new through the New Hampshire public
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
defender office um and as I'm sure
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
you're aware the New Hampshire public
 
00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
defender office is the the largest law
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
firm in the state of New Hampshire and
 
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
it has very talented dedicated attorneys
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
working there I've worked with some of
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
them representative will did you want to
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
speak on this Bill
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman I just wanted to say
 
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
that uh I definitely respect all the you
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
know there's some Nuance that needs to
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
be met here when it comes to this bill
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
but I do just think based on the fact
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
that this isn't currently in law that
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that respect that the
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
judges are probably good people and a
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
lot of them probably do take this into
 
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
account especially in Marram County just
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
because we got this guy here right now
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
but I do think that there's a concern
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
that exists from people that have gone
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
through the court system right now that
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
some of those judges because of not any
 
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
necessar we can get into the biases in
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
another place but because of uh the
 
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
history that people have are sort of
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
just getting these cases and then
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
sending them through with without
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
consideration and I think having
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
something in law that makes sure that
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
there is that consideration that the
 
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
judge says to themselves okay I have to
 
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
listen to RSA 6 whatever whatever
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
whatever because I have to make sure
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
that there's uh due consideration here
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
for somebody who might be a primary G
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
caregiver or something like that for
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
someone else so that that would be the
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
only thing that I have to say to
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
B thanks again um in response to the um
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
note that was made about the right to an
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
attorney I think it's worth taking into
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
consideration that in um there are many
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
cases I would say a large majority of
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
cases that never go to trial there's a
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
plea deal and um I I'm sure that if we
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
could obtain any statistics on the
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
reasoning used in um accepting a plea
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
deal that's offered that the ability um
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
like that the impact of the length of
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
incarceration on their lives or the
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
lives of dependence would be a factor
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
for the person deciding whether or not
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
to accept a plea deal like if I take
 
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
this to court I'm going to be in jail
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
pre-trial for God knows how long I could
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
lose my kids but my mom can take them
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
for three months if I just do three
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
months and I plea this out and that's
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
the kind of situation that comes to mind
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about making sure
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
that judges whether they're reviewing uh
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
what kind of sentence to apply in
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
something that went to trial
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
where someone had an attorney whether
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
they paid or whether it was a um a
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
public defender but as well as
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
situations where someone's taking a plea
 
00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
deal they're going to end up in a in
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
front of a judge regardless the judge is
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
going to ask them do you understand um
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
what you're playing to Etc and so in
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
those situations where someone might be
 
00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
especially because someone who's taking
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
something to trial is either I would
 
00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:53.559 align:start position:0%
imagine extremely confident of their
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
innocence or um is moneyed in a
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
situation you know to the extent that
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
they're able to challenge that and I'm
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
not talking about people that are
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
innocent I'm talking about people with
 
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
this bill that are guilty that are under
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
the law deserving of incarceration and
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
that um so the odds that they're going
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
to end up obtaining a public defender
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
and taking it to trial I think are
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
incredibly small for the group of people
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
that are targeted by this legislation
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
and so the idea is that when they go
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
through that sentencing process for a
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
flag to pop up and say to the
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
judge the legislature which has
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
authorized the courts to exist agrees
 
00:25:36.029 --> 00:25:36.039 align:start position:0%
and supports the judge if they want to
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
um assess some kind of sentence that
 
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve incarceration because of
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
the outlays of the people affected by
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
that person being incarcerated um you
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
know because like I in that example my
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
mom can take the kids for three months
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
but that's it um those types of
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
situations I think there should be a
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
conversation it should be taken into
 
00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
consideration we don't want kids going
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
through the system we don't want kids
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
with trauma that are going to end up
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
being repeat offenders when they're
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
adults we don't want more people on um
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
relying upon government benefits that
 
00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
are necessary and um you know it just
 
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
seems like a fiscally responsible choice
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
that if a judge definitely agrees that
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
someone can be reformed without
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
incarceration that we go that route
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
because there's just massive expenses
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
around incarceration not just to house
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
and feed someone who's being
 
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.110 align:start position:0%
and feed someone who's being
incarcerated

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
incarcerated
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
but then to deal with the people that
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
they're no longer able to care for so if
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
if there are people in this state who
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
are guilty of crimes and who can be
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
reformed without incarceration we should
 
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
be looking at that regardless of however
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
we get there I'm cool with that um but I
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
feel like this paragraph um in Tennessee
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
law might seal the
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
deal representative Stone thank you as a
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
individual not a member of this
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee I'd like to State individual
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
Stone individual Stone
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say that I would assume in
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
my experience which was 25 years roughly
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh most judges understand Judiciary
 
00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
discretion when it comes to sentencing
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
and most of these cases are pled out and
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
they are represented by Attorneys at
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
both the misdemeanor and felony level
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
and a good majority I would say what
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
probably 95% or more are plea deals
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
versus actual trials and the
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
representation from the public defenders
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
or a private attorney operates in the
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
best interest of the client to bring
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
these mitigating circumstances to the
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
table when it does come to incarceration
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh I think the sentencing guidelines do
 
00:27:35.389 --> 00:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
exist for a reason and I just I just
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
can't imagine a judge uh going off the
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
reservation as you will to say that uh I
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
I have seen judges refuse to accept plea
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
deals but it's very very seldom in my
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
experience I don't know if attorney
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
henders could elaborate on that but very
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
rarely I think you do see judges that
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
are just flat out re receive the uh plea
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
deal between both
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
parties point out thank you let me point
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
out within
 
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
6512 in the annotated statute there's a
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
foot there's a section of footnotes
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
under section four it talks about the
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
discretion of the court and one of the
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
footnotes says this section referring to
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
the sentencing section of the statute
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrates A continuing intent by the
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislature to provide the sentencing
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
judge with options to to adapt his or
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
her sentence to a particular individual
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
in the manner best suited to accomplish
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional objectives of
 
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
punishment re abilitation and deterrence
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
and it refers to an individual case um
 
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.230 align:start position:0%
and it refers to an individual case um
in

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
2022 there was another case most recent
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
one it looks like uh that is cited in
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
the notes and it says trial judges have
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
brought Authority Under This section to
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
provide for extended terms of of
 
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:48.519 align:start position:0%
imprisonment a range of fines probation
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
and conditional or unconditional
 
00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
discharge and refers to a 2022 case so
 
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
the courts have acknowledged that they
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
that they understand they're they're
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
sentencing U
 
00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:03.070 align:start position:0%
sentencing U
uh

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
flexibility uh and that's been repeated
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
throughout many of the footnotes and I
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if the committee has U access
 
00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
to those footnotes but I can certainly
 
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
provide those after the after the
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
hearing and that specifically sense says
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the legislation so
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
the judges know that that's what our
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
intent is I'd have to look at the actual
 
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
case this is an extract from from the
 
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
case but the extract is is clear that
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
this section referring to 651 two which
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
is entitled um
 
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:34.519 align:start position:0%
entitled sentences and
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
limitations and it clearly says within
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
the parameters sent uh I'm sorry uh this
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
section demonstrates A continuing intent
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
by the legislature to provide the
 
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
sentencing judge it goes on from on from
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
there thank
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Murphy oh thank you I
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
was wondering could you read that um the
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh was it what state was it the little
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
blur that you have that was proposed
 
00:30:01.389 --> 00:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
could you read that again available
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
Community Based alternatives to
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
confinement and the benefits that
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
imposing such Alternatives May provide
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
to the community should be considered
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
when the off when the offense is
 
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
nonviolent and the defendant is the
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
primary caregiver of a dependent
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
child thank you could you could would
 
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
you understand that to mean um not just
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
the community but to the dependent child
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
or the um the what whatever a disabled
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
adult or elderly parent is it just
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
considering the the community or are we
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
also considering the best interest of
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
child I read that to mean both okay that
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
um if there is a suitable Community
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
Based alternative to
 
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.549 align:start position:0%
Based alternative to
confinement

00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
confinement
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
uh that would benefit both the primary
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
caregiver and the dependent child then
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
you anyone else in the public want to
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039 align:start position:0%
bill if you have anything to add more I
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
guess we uh your position still the same
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
and feel free to join me if you want um
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
but I think a group of us um met this
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
morning um specifically focusing on the
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
child protection component I do think um
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
you know our position on this has been
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
pretty unwavering just because it's been
 
00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
hard for us to picture what a an easy
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
fix to this legislation would be um we
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
agree that there is Merit and this is
 
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
something that should be explored um but
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
I think like even just the term
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
nonviolent in that I think that language
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
is so close but just knowing the
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
complexities that we've had in
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
addressing you know what it like what
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
does it mean to actually be a violent
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
crime when it could actually be a
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
harmful act like loudness and indecent
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
exposure isn't considered a violent
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
crime like is it you know is there a
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
physical injury component of it and
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's what makes it a violent crime
 
00:32:21.549 --> 00:32:21.559 align:start position:0%
then that would leave out a lot of
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
things so I think you know I think if
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to continue to
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
explore this to look at how this could
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
fit in and I also just wanted to Echo
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
the funding component of it to make sure
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
that the adequate resources and services
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
are there so that we really are setting
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
Folks up for Success um I think just
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to Echo those things so I think
 
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
in brief yes our position is the same
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
but um we're happy to continue to have
 
00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.190 align:start position:0%
but um we're happy to continue to have
these

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
conversations did you sorry oh no and uh
 
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
like uh Pam was saying we did meet this
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
morning and we are very open to uh
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
discussing how we can um work together
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
and figure out how we can make this bill
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
um um a more better suit and fit to make
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
sure we support them and what they feel
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
um that this bill can be better so
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
having conversations like we did this
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
morning having a subcommittee and
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
speaking with you guys would be really
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah okay I'm just going to
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
say that when we heard this bill in our
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
hearing one of the things that I ask is
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
that we come together to see how um we
 
00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
can get this bill in a passable um you
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
know and um and attorney Andre and Andes
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
and um Pam and um I believe it was Grace
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
at the time um I thought would come
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
together to to figure some of this out
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
that whole laundry list that's here in
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
for me I would have preferred that it
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
just said
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
nonviolent and this is our violent crime
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire it tells
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
you all the difference so I think
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
carving it out probably wouldn't work
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
for us because we're leaving something
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
out and um the other on on children I
 
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
like that idea I mean but I do believe
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
this bill is has a lot of Merit I truly
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
believe that and um even when we list
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
like the um drug and alcohol treatment
 
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
anger management
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we even need to do that
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
I just believe that we there's so many
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
different Services out there some are
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
Citywide or or or based on where you
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
live I know we don't we um marac County
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
seems to have a lot going on that's
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
great Hillsboro County which is where I
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
live have we have a lot going on but not
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
enough and but we do have different
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
organizations like take Nashua that
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
actually everything that's listed here
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
there is someone or somewhere that you
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
could refer so for me to have a bill
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
like this I think is great I think it it
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
also keeps in mind with the um with the
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
court system that these things are here
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
you know and people people really do
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
have a problem and but we can solve
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
their help them to solve their problems
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know as long as it's not violent or
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
something that affected a child or all
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
the things that Pam just just name I
 
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
don't think it's
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
that when I listen to some of you speak
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
I I I feel like what's so difficult
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I just don't see it I really
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
don't see the difficulty that folks are
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
having with making certain
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
changes I think it's because there's a
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
lot of changes in there there and a lot
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
of them have some adverse effects
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
whether it's unknowingly or not but uh I
 
00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
think it's might be too big too wordy
 
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't but and at the same time
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't include a lot of stuff so
 
00:36:09.359 --> 00:36:10.589 align:start position:0%
doesn't include a lot of stuff so
representative

00:36:10.589 --> 00:36:10.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
Balden in crafting the language we did
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
um the stakeholders who uh participated
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
in crafting the language many were
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
invited but those who participated um we
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
discussed uh whether or not the options
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
that someone could be that a judge could
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
assign would be attainable and um I
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
think it's worth noting that like with
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
therapy for example um the CRI Criminal
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
Court isn't the only Court where you
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
could be ordered to go to therapy um it
 
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
definitely happens in the family court
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
system as far as uh estranged parent
 
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.109 align:start position:0%
system as far as uh estranged parent
child

00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
relationship um you know maybe someone
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
who has anger issues as it relates to
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
their family so it's not the first time
 
00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
time and I'm not just spitballing like I
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately know firsthand that it
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
didn't I wasn't assigned anything but it
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
is possible to for a judge to say you
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
have to go to therapy um and when
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
demands like that are made we do already
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
have systems in place in the state to
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's attainable such as
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
um expanding Medicaid there is a wide
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
variety of um mental health providers in
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
the state um and I certainly in my own
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
life have never had trouble finding one
 
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
that accepted my insurance and I've
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
certainly recommended it to lots and
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
lots of people because I do think
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
therapy is a really good choice in life
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
and I haven't really observed other
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
people having difficulty if you have a
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
really obscure insurance provider or a
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
bad plan you know it may be financially
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
limiting but that'd be something that
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
the court would need to take into
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
consideration and so as far as the
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
availability of Services they don't need
 
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
to be publicly provided they don't need
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
to be publicly funded um they don't need
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
to be coming from a a program um the way
 
00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
that the bill is worded it's just you
 
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
you need to do these things to take care
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
of your life to work on improving
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
yourself so that you're not going to be
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
in front of a judge in trouble for
 
00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:23.430 align:start position:0%
in front of a judge in trouble for
something

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
else anyone else have anything to had
 
00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a question um when you guys
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
met this this morning okay um did you
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
come up with anything so um there was uh
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate we
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
point um ourselves and then um Miss
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
Bernett and Miss Ki and then uh did I
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
miss anyone and Amanda oh and R balen um
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
and I think like we were all in the same
 
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
quandry um we all Express like again
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
that this has Merit but none of us had a
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
direct recommendation I know the
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
question was posed well what is the
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
population that's trying to be served
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
here and do we start with a list of
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
crimes that like were that are specific
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
or do we look at you know modeling
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
something off of or attaching something
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
to drug court and mental health court I
 
00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
think it's just a question of where we
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
can start maybe from a pilot um and then
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
grow go from there but there was no no
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
one had a an easy fix to this bill that
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
would satisfy by all of the concerns
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
that have been brought up especially
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
from a child protection angle um because
 
00:39:35.309 --> 00:39:35.319 align:start position:0%
there's just too many opportunities I
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
think to forget something when we're
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
rushing to move forward on a proposal
 
00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
when there's just a lot that really
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be considered so I think that's
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
kind of where we were coming from from
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
that lens I think if we had a solution
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
we would have proposed it months ago but
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
I mean and that's kind of why the bill
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
last session I don't think was able to
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
move forward either um because I I think
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
it just needs we need to look at this in
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
a in a very different way um also some
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the things that we um talked about
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
was um maybe instead of having a long
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
list of things that um you couldn't be
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
eligible for this bill or maybe coming
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
up with things that you would be
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for um also another thing that
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
I brought up this morning was if someone
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
previously had to sign onto the registry
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
or had a chased before of neglect and
 
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
they got their child back and they were
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
up for another case would they be able
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
to um be able to be eligible for this
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
bill now so that was something else that
 
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
we talked about um and um I also talking
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
about maybe talking to people about drug
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
cord and mental health um programming to
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
probably add to this and things like
 
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
that and educating judges on trauma
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
informs and things like that so we
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
talked about a few things and like I
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
said um previously just maybe I don't
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
know how many sessions we have like this
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
that we can have or how much time we
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
have left to have more um meetings that
 
00:41:08.589 --> 00:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
we could talk about how this can work
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
better for both parties but we we
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
definitely talked about a few things but
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much time we have to be
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
able to discuss this bill of making it
 
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
better for
 
00:41:21.069 --> 00:41:21.079 align:start position:0%
everyone um I know I don't think we have
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of time we have a lot of
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
bills in committee um and I think
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
continuing subcommittee meetings for a
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
few months I think we're going to run
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
out of time with it but um I think we're
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
on the right
 
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
path um representative Murphy thank you
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
um I think if it's determined that this
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is necessary if we need to
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
further clarify what's already in
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
statute um I would be opposed to listing
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
non-violent offenses as the qualifier um
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
because I think there are things that I
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
just think of many years in child
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
protection and as moms whether
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
somebody's you know going to be
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated or not that doesn't say
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
anything necessarily about their ability
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
to parent but it doesn't take into
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
consideration things like criminal
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
neglect um
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
exploitation um the vulnerable person as
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
the victim so you know um time is one of
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
the challenges I you know I I think that
 
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
this bill has great Merit but I think
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
that broader approach is a better thing
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
if it's determined that it's necessary
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
um because I think when we start getting
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
into qualifiers and you know we can only
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
we can only prescribe so much where a
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
judge you know we have to allow them
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
discretion and and um you know and and
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
again that goes back to my my thoughts
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
about funding the programs and training
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
for for for judges um so that this is
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized as as a need but I just I'm
 
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
just really want to be really cautious
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
about not fur further exacerbating
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences for
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
children in an effort to provide a
 
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
caretaker um and I think we I think you
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
can do that um but I I don't I just
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
don't know in the time frame you know
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
and I I mean I think that's one thing
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
that you guys would have to talk about
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
and just my input yeah I agree I think
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
in order to craft this properly like you
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
said without rushing it without missing
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
something just in the essence of time
 
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
here to get this through this this
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
session I think this this might be
 
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
better being worked on with all parties
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
and getting something that's going to
 
00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:35.559 align:start position:0%
work for for next perhaps rep
 
00:43:35.559 --> 00:43:37.589 align:start position:0%
work for for next perhaps rep
representative

00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
bden it it is possible and has been the
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
practice in this committee and years
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
pass and other committees in the house
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
to have multiple subcommittee meetings
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
on a bill um as long as they're properly
 
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
noticed we can plan several in advance
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
and work offline or rather just outside
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee room in between
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
those meetings um so as long as they're
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
properly noticed we can meet you know we
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
can schedule four more meetings and then
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
if we resolve it next time cancel the
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
rest and that just would need to be
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
noticed and um but I don't think that
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
four more meetings is necessary because
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
um I I think I feel confident personally
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
that if I could obtain any in writing
 
00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.630 align:start position:0%
that if I could obtain any in writing
outlining

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
outlining
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
um the entirety of what the Coalition is
 
00:44:24.549 --> 00:44:24.559 align:start position:0%
seeking uh for changes to this bill
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
something that I've repeatedly asked for
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
over 4 months um then it would be I
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
think fairly simple at least for me you
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
know with my experience reading
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and drafting legislation to
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
be able to incorporate that and I hope
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
to the greatest extent possible it's
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
always been my intent to work with the
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
Coalition on this and um incorporate
 
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
their views and in
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
particular um the Tennessee language
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
that we were moding after that I guess
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
ended up not being the language listed
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
certain crimes and we expanded the list
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
thereby excluding more people from
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
qualifying for this based on information
 
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
that ACLU obtained from some public
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
statement the Coalition made I think on
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
the issue of bail reform I I think that
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
might be it but the research that the
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
ACLU did is they said as far as we can
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
tell the Coalition is probably going to
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
want this to not be available to people
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
who've committed these and these and
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
these crimes and so the list is was in
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
the bill is longer than what was
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
originally introduced in Tennessee so it
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
has been our monthlong intent to work
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
with the Coalition and if they wanted to
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
produce any research or any
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
notes maybe via the text messages that
 
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
you know Pam has my number or on the
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
Google Doc that I sent her back in
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
September asking for her comments on or
 
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
just email me on my available email
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
address then I could Implement that
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
within a couple of days and have it
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
ready for the next subcommittee meeting
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
for all of us to
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
consider I appreciate that R balen and I
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
think with all due respect what we've
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
provided in writing and testimony last
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
session and this session is what we are
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
able to provide in terms of flags I'm
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
myself am not an attorney um I'm my
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
background is in looking at how we can
 
00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
prevent trauma and violence and I've
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
given all that I can possibly give I'm
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
happy to continue to connect folks to
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
other entities that we know and work
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
with that could maybe inform like some
 
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
of the folks here in the room today but
 
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know what else to provide
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
process anyone else that wants to speak
 
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.390 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
hi my name is gel I was here last
 
00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.190 align:start position:0%
hi my name is gel I was here last
time

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:54.559 align:start position:0%
testify I know I just wanted
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
to I would just wanted to to address to
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
to like you know the the
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
opposition um so I keep hearing that
 
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
they they were saying that this bill
 
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
isn't really necessary because the
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
judges already have discretion and they
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
can they can already do these things but
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
if if they were doing these things then
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't need this bill this bill
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be necessary they wouldn't we
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have worked they would have
 
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
worked this time and and this hard
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get this right so that so that
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
it could pass if it was being done if it
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
implemented um and I I also keep hearing
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
something about funding that that we
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
need to get funding and that they don't
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
have the the alternative sentencing the
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
other you know the places where they
 
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
would get some type of service instead
 
00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.470 align:start position:0%
would get some type of service instead
of

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
incarceration but that should not that
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be be something that's
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
preventing from passing this bill is
 
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
that they don't have funding for these
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
programs if anything then maybe this
 
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
would give them the push that they need
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
to start funding those program programs
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
but I don't think I think it would be a
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
disservice not to put this bill into
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
into effect based on that not being
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
enough programs or funding for all these
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
other alternative um Alternatives that
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
presented um I keep hearing and I
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
also the um coalition's concerned with
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
the children and the children and
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
someone being returns back to you know
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
to to possibly harm the dependent or and
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
whatnot that's that's that's why we have
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
DCF if there's anything that's involving
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
the children that's harmful that or has
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
been caused harm to the children by the
 
00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:39.079 align:start position:0%
primary caregiver then they're going
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to be um that's going to be
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
presented that's going to be there
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
because if there's dcyf involvement if
 
00:48:45.069 --> 00:48:45.079 align:start position:0%
there's something that has to do with
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
the children their person got
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
incarcerated then that's that's going to
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
be without saying with it goes without
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
saying that dcyf is going to be in
 
00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:53.799 align:start position:0%
charge that's what that's their that's
 
00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
what their job is not not not this bill
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
or not anyone else so if if so the the
 
00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:03.079 align:start position:0%
concern like it's kind of I don't
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
understand why that would be a concern
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
because also the same way that they say
 
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
that the judge has discretion now he
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
would he's going to also definitely have
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
discretion when considering this bill
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
and sentencing somebody according to
 
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
this bill because if if there is a
 
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
history or if there is something that on
 
00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:21.079 align:start position:0%
there like she said criminal neglect or
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
or or whatever that's the you you best
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
believe the prosecutor is going to
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
definitely present that and then the
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
person's not going to be necessarily
 
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
won't be eligible for to for the bill
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
but that would be that would be because
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
of that so we shouldn't we shouldn't not
 
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
pass the bill because we want to protect
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
the children because that's what DCF is
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
for so if there's something that's
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
involving the children then they're
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
going to be involved they get involved
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
when they don't need to be involved so
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to definitely be involved
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
if there's something that's going to be
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
of concern so so much concern that they
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be eligible for this
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
bill so it's almost contradicting to say
 
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
that the judge has discretion now and he
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
can can do all this now and then in the
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
same sentence say that but if do they
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
have this bill and they have the
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
criminal history or they did this in the
 
00:50:04.789 --> 00:50:04.799 align:start position:0%
past or they neglected their children um
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
they might get return back and Abus or
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
what or whatever you know what I'm
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
saying so it's you can't have it both
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
ways it's either one way or the
 
00:50:13.079 --> 00:50:17.470 align:start position:0%
ways it's either one way or the
other

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:19.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
and and as and and as The Plea deals
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
because they brought up the plea deals
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
again they usually you know the judges
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
really uh you know they rarely don't
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
accept the plea deal but let's keep in
 
00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:32.839 align:start position:0%
mind that the plea deal is presented by
 
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor it's not presented by the
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
people it's presented by the prosecutor
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
and they the people agree whether
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to take the deal or not
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
take the deal so that's not really being
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
worked out whether they are primary
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
caregiver or not
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
is I mean let's just be real they it can
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
be it's mentioned I'm sure it's
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned almost any almost every parent
 
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
that goes to court and is the parent is
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
responsible I'm almost positive that
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's one of the first things that they
 
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
say so again if it was if that was being
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
considered then we wouldn't be up here
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill because there
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be so many people who are in in
 
00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
jail or in prison for uh for for for
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
those things instead of alternative
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
sentencing and then lastly um I wanted
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
that ultimately I know this you know
 
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is for the primary caregiver
 
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
But ultimately it's for the people who
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
it's for the children or the dependant
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
who are affected by the primary
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
caregiver having to be incarcerated or
 
00:51:33.599 --> 00:51:34.630 align:start position:0%
caregiver having to be incarcerated or
or

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
imprisons because if the the parent is
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
going to be away from their children for
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
however long they're the ones whether
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
they're with DCF or with family or
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be but ultimately
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
like if speaking personally I'm an adult
 
00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm I'm grown already if if I
 
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
were to go you know to prison obviously
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be able to handle it a lot
 
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
better than the children going to be
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
able to handle it so they're the ones
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
who are going to ultimately suffer the
 
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:01.799 align:start position:0%
most not the not the person who's being
 
00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
incarcerated so that and that's the
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
point of this bill is to stop that from
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
happening to to interrupt that pattern
 
00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
of parents being and children to being
 
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
taken away from their parents and so on
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
forth and um I believe that's all thank
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
Balden thanks for calling on me so many
 
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
times without looking the least bit
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
exasperated um I think
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
probably the um uh giselli I think
 
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
brings up a good point that um in your
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
first comment that really could maybe be
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
phrased more concisely as like is this
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
bill going to do something and it'll do
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
bad things or is this bill already the
 
00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:47.799 align:start position:0%
practice of the court and so those are
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
those seem to be um mutually exclusive
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
Concepts and I think it's important to
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
get down to the the facts of the
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
situation and I think that we have
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
established at this point that while
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
this is always an option it's not a
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
directive to the
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
courts and then there's just the debate
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
over if this was um a directive given to
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
the courts would it make bad things
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
happen and I and I think that Gil then
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
spoke to that um I think really well
 
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
that um we already have systems in place
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
to protect people from abusers I'm not
 
00:53:21.069 --> 00:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
going to say that they're excellent
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
systems um but in if the goal of this
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
legislation as with any legislation is
 
00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
to solve a problem then we need to be
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
able to rely on existing systems to
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
address any possible unexpected outlays
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
because the more specific we get the
 
00:53:38.349 --> 00:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
more flawed it is and the broader it is
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
the more we open ourselves up to
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
unexpected situations so we have to
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
strike a balance there and I really
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
think that the one sentence in the
 
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
Tennessee law could do the deal
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
here okay representative M
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
Murphy yes um I know we talked about
 
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
time constraints and uh given um you
 
00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
know what we've heard today and at the
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing and I think we've all
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
agreed that this there's Merit to this
 
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:07.799 align:start position:0%
bill um sometimes that doesn't happen
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
and and it's easy to
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
itl I would support um an additional
 
00:54:16.349 --> 00:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
work session I think the um we have
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that are willing to be um
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
involved I think you know that Tennessee
 
00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
bill today um in my mind at least is a
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
bit more appealing maybe with some
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
tweaks um you know I certainly think it
 
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
deserves consideration and you know at
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
least one more subcommittee uh hearing
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
to see if we could have an amendment of
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
the the um Prime sponsor could bring
 
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
forth an uh an amendment in conjunction
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
with the stakeholders that we could
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
agree on um and I I would just hate to
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
throw it away because it I in my mind it
 
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
needs a lot of work but I
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
think limiting things and making it a
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more General would actually
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
be helpful and um I I would support a uh
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
session representative tenar I just like
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
to add that I concur with representative
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
Murphy on
 
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
that representative Bon
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
again or for the first time every seven
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
years all your cells get replaced who
 
00:55:21.789 --> 00:55:21.799 align:start position:0%
knows what happened since I talked last
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
last I might be a different person now
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
but um yeah I'm reminded my neighbors
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
across the street um their
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
grandchildren um their their adult
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
son committed some crimes lost custody
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
of his children um the his uh the mother
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
also ended up in prison and the
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
grandchildren the uh my neighbors cross
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
street didn't have the opportunity to
 
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
get the grandchildren and they've since
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
been adopted out names changed no
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
contact they live somewhere in Florida
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
and that is what we're talking about
 
00:55:58.589 --> 00:55:58.599 align:start position:0%
with like these there's a human child
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
right or a human dependent a person with
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
a severe disability an elderly parent
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
someone with dementia someone with
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
mobility issues who lives in this world
 
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
now and depends on a person for survival
 
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
and for to have their daily needs met
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
and the experience of that person either
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
having to figure out how to survive
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
without that person because they've been
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
incarcerated on something that in theory
 
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
we could address without incarceration
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
if this is narrow enough so either
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
having to survive without that person
 
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
which my mom would not be able to
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
function without me she doesn't seem to
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
be able to bring her dishes to the
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
kitchen without me but um you know or
 
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to end up in the care of
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
the state or and you know when you go to
 
00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
a County Nursing Home in New Hampshire
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
um or you know some kind of nursing home
 
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
often the arrangement is that your
 
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
property is signed over to the county
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
and everything you work your whole life
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
to pay for it's not going to go to your
 
00:56:56.109 --> 00:56:56.119 align:start position:0%
air is is going to go to the county for
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
sale and um you know or they're going to
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
end up in the system with new family
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
last name changed and there's all these
 
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
people in their lives that maybe they
 
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
could have enjoyed contact with Aunts
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
Uncles cousins uh friends that they were
 
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.039 align:start position:0%
in school with back home in New
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so those are the lives that
 
00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:13.799 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here it's not about
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
giving someone passing the buck on an
 
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
abuser it's about someone who's valued
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
and needed by their family who should
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to do that self-
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
reforming in an environment that also
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
enables them to keep delivering for the
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
people who depend on them if I
 
00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.390 align:start position:0%
people who depend on them if I
Disappeared

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
Disappeared
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow my family would probably be
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
homeless or have to leave the state
 
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
within two months I mean it just
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't work my kid wouldn't be in
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
college he's over at UNH Durham that
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
would go down the drain very quickly um
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
you know there's not enough coffee shops
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
and time in the world for him to work
 
00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
out to be able to stay in school much l
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know spending money at record stores
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
and so these are real lives for talking
 
00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
about this isn't um theoretical and and
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
I hope that we can focus on the people
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
and and again with the question
 
00:58:05.029 --> 00:58:05.039 align:start position:0%
of it does this court have this
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
discretion now in the original public
 
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
hearing for this bill we heard written
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
testimony read aloud to the committee
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
from people in New Hampshire who were
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
incarcerated who had dependence and what
 
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
the impact was on the lives of the
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
dependents when those providers those
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
caregivers were incarcerated so this is
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
happening it's not being considered as
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
often as maybe the court should and I do
 
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
think that it is really important for
 
00:58:31.789 --> 00:58:31.799 align:start position:0%
the committee to take action in some
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
regard and I'm more than happy to do all
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
the acrobatics and hard work myself
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
because I gave you this problem and I'll
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
deal with it but I want to make sure
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
that it's in coordination with all the
 
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and we get the maximum uh
 
00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
buying and support possible and hear all
 
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
sides thank you and just because we
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
heard testimony of people who ultimately
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
were incarcerated doesn't necessarily
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
mean that discretion wasn't used and and
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
those things weren't considered
 
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
incarceration was just a decision by the
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
judge and I don't know the scenarios in
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
those cases so I can't really comment on
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
the Merit of it but we don't know that
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
whether discretion was used or not so I
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
believe we're in agreement unless anyone
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
else wants to speak that we'll have
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
another session I'll schedule another
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
session and see what we can come back
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
with uh for language if it if it
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
satisfies the group and we'll go from
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
there so I don't when we here next week
 
00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to put it on a day that we're
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
already here does that make sense rather
 
00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
here I think we're only here on Friday
 
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
next week Friday yeah I'm looking right
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
now it's just Friday
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
Friday and the last bill is 12 so if we
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
schedule it for one Friday 2 or I try to
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
schedule it for for one with Karen and
 
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
see what we have is that enough time to
 
00:59:59.549 --> 00:59:59.559 align:start position:0%
you think a week to put together
 
01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
something that you think everybody would
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
can work
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
with yeah if the if I'm provided the
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
information that all the stakeholders
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
know I've been requesting I'm sure we
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
can work something out and I think the
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
issue with that single that simpler
 
01:00:17.069 --> 01:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
Tennessee language was the nonviolent
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
part of it so we come up with something
 
01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:21.039 align:start position:0%
we can work on it next week Jer Manion
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
yes um 1 pm doesn't let the committee m
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
do lunch though if we have the last bill
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
people look tzar is the perfect example
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
we need it we need at least an hour for
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
lunch 2 p.m. maybe what about a brown
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
bag subcommittee meeting you know they
 
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
say we can't eat in this building but
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
they can't stop all of us right so what
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
so I guess we can all agree the four of
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
us who are going to be adversely
 
01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
affected by it um what do we agree on
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
for a Time One 2 o'clock so you want to
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
have a lunch you want to do two does two
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
work two work for it's Friday night I
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know it's cut into my sleep
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
time a little bit CL isn't the deadline
 
01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
to notify the clerk like 4:30 today or
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
something isn't it isn't the deadline on
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays to put something in the
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
calendar I'll check with is Karen still
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
here I'll check with her right now if we
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
can put it in right now for two o'clock
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
on Friday see if that works all right
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
excellent with that I will close the
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
