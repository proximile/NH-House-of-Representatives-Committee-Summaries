00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative hunt good morning members
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm representative John
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
Hunt representing ringe and I'm uh like
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
to say I have great pleasure in bringing
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
this bill to
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
you but uh uh because it is a
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
repeal at least that's what I thought it
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.350 align:start position:0%
repeal at least that's what I thought it
was

00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
so um this past year um the uh we have
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
the new speaker you the speaker had
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
reelected so they were setting up a
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh commissions and we all know
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
how we want to have less commissions and
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
do away with commissions and so uh the
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
request came from me to to who we should
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
Commerce should be on this commission
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
and represent the uh from you know and
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
have to be you know both Republicans and
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
Democrats you know have to be and I
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
looked at it and I say no we don't want
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
no we don't want this commission there
 
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
there's no need for this commission and
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
so therefore I duy put it in my file to
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
say in September I'll put in a repeal of
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
this commission and um everything seemed
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
fine um you know was one of the first
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
ones in and uh they the department the
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
legislative Services quickly turned it
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
around for me and and uh and here here's
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
the bill now um yes it is true that I
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes I legislate on the Fly and not
 
00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
always always do a lot of homework on
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
things but you know repealing you know a
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
commission I thought that would be easy
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
I wasn't going to think too much about
 
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
it um I did know I had a call from Alex
 
00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department uh
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I didn't get to the call
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
um so but this morning
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
I woke up a little early and I said well
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
let me let me just look at the you know
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
think about what I'm was going to say to
 
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
you in terms of repealing this
 
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
commission so I really to go into the
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
exist what do you mean there's no
 
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
420j for 4 so 404 excuse me 404 J how
 
00:14:58.269 --> 00:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
could or 420 I said how could this how
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
could that be
 
00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
right and and I said well this you know
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
there must be a mistake here must be
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
something you know not right but um so
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
then I immediately go down to my phone
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
and take that voicemail from Alex and he
 
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
says oh by the way
 
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
John that statute doesn't
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
exist and and you all have I passed out
 
00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
you you probably don't have it represent
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
but I've just passed out in front of you
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
is and then so before
 
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
computers before computers if we wanted
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
to read the
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
rsas we went over
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
there okay I remember when I first got
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
on Commerce I used to drive the chairman
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
crazy because I would always want to see
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
what was in the statute because it was
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
so annoying to look at a bill would just
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
be like one paragraph a whole section
 
00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:50.759 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to know what the whole
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
thing was and he one time he tried to
 
00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:54.759 align:start position:0%
trip me up because he just got tired of
 
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
me kept looking over because I always
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to refer to the rsas but anyway
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
so if you go over to these rsas and they
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
are dated the books the hard Carvers are
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
dated and they don't they don't print
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
them too often can then they have these
 
00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:11.079 align:start position:0%
supplementals they stick in there so the
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
this 4 404 J 404 is um is hard cover was
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
2018 um this commission was created in
 
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
20 legislation in
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
2019 now for those of you who uh do the
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
math uh 2019 I was not in the Chairman's
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
chair I was the ranking
 
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
minority okay so I knew there there was
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
that I would want to get rid of this
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
Commission because it was created while
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
I was in the minority so there can't be
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
anything good about this commission but
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
not withstanding that not withstanding
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
that I I have no memory really of this
 
00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
at all okay um I do remember that the
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
bill um at at the end of the day what I
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
did find out cuz then so um my I'm
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
driving in and and I'm trying to find
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
out what what happened and I decided
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
that this was a good one for Jim cian
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
who is our house legal counsel and
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
fortunately he picked up the phone and I
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
said Jim can you tell me you know does
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
this statute exist or not exist or what
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
happened what I'm told by the insurance
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
department was that in the bill the way
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
the bill was written there was a poison
 
00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:29.799 align:start position:0%
pill and the poison pill Hill was that
 
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
some that the department or had to get a
 
00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
waiver that there had to be there was a
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
court case and the court case had to
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
find in favor to allow this miwa model
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
to to go forward well it turns out the
 
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
case died the case failed and so
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
therefore the statute the law should
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
never have gone into effect in the first
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
place so I could then say to you well we
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
don't need this bill let's just kill it
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
and let's call it a day could do that
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
that the problem is is that the
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
uh as I said there was the Democrats
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
were in charge so Mr felus former state
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
senator was the first name and he
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
actually had a hearing he they actually
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
used the statute they actually enacted
 
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
it they were treating it it was in the
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
law so theoretically it was in the law
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
so much to the extent that
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
even this year where um the speaker
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
asked me you know to make appointments
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
everybody assumed the law was there and
 
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
I guess there was a period of time that
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
it was there in the statutes but um the
 
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
insurance department told me they had
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
called the legislative services and said
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
to him you you might want to get this
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
thing off the books cuz it's not
 
00:18:55.149 --> 00:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
there um it I have a call into
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
legislative services to find out why
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
they would have me draw up an RS a bill
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
on a statue that doesn't exist so at
 
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
this moment I would normally would say
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
this just kill the bill and not worry
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
about it but I I said to to to Jim sansi
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
I said so you know I called him up and I
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
says is that of the right plan and I
 
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
said or do we need to just pass it and
 
00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
really put a stake in it so nobody know
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
we know that this thing doesn't really
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
exist and he said normally he said no
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
you probably don't need to do that but I
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
just saw him when I walked in the door
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
and he says well maybe you do
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
because there was an actual hearing on
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation so the fact that that
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know if we're you can't expunge an
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
event that it did occur you know was in
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
the calendar they had a meeting you know
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
to expunge that that maybe the best
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
thing to do would be to pass this so at
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
this moment um I I I don't know what to
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
say whether I want to pass this or not
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
pass it but I just want you to know um
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
in my 30 some years here I've never had
 
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
this happen to me before question and I
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
had my hand up first I'm more than
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
welcome to take
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
chair uh that motion is out of order
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
inquire oh that was bad
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
so uh uh representative hunt thank you
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
as people are want to say up here thank
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony it was most
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
interesting I can't say though that I
 
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
find found it
 
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
Illuminating but rather
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
perplexing and confusing so I'm trying
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
to understand uh it has been suggested
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
that we wipe this off the books with
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
this uh statute
 
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
B this bill excuse me this bill even
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
though it's not in statute because there
 
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
was a
 
00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:06.919 align:start position:0%
hearing because because but the hearing
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
has no has no force a hearing is a
 
00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
hearing it it it doesn't carry any
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
weight in the sense that it it has to be
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
carried forward with respect to an
 
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
action on the proposed legislation
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
correct so if the proposed
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
legislation was
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
sunsetted right because something
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
happened that made it moot wh why then
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
do we have to do anything at all I I I
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
know I'm asking you to explain to me
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
something that was explained to you well
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's why that's why I had this piece
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
of paper which you don't have well I I
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
do I do so what what on this piece of
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
paper tells me that I have to do what
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
you okay so that it wasn't effect for 60
 
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
days after 60 days it did take effect so
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's why it got stuck in the statutes
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
so now it's dead but it's gone but the
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
poison pill case decision occurred later
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
and so therefore it should have been
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
removed or should never have been
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
enacted but
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um it
 
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
did had enough life that the that the
 
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
commission did meet so was this excuse
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
me was was this an action of the
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
judicial branch that made
 
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
this actually actually I'm seeing all
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
these uh legal opinions here state of
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
New York versus US Department of Le yeah
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
this was a federal case all right so
 
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
we're just so now what you're saying is
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
that you're being advised that we should
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
clean this up legislatively because of
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
the action that occurred the ruling that
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
occurred in the courts well I would be
 
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
to be frank the advice I'm getting is um
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
he who knows I mean he he he at this
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
point even though he's our legal counsel
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
he he says it whatever way we the
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
committee decide to do is fine whatever
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
we do is fine yeah whatever we do is
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
fine thank you but that that that there
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
he could C he would his initial instinct
 
00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:05.559 align:start position:0%
is just kill it but then when he found
 
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
out that that that commission met and
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually that the some people treated as
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
though the law really was in effect then
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
he's saying maybe P passing the repeal
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
which you know we Republicans love
 
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
repeal so why why not go ahead and
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
repeal something so repeal nothing fine
 
00:23:28.269 --> 00:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
than in a vacuum uh rep side of M go
 
00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr chairman let me
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
try to clarify a little bit at one point
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
you said the bill had a hearing I think
 
00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:36.039 align:start position:0%
what you meant was the ill established
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
commission a hearing thereby giving it
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
some validity that we need to erase by a
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
formal repeal which should have happened
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
automatically which did which that did
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
not so you don't mean that the bill had
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
a hearing because that's entirely
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
irrelevant right the commission was
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
actually formed Commission in the
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
between passage and the court case
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
actually dying the court case didn't
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
didn't actually have a decision it
 
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
actually just went away right I think so
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's not the bill that had
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
a hearing the commission met giving it
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
some legitimacy so would you believe I
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
think we probably do need to I mean it
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like we need to repeal it
 
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
actually act on it make a repeal okay
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you represent bur did you have
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
you're all said um you just wanted to
 
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
get rid of okay thank you Mr
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I would say that would be very
 
00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
difficult to present to the full House
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
why don't we just withdraw the bill and
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
make it simple we we unfortunately do
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
not have that process thank you so yes I
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
would if we were to pass the Bill of
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
repeal we would I would assume we would
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
all put it on you know would put it on
 
00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:46.039 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar and simply say that
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
this bill is uh uh is attempt to clean
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
up the
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
statutes he thank you um I'm
 
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.750 align:start position:0%
statutes he thank you um I'm
representative

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um uh uh you're out of
 
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
order representative
 
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
Gibbs I just wanted to ask do you have a
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation as to what we should do
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
with this bill yeah I at this point I I
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
I think um the fact that we we ended
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
introducing it we ended up doing it then
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
I think we should just go ahead and just
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
pass the bill and um and and if the
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
Senators see it in a different light
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
then we won't care if they kill it but
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
but that at this point um I I think a
 
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
better part of valor is to just let's
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
pass it and and clean up the statutes
 
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
that makes sense thank you thank you um
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have an editorial in as
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
much as I'm the vice chair of the commit
 
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
special committee on commissions
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative hunt did exactly what we
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
would want him to do is to bring forth
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to get rid of Bill which
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
were became law the committee was
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
established legally and it is now
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
obsolete so thank you chairman
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%

and it would be my
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:07.470 align:start position:0%
and it would be my
fault

00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
portability
 
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
board so the intent of the bill was that
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
we have a conflict of interest in the
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
statute most statues
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
do the issue that representative Edwards
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to address through the bill was
 
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
what do you do if you have a conflict
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
how do you resolve
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
it so basically at that point in time if
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
you look at the statute it says that
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
someone has to declare it but if someone
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
did not declare it how do you resolve
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
that conflict
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
he also had in the bill the word
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
cohabitation when we had a meeting with
 
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
the board on December
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
18th there was discussion with the board
 
00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
about the word cohabitation how do you
 
00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:42.519 align:start position:0%
define it there somebody living with you
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
for two weeks 3 weeks I mean how do you
 
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
basically come up with a definition of
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
cohabitation representative Edwards was
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
agreeable at that meeting to strike
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
those words from the bill which I have
 
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
done in the
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment the other part of it is that
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
what do you do when you get to a
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
conflict and someone basically says
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
foul how do you resolve it and what I'm
 
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
proposing in the amendment is to
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
basically allow for a two-step
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
process step one is going to the board
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
itself and asking the board to weigh in
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
on the conflict and maybe work with the
 
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.029 align:start position:0%
on the conflict and maybe work with the
individual

00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
about being
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
recused in talking with Senator abbis he
 
00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799 align:start position:0%
said that made sense and he said well
 
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
what do you do when you have no
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
resolution between the claimant and the
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
board so the board says no there's no
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
conflict but somebody who through the
 
00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:47.519 align:start position:0%
flag said there's still a conflict and
 
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
there was a disagreement there what do
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
you do and at that point time they said
 
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
well you go to an arbitrator and let the
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
arbitrator decide if they was in fact a
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
conflict was it done intentionally was
 
00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:03.190 align:start position:0%
conflict was it done intentionally was
it

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
unintentional basically understand what
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
happened so in the amendment I used the
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
word attorney
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
general Senator abis didn't like that
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
because when you start talking about the
 
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
attorney general doing a
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
review it really doesn't look good for
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
the individual and that's not what we're
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
trying to get here so we said maybe the
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
appropriate party is going to be the
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
attorney on the board so you have an
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
attorney which is not a board member
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's just somebody on the board
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
representing the board have them review
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
it and let them become the arbitrator so
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what we're trying to get
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
to here is that a if someone does have a
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
conflict and someone wants to file a
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
violation there's a process and the
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
process basically comes down to you go
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
to the board in non-public session and
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
you have a discussion and let the board
 
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
make the first cut at it to determine
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
whether there's a conflict or not
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
if there's still not agreement between
 
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
the parties you go to an arbitrator
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
which would be the board's
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
attorney and let them decide
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
it once there's been a
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
ruling that the individual did in fact
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
have a conflict which is not
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
disclosed then you could remove the
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
person when that person gets
 
00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
removed we believe that the person to
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
replace that individual was the party or
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
the entity that appointed them in the
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
first place
 
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
so basically if it's
 
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
a person appointed by the Speaker of the
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
House you go back to the speaker and you
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
ask for him or her to appoint a new
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
person for the length of the term
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
remaining if it's a Senate President you
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
go back to the Senate if it's the
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
governor you go back to the governor so
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
basically that's the process we're
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
trying to work on here with the bill and
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
also with the
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
amendment so in saying that I'll leave
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
it for questions from the committee to
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do I think
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
fundamentally is that representative
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
Edwards which the board agrees with that
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
there should be some process in place to
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
deal with a conflict of interest that
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
somebody thinks was not
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
disclosed okay so both Senator abis
 
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me Senator abis and and
 
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards know about this
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
amendment yes I talked to Senator abis
 
00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
last night he's the one that um provided
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
some guidance and he talked about the
 
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
same thing about the concern of using
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
the word attorney general because it's
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
kind of honorous I mean nobody wants to
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
have on the record that you went through
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
the attorney general for a review it's
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
not something you really want to have
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
out there but it should be done by
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
somebody who has a legal background and
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
the board attorney because they're not a
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
board member but they're there to advise
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
the board would be the appropriate
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
person to go to okay so that's the
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
conflict identified by the Attorney
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
General but I would change attorney
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
general to board's attorney oh you you
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
want to have that changed yes board
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
attorney and I will be more than glad to
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
another amendment okay I'll make another
 
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
amendment now hence my my confusion okay
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
question about that yeah so you thank
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
you representative Terry uh I'm
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can disabuse me of the
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
notion that by identifying the attorney
 
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
board you're still not as an
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
arbitrator you're still not waiting in
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
the in favor of the board would not the
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
attorney to the board could not and
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
would not the the board's attorney be
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
consulted anyway and even if the
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
attorney were to be consulted
 
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the attorney is the
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
attorney of the board and not a true
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
neutral third party I understand this is
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
difficult but I'm not sure that this is
 
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
the a good fix can you disabuse me of
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
that that notion um I think I here we
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
get concern is that is the attorney for
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
the board truly a neutral
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
party and in essence I would say as an
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
attorney I would hope that their ethics
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
would be what's driving their decision
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
not because they happen to be connected
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
to the board um I'm not opposed to
 
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with another form of
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
arbitration but I'm trying to be sure
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
that it goes through sort of a legal
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
review and not through a political
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
review well for the question me inquire
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
so I would urge you to do that because
 
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
the perception here is not a good one uh
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
in my view I'm trying to put myself in a
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
in in this kind of a situation and I'm
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
looking for a neutral third-party
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
arbitrator and I'm not seeing that I'm
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
seeing somebody who is actually related
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
to one of the parties that are in the
 
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
dispute so thank you if representative
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
Terry if I may um if you have some
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations by all means I'd be more
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
than glad to or the committee could I
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
concern we it will have a subcommittee
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
anyways but yeah we we need to find
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
something before the you know
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%

for
clarification

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
attorney general so what you're
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
proposing is to change attorney general
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
wherever it says that to to board
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
attorney correct thank you uh further
 
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
question may
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
inquire further question may inquire
 
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:44.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh has any conflict of interest ever
 
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
actually occurred on the prescription
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
drug app affordability board no not to
 
00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
my knowledge there was a board member
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
initially on the board
 
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
that the individual some people felt
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
that the person had a conflict and that
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
person was removed from the board thank
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
you yeah I'm sorry about my pause there
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
because I actually wrote something down
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
differently I wrote because it says
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
identified by the Attorney General so I
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
said ident identified by the attorney
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
appointed by the attorney general that
 
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
works okay so that way a we made sure
 
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
that you know the attorney and this and
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
that the the one that is appointed by
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
the I I think if we have that language
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
in there hun chairman um an attorney
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Attorney General's
 
00:37:40.589 --> 00:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
office I think that's probably a
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to go right and so it
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
L I'm looking at the
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and I was looking on page two
 
00:37:59.470 --> 00:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
correct I think it works
 
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
l so down to 18 or 19
 
00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.349 align:start position:0%
l so down to 18 or 19
disclosure

00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
remember shall be reviewed by the New
 
00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attorney
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
general I think we're trying to get to
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
be consistent we be attorney appointed
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
by the Attorney
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
General okay yeah okay yeah okay that
 
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
General okay yeah okay yeah okay that
makes

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
makes
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.349 align:start position:0%
makes
sense

00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right we were looking at two
 
00:38:30.319 --> 00:38:31.150 align:start position:0%
okay all right we were looking at two
different

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
places okay good yes represented pelli
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me ask the
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
question we have many different boards
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
commissions Etc uh is there already an
 
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
existing conflict of interest policy
 
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
that you've been able to discover so
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
that we're not trying to reinvent the
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
wheel that's a very good question I
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the other boards um
 
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
the issue of what do you do to resolve a
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
conflict is what we're addressing here
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
with this board but I think that issue
 
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about maybe gerain to
 
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
other boards as
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
well for the question may inquire well I
 
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
just wanted to be consistent so if there
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
already is a policy in place with other
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh boards and commissions I would just
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
ask that we be
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
consistent good that I can't speak to
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
because I really don't have the
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge but it's a good
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
point yeah
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
um I mean if I can clarify would it be
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
nice to yeah if we could refer to an RSA
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's already on the books correct yeah
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
okay I I'll have our researcher I'll
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
have our researcher look that up yeah
 
00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
okay do we Mr chairman I mean part of it
 
00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
too be do we have something even in our
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
house um rsas that drive us because we
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
can have conflicts what do we do when we
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
have a conflict how do we resolve it I
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
mean that's what trying to get to well
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
we do we we have the conflict of the uh
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%

ethics but that's only for
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%

today this is maybe one of those rare
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
moments in
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
life in
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
which both parties come together over
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
the principle of
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
premarket and fundamentally if you think
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
about where we have come with generics
 
00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
today and the ability to contain
 
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
cost the use of generics has been
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
phenomenally successful
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
it has created a tremendous amount of
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
savings both for the patient insurance
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
companies and so
 
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
forth to give you an
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
example if you look at the L latest
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
latest edition of the insurance
 
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.630 align:start position:0%
latest edition of the insurance
department

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:48:43.549 --> 00:48:43.559 align:start position:0%
report of
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
2021 biologics now account for over 50%
 
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
of the drug spend 50% of the drug
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
spent last year according to their data
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
25% and that's because of a free market
 
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
when you have competition in the
 
00:49:09.789 --> 00:49:09.799 align:start position:0%
marketplace it does what it's supposed
 
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
to do the Invisible Hand of the
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
market through competition brings
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
product price
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
down and what I'm trying to do with this
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
bill is do the same thing in biologics
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
that we have done with traditional
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
generics now you're going to hear about
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that biologics are not 100%
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
interchangeable and I
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
concur however the FDA goes through
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
switching studies which basically
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
means that they take patients and they
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
put them on drug a and then switch them
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
over to drug B they know that clinically
 
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
they work the same but the concern is
 
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
the risk factor can you actually change
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
between one biologic with the other one
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
and not cause harm to the
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
patient if the FDA says they're
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
interchangeable therefore the risk to
 
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
the patient harm wise has been
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
neutralized because through the studies
 
00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:11.799 align:start position:0%
switching back and forth that is what
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
happens however the FDA is silent in
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
this whole process and what I'm trying
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
to get to in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
with free or die is to bring the
 
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
principle the free market to biologics
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
and on the back of this
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
diagram what I'm basically saying same
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
thing the FDA is saying is that if drug
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
aera is equal to drug B and Drug a is
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
equal to drug
 
00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.990 align:start position:0%
equal to drug
C

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
C
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
therefore b equals c they're
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
interchangeable it's the same thing that
 
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
happens with traditional generics a
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
generic manufacturer does not have to
 
00:50:54.839 --> 00:50:56.349 align:start position:0%
generic manufacturer does not have to
show

00:50:56.349 --> 00:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
show
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
bio availability equivalency between
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
another generic manufacturer only with
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
the reference product they only have to
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
go back and say my drug is equal as a
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
therefore if you're in the bucket of
 
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
interchangeability all drugs that are
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
interchangeable are themselves
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
interchangeable because they've gone
 
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
through the scrutiny of the FDA and what
 
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to advocate for here in New
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is to allow for greater
 
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
flexibility greater competition so that
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
we can make drugs more
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
affordable to the patient to the
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and start working on
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
the escalating cost of biologics to give
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
you an example male
 
00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
clinic spent over $107
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
million they went through something
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
comparable in the first year alone they
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
saved over $20
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
million is almost a 20% decrease
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
subsequent years it gets less because
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
you don't have the opportunity to save
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
more money M because you do a lot of it
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
in the first year so all this bill
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
fundamentally does is allow for that
 
00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the marketplace to open
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
up competition by the way in
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
Europe this only deals with drugs the
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
FDA considers to be interchangeable with
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
each other in Europe through 20 years of
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
History if you have a bio similar
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement to do switching
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
studies it's just basically that point
 
00:52:26.789 --> 00:52:26.799 align:start position:0%
in time if you look at the cost of their
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
biologics compared to ours it's
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
dramatically different why because they
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
have more competition than we do here in
 
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
the United States so it becomes a
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
barrier to competition I'm trying to
 
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
minimize and trying
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
to erase if you will so that the market
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
can for perform the way it supposed to
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
perform so that's the intent of the bill
 
00:52:52.789 --> 00:52:52.799 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple a equals B A equals c
 
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
therefore b equals C thank you
 
00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.270 align:start position:0%
therefore b equals C thank you
Mr

00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
chairman repres
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
senary uh I think I would like some
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
clarification on the terms biosimilar
 
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.190 align:start position:0%
clarification on the terms biosimilar
and

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.910 align:start position:0%
and
equal

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
equal
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
because equal to me means the same
 
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
biosim a similar means like in
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
presumably since this is a drug in terms
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
of its shall we be kind and say benefit
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
has the same effect
 
00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
so you have two drugs that have the same
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
effect even though they're not the same
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
therefore they're not truly equal in the
 
00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
sense that 3 equals 3 2 equals 2 because
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
two is two so 2 equals 2 right so
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not they're
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
equivalent in terms of their
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
effect but they're not equivalent
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
because they actually have
 
00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
different names so they're they're not
 
00:53:57.549 --> 00:53:57.559 align:start position:0%
exactly the same and that's the reason
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
why they're generic instead
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
of uh what's the term for the original
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
brand name right am I am I getting this
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
yes and no um how about the how about
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
the yes part first okay sure the yes
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
part is that when we deal with biologics
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
when you deal with traditional what they
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
call small molecules they are in fact a
 
00:54:21.789 --> 00:54:21.799 align:start position:0%
chemical which you can duplicate
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
identically now just to understand
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
within the generic Market
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
when you have a generic it's not
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
identical to another generic the active
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
ingredient is but the fillers the
 
00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:35.559 align:start position:0%
binders and everything else that goes
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
into the tablet are different so they're
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
not identical to each other the active
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
ingredient is identical but the compound
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
itself collectively is
 
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
not so it's it's like by analogy it's
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
like a different packaging it's putting
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
the same product in a different package
 
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
well you're saying the filler when you
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
when you when you make a tablet the
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
amount of active ingredient a lot of
 
00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
times it's say 40 milligrams yeah is the
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
size of maybe top of a pin head it's
 
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
small right so you can't possibly put
 
00:55:10.589 --> 00:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
that into a formulation so what you do
 
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
is you put lactose with it you put other
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
ingredients to make the tablet large
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
enough the person to handle it also the
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
way it works within the body if you want
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
it to dissolve you have what they call
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
binders and things that go into it and
 
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
those things are not regulated by the
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
FDA so therefore what the manufacturer
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
has to do is show that their formulation
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
of the generic product does in fact work
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
the same way in the body that the brand
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
name does right yeah I'm sorry I I think
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
I misled you using the term
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
packaging um you've
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
explained the need for the fillers
 
00:55:51.549 --> 00:55:51.559 align:start position:0%
because the 40 milligrams or whatever is
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
so small you you you you couldn't even
 
00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
find it in the vi when you're taking it
 
00:55:59.029 --> 00:55:59.039 align:start position:0%
sorry so what you have with generics is
 
00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
you have different fillers all right but
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
you're it's it's essentially the same
 
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
drug so when a generic comes along a
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
generic is the same is is the same has
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
the same drug so to speak but it would
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
have different binders and fillers and
 
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
that's what makes for generic it it it
 
00:56:21.069 --> 00:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
has the same active ingredient active
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
ingredient but the inactive ingredients
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
are different okay
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank uh real quickly uh
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs would would you go
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
please thank you uh just to be sure I
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
understand um is it correct that the the
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
diagram you handed out shows the
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
situation as it is today and that's what
 
00:56:46.109 --> 00:56:46.119 align:start position:0%
you're trying to change correct today
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
basically if you look at the FDA what
 
00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
goes on in the
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
marketplace the switching studies which
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
shows again that you can switch the
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
products between each other with minimal
 
00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
risk to the patient they work clinically
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
the same that is back to like same thing
 
00:57:04.109 --> 00:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
with generics you drug B has been shown
 
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
to be equal to drug a drug C has been
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
equal to drug a what I'm saying is the
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
same thing with generics B is equal to C
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
there's no risk basically to the patient
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's gone again it's gone through a
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of studies with
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
patients they basically have to go
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
through the process is take patients on
 
00:57:26.029 --> 00:57:26.039 align:start position:0%
drug a switch them over to B
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
take drug B switch them back to a so
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
they can show that there is no risk to
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
the patient when the change occurs the
 
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
further question so today you cannot
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
switch from drug B to drug C but you
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
want to make it so that you can switch
 
00:57:45.029 --> 00:57:45.039 align:start position:0%
from B to C because of the equivalence
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
with a correct I'm trying to allow for
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
the market so to instead of the
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacist if you write for drug B I
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
only can give you a so to give you an
 
00:57:58.990 --> 00:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
idea herera cost about $3,300 a
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
month drug B cost about $1,200 a month
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
drug C cost less than $600 a month so if
 
00:58:08.109 --> 00:58:08.119 align:start position:0%
I sit there as a pharmacist and if you
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
write for drug B at 1,200 I can't give
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
you the one drug C for 600 because I
 
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the authority to make that
 
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
change and what I'm saying is by
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
allowing all three to be considered
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
interchangeable with each
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
other as a pharmacist working with the
 
00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:26.359 align:start position:0%
patient I can then therefore work with
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
the patient to say well you don't need
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
to buy a $1,200 drug there's one here
 
00:58:30.839 --> 00:58:31.950 align:start position:0%
to buy a $1,200 drug there's one here
for

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
600 that FDA shown that they're equal to
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
the brand name and we can save you a
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money $1,200
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
versus 600 that's $7,000 a year folks Mr
 
00:58:47.789 --> 00:58:47.799 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr wait question you're also
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
okay represent m one has a question
 
00:58:53.069 --> 00:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and sorry I'm a
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
little bit rushed I've got to introduce
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
a bill 11 um so the one thing that we're
 
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
not talking about here is truly the
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
different types of
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
biologics identicals and similars that's
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
the term neither of them are in the bill
 
00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:10.119 align:start position:0%
right those are the terms that influence
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
what's prescribed what's therapeutically
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
effective and what's paid for and and
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
that's why it's in this committee
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
because this is fundamentally a payer
 
00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
payer issue at at the potential expense
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
of therapeutic benefit right so we have
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
to talk about and I I'll invite you to
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about if I'm assuming
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
you're familiar the definitions of
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
biological similar and a biological
 
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.039 align:start position:0%
identical right everyone here
 
00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
understands generic pyc versus you know
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh whatever all the different those
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
generics but in the small molecule large
 
00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:43.750 align:start position:0%
generics but in the small molecule large
molecule

00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
molecule
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
world the the likelihood of protein
 
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
sugars attaching to proteins differently
 
00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
uh all the immunogenicity problems
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
there's there's sign ific issues and
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's why they're defined as either
 
00:59:59.230 --> 00:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
biological similars or identicals and we
 
01:00:01.029 --> 01:00:01.039 align:start position:0%
have some work to do in subcommittee but
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
if you can talk about those issues
 
01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
that'd be great first of all there's no
 
01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:07.039 align:start position:0%
such thing as a biological identical it
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist it's Nature Made and
 
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
therefore even within the same brand
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
name trade name if I may from one batch
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
to the next they're not
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
identical because exactly okay so
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
therefore even within the brand name you
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
don't have things that are identical
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
just like do with chemicals between one
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturer another the active
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
ingredient is identical but the inactive
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
ingredients may not the same thing here
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
when you talk about a
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
biosimilar it works clinically the same
 
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's why you have switching studies to
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
show that you can change from one drug
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
to the other without risk to the patient
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's why the FDA forces that switching
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
study further
 
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
question I thought you were hurrying up
 
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
till 11 o' for for for example even if
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
they have the same peptide chain it's
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
known that they may not have the same
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic effect right they may they
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
might may just be delivered different
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
differently anyways I think it's subit
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
it's okay we'll go to subcommittee I
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
think what I'm saying simple question
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
yeah okay now representa
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
Terry so as an insurance subcommittee
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
member at an insurance subcommittee
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
hearing today um and and unlike a former
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
speaker of the United States house I do
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
feel the responsibility to understand
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
the bill before I passed the bill I
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
would I I I am perplexed here
 
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
um and I think the best way for me to
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
ask the question is if the I I recall
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
that when a prescription in the old days
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
would be filed on on paper and I would
 
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
take it to the pharmacist it would say
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
generic sub substitution permitted so if
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
we were in that kind of a situation and
 
01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:04.279 align:start position:0%
my doctor prescribed Huma but generic
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
substitution was permitted then you as
 
01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:09.799 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist if you don't mind my
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
personalizing this you could substitute
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
drug b or the Lesser expensive drug C
 
01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
right but if the doctor prescribed drug
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
B which is a generic then you could
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
and and allow generic substitution there
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
is no generic because it is a generic
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
then you would not be able to provide me
 
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
with drug C because the doctor had
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
prescribed drug B is that is that corre
 
01:02:43.269 --> 01:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get at this from the
 
01:02:43.279 --> 01:02:44.589 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get at this from the
standpoint

01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
of brand named drug generic substitute
 
01:02:51.269 --> 01:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
permitted you can give me drug C because
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
it costs less than drug B right you can
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
do that but if the doctor prescribes
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
drug b or drug C you cannot prescribe
 
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
drug C or drug B the substitute for C or
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
B correct okay and what I'm trying to
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
get to here is that when you have a
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
prescription just like you do with
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
generics if the pro provider the
 
01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:16.039 align:start position:0%
prescriber writes on the prescription
 
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
medically necessary dispense is written
 
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
I have no authority to change that
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
prescription without your approval so if
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
a doctor really feels that they don't
 
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
want to have any substitution at all
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
then at that point in time I'm Bound by
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
that limitation okay follow for question
 
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.789 align:start position:0%
that limitation okay follow for question
me

01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
thank so to your uh to your comment
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
earlier or to to your uh remark earlier
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
that a generic would be
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
biosimilar to the brand name drug am I
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay so I go to my eye doctor recently
 
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
and I have dry eye and we're talking
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
about rasis and then we're talking about
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
cyclo something or other which is a
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
generic and she
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
says we don't want to give you the
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
generic because it's no good it doesn't
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
work as well as Restasis so I'm trying
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
to understand how can a generic which is
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be biosimilar be classified
 
01:04:23.269 --> 01:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
by a provider is no good compared to the
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
brand named drug unless the provider is
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
carrying water for
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
the yeah can you can you help me with
 
01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
that one well that because that that
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
does bear on this bill what what need
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
what we have to go back to we should go
 
01:04:40.349 --> 01:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
back to is what I call the orange book
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
of substitutability the FDA goes through
 
01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
studies to show that a generic is
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
substitutable for the brand and it's
 
01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
given what they call an AB rated which
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
means at that point in time it's
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
substitutable some drugs and this could
 
01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
be the case with stasis it's B rated not
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
a rated so therefore the FDA is saying
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough data to support The
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
Interchange and as a pharmacist if it's
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
not a rated which means it's been
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
approved by the FDA for
 
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
interchangeability I can do it but if
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
it's B I
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
can't so the FDA is calling the shots if
 
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
the FDA says it's a b-rated product as a
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
pharmacist I cannot do The Interchange
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
without the provider status if it's
 
01:05:23.079 --> 01:05:24.630 align:start position:0%
without the provider status if it's
a-rated

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
a-rated
 
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
the FDA says they're interchangeable
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
then I
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
can quick file therefore yes sir do you
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
give me permission yes yeah then I'll
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
time so I wish we we need to be a little
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
light here so uh so what happened in
 
01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
this instance was the provider actually
 
01:05:51.269 --> 01:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
prescribed B the generic and then a year
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
later told me it it's junk and I'm not
 
01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:55.799 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not going to prescribe this
 
01:05:57.269 --> 01:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
any longer we're going to go back to a
 
01:05:59.230 --> 01:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
or you'll have to do something else okay
 
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacist it has to distinguish between
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
a and b and can only substitute if
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
generic is permitted if it's a corre
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
classified rather than b correct and
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing I'm trying to get to
 
01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
here with this diagram is that when this
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
the FDA goes through the
 
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
interchangeability studies it's saying
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
that they have documentation that it's
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
safe for the patient they work the same
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
exactly and these are both A's all these
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is they all are
 
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
considered A's what I want to be clear
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
in our state law that we consider them
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire all
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
equivalent and therefore a pharmacist
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
can have the ability of using the
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
marketplace to give the patient the
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
lowest cost drug available to them so
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
instead of buying a $1,200 drug which is
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
a generic they could actually buy the
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
back um so I was kind of scratching my
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
head to figure out why this bill's here
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
rather than than that uh Health and
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
Human Serv a different committee but I
 
01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
just noticed there the key
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
words medically necessary cor right
 
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's our possession that's not
 
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
hhs's that's that's us right so the only
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
thing I would
 
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
be somewhat I guess thinking that I want
 
01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure I do this is that when a
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacist makes this recommendation go
 
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
with other is that it really does save
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
money that the the recommendation is
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
based on a
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
monetary value other other than than you
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
know because you've said that several
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
times in your testimony that in one
 
01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
there's a cheaper one I guess I thinking
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
I might want to have write that into
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
this this bill M chairman hun if that's
 
01:07:52.829 --> 01:07:52.839 align:start position:0%
what it takes to get the bill through
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
the committee that's fine I I think um
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in general that's an advocate
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
for the patient is trying to find out
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
how to make drug therapy more affordable
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
right but if you want to insert that
 
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
that's fine just also I just got a text
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
um um the chair of the prescription
 
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
sorry the chair of the New Hampshire
 
01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
pharmacist Association and also the um
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
chair of the pharmacy board the pharmacy
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
board voted unanimously yesterday to
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
support the bill great I have a question
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
or just uh okay represent Herber thank
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
you um just just for the record uh I
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
can't be seen I have a family member
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
that uh takes a
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
thyroid uh medicine and uh it was called
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
armor by shorthand was armor I think it
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
had something to do with a pig yeah it
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
did it did and and uh and and
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh somebody came up with a synthetic
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
generic and uh didn't work for my family
 
01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
member but on the armor uh drug was
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
taken off the
 
01:09:08.669 --> 01:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
market it was so so what what we did is
 
01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
we went to a pharmacist who can could
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
make the uh
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
compound uh on his own but the insurance
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
was gone it wasn't going to pay for it
 
01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
and fortunately it's not a fortune to uh
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
do but I that is a circumstance that you
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
might have the uh the cost cutting
 
01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
actually bump a
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh a superior product for a number of
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
people off the uh off the shelf and in
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
that case you're insurance they won't
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
so in that case it wasn't cost
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
effective well when there's always
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
exception there's always exceptions to
 
01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
everything I hear what you're saying
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
about armor it was a great product but
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
un unfortunately and it's right it was
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
taken from the thyroids from uh animals
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
if you will and it was a natural product
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately the FDA said you have
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
to go through and show studies that it's
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
effective so the company said we can't
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
afford to pay for all the studies
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
because the margin on the product is so
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
small there's no return on the
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
investment so they basically did away
 
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.110 align:start position:0%
investment so they basically did away
with

01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
it representative melier has a question
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
yes I do thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
Carrie oh oh sorry about that quick
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
question has has this legislation or
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
similar legislation um been enacted or
 
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
proposed in any other states that you
 
01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.669 align:start position:0%
proposed in any other states that you
know

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
of I'm not aware of it I mean I can do
 
01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
some research I talk to the industry and
 
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
so forth about it
 
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
um but I can do some research to find
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
out and so forth that would be I mean
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
I'm also working with the trade
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
associations tentatively they're coming
 
01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
out in support of the bill but they want
 
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
to be sure that goes to the biosimilar
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
um Committee in order to sign off on it
 
01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
but the initial pass on it is that
 
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
they're in support of of it um correct
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
well look forward to hearing from you
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
when we do the subcommittee thank you
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay having no more questions thank you
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
very much is there anyone else who would
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
bill okay seeing none we will close the
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
um representative Merchant did you fill
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
one I believe yeah on both bills oh I
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
see this one actually was 1225 you never
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
1236 no no you just you testified you
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
who and therefore you fill out a paint
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
card when you do
 
01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:22.470 align:start position:0%
card when you do
that

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.480 --> 01:17:48.990 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
um so this is uh
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.590 align:start position:0%
um so this is uh
Jason

01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
Jason
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
you have to push the button and hold the
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
mic close for the record Jason AES
 
01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
director of Health economics insurance
 
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
department okay so uh the reason why I'm
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
asking you because I know the department
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't take uh positions on what I
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
would call mandates the question I have
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
is that um I knew under the Affordable
 
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
Care Act there was limitations upon um
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
any new health insurance mandates so I
 
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
was just wondering whether you know
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not whether this bill falls
 
01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
into that category yes if this bill in
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
its current form if it were enacted
 
01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
would be subject to the cost of frail um
 
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
the the federal cost defa defrayal for
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
the exchange Marketplace why don't you
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
explain that to the committee what that
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
cost consequence is there's a federal
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
law rule that states that if we man if a
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
state mandates coverage that goes beyond
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
what's referred to as essential health
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
benefits which is defined by our S
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
silver plan in New Hampshire then the
 
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
state would be responsible for paying
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
any additional cost that that occurs and
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation would would qualify as
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
that uh in addition to that this um Bill
 
01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
if if it were passed would be subject to
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
um referral to the insurance department
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
for a mandate study to to estimate the
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
economic cost and the social cost of
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
this new
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
legislation perfect thank you thank you
 
01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:24.390 align:start position:0%
very much okay now so the
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:27.189 align:start position:0%
very much okay now so the

experience is helping people with
 
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
diabetes for decades are what inspired
 
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
me to bring this bill forward House Bill
 
01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:23.960 align:start position:0%

diabetes device affordability act seeks
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
to require commercial insurers and

Medicaid to cover glucose monitoring
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
devices and the necessary supplies for
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
all people with
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
diabetes not being sure how much folks
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
on this committee know about diabetes
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you to bear with me
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
while I give you a brief 101 of diabetes
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
so it'll help you understand why this is
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
important diabetes is a common condition
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
that increases the risk of complications
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
such as heart disease stroke kidney
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
failure blindness or amputation of a
 
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
lower limb it is the seventh leading
 
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
cause of death in the US controlling
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
blood sugars well dramatically reduces
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
the risk of these complications as well
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
as improving quality of
 
01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:11.590 align:start position:0%
as improving quality of
life

01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
98,500 people in New Hampshire are
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
currently diagnosed with diabetes that's
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
just under 9% of our
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
population there are 6,600 new cases
 
01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
diagnosed each year in New Hampshire
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
29,000 New Hampshire people have
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
diabetes and don't know it and in
 
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
additional whopping 351,000 people in
 
01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or just under 33% of our
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
population have pre-diabetes meaning
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
their blood gluc levels are above normal
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
but not high enough to diagnose diabetes
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
and they're vulnerable to developing
 
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
diabetes so we all know someone probably
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
more than one person with diabetes
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
diabetes is expensive
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
in 2017 the most recent data I found
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
there were $944 million in direct
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
medical costs for treating diabetes in
 
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and $319 million in
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
indirect costs attributed to diabetes
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
people with diabetes spend about 2.3
 
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
times more on medical expenses than
 
01:22:12.189 --> 01:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
those without
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
diabetes so glucose monitoring and
 
01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
glucose is just the medical word for
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
sugar blood sugar provides Insight on
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
the impact of all all the choices people
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
make that affect their blood sugars
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
their food intake their physical
 
01:22:27.639 --> 01:22:29.629 align:start position:0%
their food intake their physical
activity

01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
activity
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
medications there are actually about 25
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
variables that affect blood sugars and
 
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
blood sugars vary throughout the day so
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
the only way for a person with diabetes
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
to really know how they're doing and
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
taking care of their condition is to get
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
data to check their blood
 
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
sugar blood sugar checks are useful in
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
the morning or or whenever somebody has
 
01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
had their longest sleep when they're
 
01:22:58.270 --> 01:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
fasting which is often their lowest
 
01:23:01.229 --> 01:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
blood sugar but not always it's useful
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
prior to meals and snacks to know if
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
you're high before a meal you might
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
choose to eat differently than if you're
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
moderate before a meal you might
 
01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:10.709 align:start position:0%
moderate before a meal you might
medicate

01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
medicate
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
differently um similarly you might check
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
after meals to see how you did did you
 
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
make the right judgment can you learn
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
from that for the next time
 
01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
around at bedtime to be safe going into
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
hours of sleep in the middle of the
 
01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
night for some people with diabetes is
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
necessary prior to during and after
 
01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
exercise for the most part exercise
 
01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
lowers blood sugar but not always in
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
everybody it's not completely
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
predictable um monitoring is useful when
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
low blood sugar is suspected and after
 
01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
treating low bluc blood glucose levels
 
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure they've normalized it's
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
useful when you think you could be high
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
you cannot always tell by symptoms in
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
fact the longer you have diabetes the
 
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
less likely that you can tell that
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
you're dropping high or low by how you
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
feel that
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
is and it's useful prior to performing
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
critical tasks such as driving driving
 
01:24:06.669 --> 01:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
when your blood sugar is low makes you
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
behave like your DWI in fact people have
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
been pulled over and law enforcement
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
thought that they were under the
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
influence when in fact the reality was
 
01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
there a person with diabetes whose blood
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
sugar was too low for them to be safely
 
01:24:21.149 --> 01:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
driving which could happen rapidly they
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
could have been okay when they got
 
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
behind the
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
wheel so glucose monitoring is an
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
integral component of effective therapy
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
trying to treat diabetes without glucose
 
01:24:33.149 --> 01:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
monitoring is like driving without a
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
status the frequency of glucose
 
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
monitoring is individualized it depends
 
01:24:47.109 --> 01:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
on how that person's diabetes is being
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
treated how vulnerable they are to
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
unexpected low blood sugars whether
 
01:24:54.270 --> 01:24:54.280 align:start position:0%
there is a concurrent illness going on
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
that could be affecting blood sugars the
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
age of the individual how long they've
 
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
had diabetes there's a there's a lot of
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
variables that would dictate how
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
frequently a person would be recommended
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
to monitor their
 
01:25:08.669 --> 01:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
sugars so it could be anywhere from
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
somebody who's very stable with their
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
diabetes might be checking their sugar
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
once a day to a person with a lot of
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
variability in their blood sugars or a
 
01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
lot of variability in their
 
01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
lifestyle they might be checking sugar
 
01:25:25.709 --> 01:25:25.719 align:start position:0%
12 15 times a day to be
 
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
safe there are two approaches to blood
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
sugar monitoring commonly people prick
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
their finger to get a tiny drop of blood
 
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
it's applied to a test strip which is
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
then inserted into a glucometer to read
 
01:25:39.709 --> 01:25:39.719 align:start position:0%
the results takes about 30 seconds test
 
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
strips are single use only that's
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
important as I said people might test
 
01:25:48.669 --> 01:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
once a day or many times um even people
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
who are very knowledgeable about
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
managing their diabetes need monitoring
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
to be sure of what is going on it is
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
common for only a limited number of test
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
strips to be covered by Medicare and
 
01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
Commercial insurers to use an old cliche
 
01:26:07.109 --> 01:26:07.119 align:start position:0%
that is Pennywise and pound foolish
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
there are mechanisms for people to get
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
more test strips prescribed but it's
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
kind of a jumping through hoops Rodeo
 
01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
for someone who has a challenging
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
condition that takes a lot of their time
 
01:26:21.390 --> 01:26:21.400 align:start position:0%
and energy to effectively address to
 
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
also have to keep
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
documenting and getting a new script
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
from their provider to authorize the
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
insurer to provide them an adequate
 
01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
number of test strips it makes people
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
give up on bothering to test as often as
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
they ideally would it's just another
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
barrier in a complicated
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
scenario as you might expect pricking
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
your finger multiple times daily isn't a
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
particularly pleasant experience
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
although I will say G comers have
 
01:26:54.669 --> 01:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
improved enormously from when I started
 
01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
my career as a dietitian in
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
1979 the drop of blood is in fact tiny
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
the lanets are much narrower and I say
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
this in part for the public listening to
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
encourage people not to be intimidated
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
from doing that but it is still you're
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
you're perking your finger the TV
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
advertising notwithstanding we do not
 
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
have a way to test blood sugar that is
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
non-invasive it doesn't exist
 
01:27:21.149 --> 01:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
yet so dealing with blood and a little
 
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
bit of pain but a little bit of pain
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
multiplied times many episodes of that
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
makes it hard for people to check as
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
frequently as would be beneficial
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
continuous glucose monitoring is a
 
01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful alternative a CGM is a device
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
for measuring glucose levels continually
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
through a sensor that you wear and it
 
01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
slightly penetrates your skin when
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
applied they're about the size of a dime
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bigger they are designed
 
01:27:49.149 --> 01:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
to remain in place for at least 7even
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
days depending on the particular product
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
it may be 10 days
 
01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
real-time cgms send and display blood
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
sugars to a smartphone or receiver
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
automatically they really help people
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
understand the effects of their
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
lifestyle on blood sugar while I was
 
01:28:06.750 --> 01:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
still practicing I was frequently
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
impressed by the considerable increase
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
in understanding of diabetes when people
 
01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
CGM cgms are not new but they have not
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
been in the common lexicon for people to
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
use for diabetes until the last several
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
years near the end of my time in
 
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
practice one of the companies had a
 
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
program where you could get a sample CGM
 
01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
unit it would only work for I don't
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
remember now I think it was 10 days um
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
so that people could test out what it
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
would be like to wear a CGM and what
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
kind of information they would get from
 
01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
it it was such a pleasure as a provider
 
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
trying to help people take good care of
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
themselves to have this opportunity for
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
people to try it out and see how much
 
01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
they would
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
learn and I so clearly remember the
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
first person who sampled this working
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
with me and and many
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
following she was a woman in her
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
50s she really worked hard to take good
 
01:29:08.669 --> 01:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
care of her diabetes before the CGM but
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
it frankly wasn't going very well her
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
numbers were too high she was at risk
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
and she came in after that trial period
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
with the CGM and literally was euphoric
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
she said to me I have never understood
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
my d diabetes the way I understand it
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
now I want one of these forever and her
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
insurance company denied her
 
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
coverage because many insurance
 
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
companies will only cover cgms if the
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
patient needs to take insulin and this
 
01:29:39.310 --> 01:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
woman was not being treated with insulin
 
01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
budge uh lost my place here oh yes so
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
also cgms provide Trend info meaning
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
they indicate to the patient whether
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
their blood sugar is trending up or down
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
that is very helpful information in

making decisions about how much
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
medication you might take or whether to
 
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
take medication or should you have a
 
01:30:07.709 --> 01:30:07.719 align:start position:0%
snack before you go out and do a run so
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
that your blood sugar doesn't go too low
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
you get the idea of where things are
 
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:12.520 align:start position:0%

number

01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
is in fact one of my colleagues on the
 
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
house education committee which I hope
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
is going to break away I just realized I
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
was to remind him to come here wears a
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
continuous glucose monitor and we
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
occasionally hear it beep as he is
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
alerted of the trend of what is
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
happening with his blood sugar diabetes
 
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
is a balancing act trying to prevent
 
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
harmful high blood sugars while avoiding
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
overcorrecting and getting dangerously
 
01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
low blood sugars CGM is associated with
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
lower average blood sugars while
 
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
preventing unsafe flows less risk of
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
complications and fewer
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations people who have
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic hypoglycemia or nighttime
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemia that's low blood sugar are
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
much safer with CGM up to 75% of high
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
and low blood sugars go undetected
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
without CGM people don't know where
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
they're at because you simply aren't
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
going to prick your finger every five
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
minutes all day long even if you had an
 
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
unlimited Supply test strips no one
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
would do that all of the improvements
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
associated with using a CGM are reversed
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
if the CGM is discontinued which happens
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
all too frequently if if a patient
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
changes coverage people need continued
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
access regardless of age A1C level or
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
form of
 
01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
treatment I'm going to skip over the
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
next part here but you'll see in my
 
01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:35.950 align:start position:0%
next part here but you'll see in my
written

01:31:35.950 --> 01:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
testimony um the recommendations from
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
American Diabetes Association standards
 
01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
of care which were just updated this
 
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
month and the confirmation from the
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
endocrine Society American Association
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
of di of diabetes Educators and American
 
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
Association of Cl cl cl chronologists
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
all supporting what I am saying and I
 
01:31:59.790 --> 01:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
will go to the edited version of the
 
01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
bill because as you've seen the bill is
 
01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
long um it's a little bit duplicatus
 
01:32:06.669 --> 01:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
because the first half is about
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance and the second half
 
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
is about Medicaid coverage they're
 
01:32:12.270 --> 01:32:12.280 align:start position:0%
almost exactly the same it's just needed
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
to be put into statute for both um the
 
01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:19.719 align:start position:0%
same language so the summary of the
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
bill all continuous or traditional blood
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
cgos monitors and the necessary supplies
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
for any person with a diagnosis of
 
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
diabetes of any kind including Type 1
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
Diabetes Type 2 diabetes gestational
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
diabetes which is diabetes during
 
01:32:37.149 --> 01:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
pregnancy or any other type of diabetes
 
01:32:37.159 --> 01:32:38.030 align:start position:0%
pregnancy or any other type of diabetes
or

01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemia would be covered supplies
 
01:32:43.149 --> 01:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
include but are not limited to sensors
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
test strips the lanets to prick your
 
01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
finger alcohol wipes which you
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
need the bill would require coverage be
 
01:32:53.790 --> 01:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
provided without regard to the form of
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
treatment we now have a wide array of
 
01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
medications in the toolbox for diabetes
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
some are oral medications some are
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
injectable but are not
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
insulin and then there are a variety of
 
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
different kinds of insulin that have
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
different durations of
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
action the
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
right treatment for a patient is the one
 
01:33:20.109 --> 01:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
that gets them good blood sugar control
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's not one is preferable to another in
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
a broad stroke way so when our insurers
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
or Medicaid tie the availability of
 
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
glucose monitoring to one form of
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
treatment they're putting providers in
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
the position of saying well maybe we
 
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
should start you on insulin so you can
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
adequately monitor your bread sugars
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
when maybe insulin isn't the best way
 
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
for that person to be treating their
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
diabetes so I don't think that the
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
coverage should be tied to the form of
 
01:33:50.639 --> 01:33:52.270 align:start position:0%
coverage should be tied to the form of
treatment

01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
to qualify for continued coverage under
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
this RSA the recipient would need to
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
participate in follow-up care with their
 
01:33:59.950 --> 01:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
treating licensed Healthcare
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%

01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
Health at least once every 6 months
 
01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
during the first 18 months of the
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
glucose monitoring to assess the
 
01:34:10.510 --> 01:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
efficacy of using the monitor for
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
treatment of his or her diabetes and
 
01:34:14.669 --> 01:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
then after the first 18 months follow-up
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
care occurring a minimum of once every
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
12 months which is the standard of care
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
for diabetes anyway upon approval of new
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
or improved glucose monitoring devices
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
and Supplies by the Food and Drug
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
Administration all policies governed by
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
this section shall guarantee coverage of
 
01:34:33.149 --> 01:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
new diabetes equipment and supplies when
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
medically appropriate and prescribed by
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
a licensed healthc care practitioner
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
qualified to treat diabetes that section
 
01:34:42.189 --> 01:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
is from Rhode Island statute it is in
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
place and the intent of it is diabetes
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
research is substantial and ongoing and
 
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
we are evolving in the technology the
 
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
idea of that would be that we would not
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
have to come back to statute and say oh
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
now we have something better than the
 
01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
CGM that was in existence when the
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
statute was created that we would simply
 
01:35:02.669 --> 01:35:02.679 align:start position:0%
be able to respect the
 
01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art and authorize that
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
Care uh let's see and then
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
finally uh beginning
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
on proposed anyway July 1st 2024
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
coverage for gluc post monitoring
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
equipment and supplies shall have a
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
limit on the total amount that an
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
insured is required to pay for a 30-day
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
supply of all medically necessary
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
covered di diabetes devices that are in
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
accordance with their treatment plan at
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
an amount not to exceed $30 so a $30
 
01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
co-pay these devices shall be covered
 
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
without being subject to a deductible
 
01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
and any cost sharing paid by an insured
 
01:35:46.590 --> 01:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
shall be applied toward the insured's
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
deductible obligation nothing in this
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
section prevents an insurer from
 
01:35:53.470 --> 01:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
reducing an insured co-payment or co-
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
insurance without coverage cgms are in
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
the vicinity of $500 a month that is a
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
whopping sum of money especially added
 
01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
to the other costs of treating
 
01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
diabetes I'm going to pause here there
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
are other speakers who will provide you
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
more input and detail but I am happy to
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
try to answer questions if I can and I
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your interest
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
and attention representative
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
Speer so you listed a um how much money
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
diabetes is costing us in general and
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's pretty high but if a person keeps
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm I don't know anything too
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
much about diabetes but if a person
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
keeps their blood sugar nice and steady
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
can they expect to avoid a lot of the
 
01:36:43.229 --> 01:36:43.239 align:start position:0%
illnesses you talked about heart disease
 
01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
and kidney
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
failure so keeping it steady is very
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
very critical to avoiding much worse
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
situ situations thank you for the
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
excellent question and yes we have known
 
01:36:59.310 --> 01:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
since the I don't remember when this
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
study was I was in practice a long time
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
I want to say the late
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
80s that if you strictly control blood
 
01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
sugar and so you have the greatest
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
amount of what is called time in range
 
01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
so blood sugar is not a pinpoint it's a
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
range and if you are able to keep a
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
person's blood sugar in range most of
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
the time which is a lot really can't do
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
it without glucose monitoring we can
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
largely eliminate
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
complications there should be no reason
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
why any person diagnosed with diabetes
 
01:37:36.109 --> 01:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
today and effectively treating it would
 
01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
have an amputation or kidney
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
failure heart disease has a lot of
 
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
variables diabetes is the number one
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
cause of heart disease I'm not going to
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
guarantee I'm going to guarantee
 
01:37:49.629 --> 01:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
anything but I don't think we would
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
eliminate heart disease but we would
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
greatly greatly reduce it so yes
 
01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative spear the costs of
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
diabetes are very much related to how
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
well it's taken care
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
of represent
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chairman um I'm going
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
to ask a question that is based on what
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
was told me a long time ago by a friend
 
01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
with type 1 diabetes um and I'm not sure
 
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
that I understood correctly at the time
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
which is why I'm going to ask you this
 
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
question is there a device which
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
combines continuous glucose monitoring
 
01:38:33.390 --> 01:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
with um uh timed or continuous relief
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
release of insulin into the bloodstream
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
when it's
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
needed that's an excellent question
 
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so if anybody behind me wants
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
to update me because as noted I'm no
 
01:38:48.910 --> 01:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
longer in practice I think that device
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
is still only available in a research
 
01:38:56.189 --> 01:38:56.199 align:start position:0%
context so there are insulin pumps which
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
provide the part of Representative Gibbs
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
question of dispensing insulin they're
 
01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
programmable they're enormously
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
flexible that's a whole other topic in
 
01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
legislation perhaps for another day um
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
and there are continuous glucose
 
01:39:14.669 --> 01:39:14.679 align:start position:0%
monitoring devices a closed loop system
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
would put those two together I know that
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
there has been research at Mass General
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
and they trial them um well not to
 
01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
conflict me isn't this the invention
 
01:39:28.109 --> 01:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
Dean Cayman right I don't know and I
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
should obviously so so yes this product
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
is available and in is it out there in
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
the marketplace
 
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
yes wow cool I stand
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
corrected thank you represent
 
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
hunt I'm the last person in the will be
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
telling you this but but yes uh it's
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
right further question further question
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
may inquire
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
um if uh well apparently the the that um
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
device is now out in the
 
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
market if it is uh assuming that it is
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
bill there is no language in this bill
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
to address that
 
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
device I would think we would want to
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
put language in to prevent any
 
01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
ambiguity but send
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
my interpretation would be that device
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
is a continuous glucose monitor it
 
01:40:31.629 --> 01:40:31.639 align:start position:0%
happens to also be an insulin pump so I
 
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
would say yes so but but but based on
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
your testimony and again whether I was
 
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
paying attention or not your issue here
 
01:40:41.310 --> 01:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
is not for those people who are have
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
diabetes and and we getting insulin
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
tested your issue here is that the
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are not reimbursing
 
01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
for the test kits if the person doesn't
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
need insulin is that correct thank you
 
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
for the question to
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
clarify that is part of the intent of
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
this bill okay so all people with
 
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
diabetes regardless of whether they're
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
treated with insulin but certainly
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
including folks who are treated with
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
insulin should have access to the
 
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
glucose monitoring devices that work
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
well for them okay and I should just
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
note if you have a continuous glucose
 
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
monitor you also need to have a
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
traditional glucose monitor because
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
there are occasional circumstances that
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you don't want me to get in the
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
Weeds about that you would need to use
 
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
your traditional monitor as a backup to
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
the CGM got it okay next is I think
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
representa MCU and then represent Terry
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
bringing this important topic to us and
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
I respect all your work as a diabetic
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
educator that's tough work and great
 
01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
work um you probably remember the leango
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
model of surrounding those potential
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
diabetic patients with the best-in-class
 
01:41:57.070 --> 01:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
customer service and just sending anyone
 
01:42:01.149 --> 01:42:01.159 align:start position:0%
even remotely close to a 5.8 or whatever
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
A1C uh a glucose monitor and it worked
 
01:42:07.149 --> 01:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
wonderfully and they did it because they
 
01:42:09.629 --> 01:42:09.639 align:start position:0%
knew the health economics were solid the
 
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
payers knew that if we bought all these
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
send them out sent them out that it
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
would lower their bottom line elsewhere
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
and your question is so the qu the
 
01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
question is there is about
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
continuous monitoring you know Dexcom
 
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
freestyle Libre these devices that are a
 
01:42:29.709 --> 01:42:29.719 align:start position:0%
lot more expensive do the same Health
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
economics necessarily exist because you
 
01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
obviously still have to have a finger
 
01:42:36.189 --> 01:42:36.199 align:start position:0%
stick or maybe by the way there are
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
about four five uh n near infrared
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
devices that are completely non-invasive
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
now they're in various stages of
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
approval they're not widely used yet but
 
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of them out there
 
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
sensors and it's all n based so the
 
01:42:49.709 --> 01:42:49.719 align:start position:0%
question is do this does do the same
 
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
Health economics
 
01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:55.719 align:start position:0%
exist for the much more
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
expensive these these types of
 
01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
devices I guess that's my my question
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question thank you for
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
appreciating diabetes Educators you're
 
01:43:08.189 --> 01:43:08.199 align:start position:0%
right it's hard work it's also really
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
rewarding at times
 
01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
rewarding at times
anyway

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:10.890 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:43:10.890 --> 01:43:12.070 align:start position:0%
anyway
[Music]

01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't have an adequate answer to
 
01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:17.629 align:start position:0%
um I don't have an adequate answer to
your

01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
query and I've had difficulty trying to
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
find that
 
01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
data on any
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
scale so with respect if anybody else is
 
01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
able to weigh in on that that would be
 
01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
awesome great thank you I'm still trying
 
01:43:35.070 --> 01:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:36.589 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:43:36.589 --> 01:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
represent has a question yeah thank you
 
01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
uh you you referenc Rhode Island uh
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
Statute in your testimony uh can you
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
tell us how many states have uh
 
01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.510 align:start position:0%
tell us how many states have uh
legislation

01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh identical or similar to what you are
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
proposing here and then the second part
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
of my question is we will I'll be
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
hearing no doubt from insurance company
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives what has been the
 
01:44:11.470 --> 01:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
response to call for this type of of uh
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
treatment shall we say uh from insurers
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
such that you believe it's necessary to
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
bring this forth um as proposed
 
01:44:19.599 --> 01:44:21.270 align:start position:0%
bring this forth um as proposed
legislation

01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions the first
 
01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
one's easy um there are six states
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
unless any have passed legislation in
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
the last two months that I haven't
 
01:44:35.149 --> 01:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
caught up with um that do have
 
01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
legislation similar to this and this is
 
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
modeled after kind of a compilation from
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
those States uh Rhode Island
 
01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
Florida Washington State I want to say
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma but I'm not 100% certain and I
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
apologize for my vagueness on some of
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
this I have a newborn baby granddaughter
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
so I'm a little um pulled back and forth
 
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
in the last couple weeks it's okay if
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
you just get the the second question um
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
just follow up later please yeah we we
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
will have a subcommittee so if you can
 
01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
have that okay that's fine I can do that
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
be great thank you and then the second
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
part of the question so the second
 
01:45:12.159 --> 01:45:13.589 align:start position:0%
part of the question so the second
question

01:45:13.589 --> 01:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
is insurance coverage for I would say
 
01:45:19.589 --> 01:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
both traditional and continous glucose
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
monitors is in con
 
01:45:21.239 --> 01:45:22.750 align:start position:0%
monitors is in con
assistant

01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
um there are not a lot of patients who
 
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
have Commercial Insurance who can't get
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
any kind of monitor most people can get
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
a traditional monitor but maybe with
 
01:45:35.310 --> 01:45:35.320 align:start position:0%
limitations on the
 
01:45:38.589 --> 01:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
strips but it is not continuous glucose
 
01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
monitors are not routinely covered for
 
01:45:43.589 --> 01:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
people with type 2 diabetes which is 90%
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
of the diabetic population and that's
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
why why is it not covered are you is
 
01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
that the question right what are you
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
hearing from insurers such as that they
 
01:45:52.830 --> 01:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
won't they're not doing this or won't do
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
it well they they will testify so
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll well I'd like to hear
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
from her opinion yes well her her
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't have a good answer for
 
01:46:04.830 --> 01:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
that because it's perplexing to me I I
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
can't I can't wrap my head around why it
 
01:46:11.709 --> 01:46:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
sense a quick question about the bill
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
yeah representative pelli I have a thank
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
you I have a congratulations on your rug
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a quick question about
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
Bill specifically so is there the
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
technology is evolving every day so are
 
01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
these devices somehow approved so that
 
01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
insurers would have no ambig ambiguity
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
as to what devices should be covered my
 
01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up question is it just limited to
 
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
the devices and it's not um this bill
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about covering in
 
01:46:48.430 --> 01:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
insulin itself
 
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
correct so the first question um yes
 
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
they are all FDA approved um there
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
aren't all that many of them um but it
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
would be it does specify FDA approved
 
01:47:03.589 --> 01:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
devices and in the clause about you know
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
what's the latest and greatest it's
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
still FDA approved it's not experimental
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
we're not in any way asking for coverage
 
01:47:11.470 --> 01:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
of that sort I'm sorry remind me of the
 
01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:12.910 align:start position:0%
of that sort I'm sorry remind me of the
second

01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
question uh this is limited to the
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
devices and strips and equipment and um
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
not to the this is coverage for
 
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
prescription insulin drugs correct that
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
is correct this is entirely about
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring so that the patient with
 
01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
diabetes knows their status this bill is
 
01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
not at all about coverage of how you
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
would then address that status how
 
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
you're treating diabetes it's just about
 
01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
ongoing great thank you very much now is
 
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
is Nick here oh there he is
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you very
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.589 --> 01:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
day thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Nick
 
01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
Trana I am representative from Kean
 
01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:09.229 align:start position:0%
Trana I am representative from Kean
chesher

01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
chesher
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
one and uh I'm very pleased to be a
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of of this bill uh in part
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
because three years ago just over three
 
01:48:21.149 --> 01:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
years ago uh my son Henry is now thir
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
um he was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
he had a health emergency took him to
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
the emergency room in Kean then he ended
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
up spending the better part of the next
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
week in uh Pediatric Intensive Care uh
 
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon at at Dartmouth uh we have
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
gone on you know a long learning curve
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
and it's remarkable to me that over the
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
past even just three years the
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
availability of testing devices and
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
treatment has evolved so much uh and and
 
01:48:53.709 --> 01:48:53.719 align:start position:0%
it's been really heartening to see when
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
when Henry first came home after his
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
diagnosis he was for for some time I
 
01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
forget how long doing the uh the finger
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
sticking doing it several times a day
 
01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
this is particularly difficult um in an
 
01:49:08.830 --> 01:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
adolescent uh because of hormonal
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
changes and other chemical changes in
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
the body that can lead to spikes and
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
lows in kind of unpredictable ways and
 
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
so there was a lot of testing uh it's
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
especially true when you're talking
 
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
about children who are playing sports
 
01:49:24.629 --> 01:49:24.639 align:start position:0%
right so you have the Adolescent uh
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
hormones and chemical changes combined
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
with the effects of vigorous exercise on
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh and heat right also can can
 
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
exacerbate those things so uh he was
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of testing it's also uh an
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
issue during the school day right when
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
he would have to leave class frequently
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
he ended up if total the amount of time
 
01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
that he missed class because if he
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
started to feel low and he would have to
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
go to the nurse's office in order to be
 
01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
stuck in order to be tested it was a
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time that he would
 
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
be missing class uh he would be missing
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
chunk of his he'd have to eat his lunch
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
very quickly because part of his
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
lunchtime was taken up with going down
 
01:50:05.149 --> 01:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
to the nurse getting tested uh and then
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
having his lunch and often that meant
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
he'd have to eat lunch very very quickly
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
so um we were very thankful to have uh
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
that device uh and to be able to monitor
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
him but it was definitely a
 
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
challenge uh then he moved moved on to a
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
freestyle Libre some of you may be
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with this uh it was on his arm
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh and he could test it uh now not with
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
a finger stick but with a device that
 
01:50:31.950 --> 01:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
came with the freestyle libbre that he
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
could hold up to his phone and then or
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
hold up to the device uh and then
 
01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
eventually an app on his phone that was
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
really great because he uh not only
 
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have to stick his finger there
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
was always a backup for that in certain
 
01:50:47.790 --> 01:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances you still want to be able
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
to to do a direct blood test because
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
they're measuring things slightly
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
differently uh but one of the nice
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
things about that was that my wife and I
 
01:50:59.470 --> 01:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
could download apps on our phones so
 
01:51:02.109 --> 01:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
that when he tested his blood sugar at
 
01:51:04.510 --> 01:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
different times of day that he was able
 
01:51:07.149 --> 01:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
to we could see that on our phones it
 
01:51:09.790 --> 01:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
also tracked his blood sugar over the
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
course of of time and his uh uh
 
01:51:15.390 --> 01:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
specialist up at Dartmouth was able to
 
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
access that data and so you could get a
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
day by day week by week month by month
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
readout to see when highs occurred when
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
lows occurred and it allowed for
 
01:51:28.589 --> 01:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
adjustment which happened uh quite
 
01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
frequently as they said not uncommon as
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
I understand it with adolescent
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
diabetics so that was a really great
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction um it
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
malfunctioned I I don't want to say a
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
lot but enough that again finger
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
sticking was was quite common and then
 
01:51:47.310 --> 01:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
he would also always have to inject
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
himself so leaving the classroom for
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
example missing school time to go to the
 
01:51:54.669 --> 01:51:54.679 align:start position:0%
nurse's office to uh you know he could
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
test it himself but to get the injection
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
several times a day depending on where
 
01:51:59.950 --> 01:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
his blood sugar was still had to go to
 
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
the nurse's office so that didn't uh
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
that didn't go
 
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
away now he is on a Dexcom which is
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
really great this is a pump uh has
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
something in his arm and he has has the
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
pump which is really great for all of
 
01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:15.639 align:start position:0%
these things right so that uh it can
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
test uh regularly and it can provide
 
01:52:20.589 --> 01:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
regular uh injections at he needs them
 
01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
in order to keep his blood sugar in the
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate range it's great when he's
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
playing sports as you can imagine early
 
01:52:27.870 --> 01:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
on he wasn't thrilled about he's out on
 
01:52:30.069 --> 01:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
the baseball field and my wife and I can
 
01:52:31.950 --> 01:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
read his blood sugar level and we have
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
to go out there and tell him you know in
 
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
front of his friends like look you
 
01:52:37.390 --> 01:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
really need to come in so we can give
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
you a shot or you can get sugar or uh uh
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
get get something to eat Etc now all of
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
that is monitored he can take care of
 
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
that himself likewise uh in school he is
 
01:52:52.069 --> 01:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
able to manage that that uh himself uh
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
and also before he had the uh the Dexcom
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
he would have uh and I apologize I'm not
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
going to get the uh the names right but
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
he would have the fast acting insulin
 
01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
that he would take during the day but he
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
also had I think it was Humalog which is
 
01:53:09.390 --> 01:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
long lasting at night so that's it's a
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
separate uh prescription it's a separate
 
01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh drug uh that you would use in order
 
01:53:16.229 --> 01:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
to cover that overnight period we don't
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
have to do that anymore the continuous
 
01:53:20.589 --> 01:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
glucose monitor monitors that overnight
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
and if he gets low it provides him these
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
little uh doses boluses rather than
 
01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
larger uh units which is a much more
 
01:53:30.990 --> 01:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
effective way of of controlling uh his
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
blood sugar
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
overnight when we first were prescribed
 
01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:37.390 align:start position:0%
overnight when we first were prescribed
the

01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
Dexcom we got it approved H and then it
 
01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
just didn't come and it didn't come and
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
it didn't come and so we followed up I
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
spent numerous hours on the phone with
 
01:53:49.149 --> 01:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
our insurance company trying to
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
understand why
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
it turns out that our insurance company
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
had changed how they cover the Dexcom
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
had originally been under a prescrib
 
01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
prescription drug plan but they changed
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
it without telling us to durable medical
 
01:54:04.109 --> 01:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
supplies and they had just kind of
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
cancelled the order rather than telling
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
us that we needed to talk to our
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
physician get a new order put in you
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
know they said that's the other side of
 
01:54:13.149 --> 01:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
the company you know our computer
 
01:54:15.229 --> 01:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't talk to their computer so it
 
01:54:18.189 --> 01:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
took a long time to to to get it going
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
when it wasn't clear that insurance was
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
was going to cover it we were going to
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
pay for it ourselves because the the
 
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
benefits are really great uh we were
 
01:54:30.189 --> 01:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
looking at about $300 a month uh for
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
that in addition to other things that we
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
pay for monthly and uh this is a
 
01:54:38.589 --> 01:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
significant uh obviously significant um
 
01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
outlay I'm fortunate to have good
 
01:54:42.750 --> 01:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
insurance I have a good job I have good
 
01:54:45.870 --> 01:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
pay so it would have been not pleasant
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
for us to pay that uh in addition to all
 
01:54:49.229 --> 01:54:49.239 align:start position:0%
the other things that we have to pay for
 
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
but it would have been doable uh
 
01:54:54.030 --> 01:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
fortunately Insurance did end up um
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
everything got straightened out and now
 
01:54:57.629 --> 01:54:57.639 align:start position:0%
it's $40 a month as opposed to the 300
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
that we would have been spending in
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
addition to other costs so for us to do
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
that as I said it would not have been
 
01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
pleasant but it would have been possible
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
and we would have done it I can only
 
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
imagine you know the number of grand
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
estaters if we're looking at 6600 people
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
a year how many of those are children um
 
01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
who are not eligible for example for
 
01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but who are also you know would
 
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
really financially be put in a bind if
 
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
they're looking at $300 to $500 a month
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
just for that device uh in addition to
 
01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
the other costs that uh representative
 
01:55:32.910 --> 01:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
Damon spoke about that come along with
 
01:55:36.589 --> 01:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
with treating diabetes so um I won't I'm
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
happy to ask or answer rather any
 
01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions I wanted to share that as an
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
example of kind of the progression
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
particularly with a child with diabetes
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
and the importance of these devices and
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
how expensive they can be and uh and how
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
much it would mean for a lot of folks in
 
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
the granite state to make sure that they
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about either paying
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
that out of pocket or possibly not being
 
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
able to afford to do that in a
 
01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable way so thank you very much
 
01:56:05.470 --> 01:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
for hearing my
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Gibbs thank you
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
is the Dex Dexcom is that correct Dexcom
 
01:56:17.629 --> 01:56:17.639 align:start position:0%
that your son has um a combined device
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
that both monitors and ad ministers
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
medication when needed yes it is I thank
 
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
you for the question and and it was this
 
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
weird with the insurance one thing that
 
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
gets complicated is there's the pump
 
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
which actually our insurance company
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
said sure we'll cover that no problem
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
and it came in the mail but then you
 
01:56:36.069 --> 01:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
also need to get the cartridges that
 
01:56:38.910 --> 01:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
contain the insulin that go into the
 
01:56:40.589 --> 01:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
device and that's what they weren't
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
going to cover right so you can get the
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
pump free right but 300 bucks a month
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
for the cartridges uh that go into the
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
the pump so he does have one of those
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
devices that both monitors and then
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
administers okay represent
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
spear I don't know uh for sure if you
 
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
would know the answer to this
 
01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%
question your son is obviously on
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
insulin but if he if a person did not
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
require insulin would they have access
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
to any kind of monitoring at all through
 
01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:20.750 align:start position:0%
to any kind of monitoring at all through
insurance

01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that question
 
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representa M thank you Mr
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
chairman so just to clarify it's two
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
separate devices correct the Dexcom and
 
01:57:35.229 --> 01:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
then they integrate with at least one
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
that I know of Tandem I think but I
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
think perhaps others too so Dexcom is
 
01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
Dexcom CGM is CGM insulin pump is you
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
have a question now so I'm just trying
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
to clarify right clarify that because I
 
01:57:50.030 --> 01:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
think there's some confusion amongst
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
okay like what Dean came and invented
 
01:57:54.189 --> 01:57:54.199 align:start position:0%
which was just an insulin pump got it in
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
the 70s or something right it's an
 
01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:58.030 align:start position:0%
the 70s or something right it's an
integrated

01:57:58.030 --> 01:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
integrated
 
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
system okay two two separate devices
 
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
though right one's monitoring one's drug
 
01:58:06.030 --> 01:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
delivery yes they just talk to each
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
other electronically yes got it okay any
 
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
 
01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony thank you
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
very much Mr
 
01:58:16.510 --> 01:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
chairman okay so I think we got a good
 
01:58:18.189 --> 01:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
idea of what we're dealing with here so
 
01:58:20.189 --> 01:58:20.199 align:start position:0%
let's hear the insurance company's
 
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
position uh we'll start with
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
ahip and it is still morning barely good
 
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
Heidi C I work at Gallagher Callahan and
 
01:58:54.069 --> 01:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
gartell and I represent ahip which is um
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
America's health insurance plans or the
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
trade Association for the health
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers um so we um do have
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about the bill
 
01:59:07.069 --> 01:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
um I guess I would first um turn
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
people's attention to the Bill's fiscal
 
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.069 align:start position:0%
people's attention to the Bill's fiscal
note

01:59:13.069 --> 01:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
um which was prepared by the insurance
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
department um so it um explains what the
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
bill does and
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
um some flags that they have uh flagged
 
01:59:30.069 --> 01:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
for us um so as we've heard discussion
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
today um the bill does seek to um uh
 
01:59:36.189 --> 01:59:36.199 align:start position:0%
expand coverage for diabetes U
 
01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
monitoring supplies and equipment for
 
01:59:40.589 --> 01:59:40.599 align:start position:0%
individuals um with diabetes that do not
 
01:59:43.950 --> 01:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
currently use um insulin therapy um so
 
01:59:46.030 --> 01:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
it would increase the eligible
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
population for the service and as the
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
department indicates in their fiscal
 
01:59:52.350 --> 01:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
note um it would increase the eligible
 
01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
population um
 
01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:55.750 align:start position:0%
population um
significantly

01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
um the bill is also seeking to um uh cap
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
the insured uh cost share responsibility
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
to no more than
 
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
$30 um for a 30-day Supply um regardless
 
02:00:13.229 --> 02:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
of whether the patient has um met their
 
02:00:16.589 --> 02:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
deductible yet or not
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
um you know I think this is an important
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
Point um the costs don't go away uh the
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
costs would need to be picked up um
 
02:00:28.189 --> 02:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
elsewhere you know it's it's like a
 
02:00:29.950 --> 02:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
balloon if you squeeze the cost out of
 
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
one area they're going to have to go
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
into something else um so it would put
 
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
upward pressure on premiums um and or uh
 
02:00:41.709 --> 02:00:41.719 align:start position:0%
cause upward pressure on other uh cost
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
sharing co-pays um cost shares um for
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
other services um in the health plan um
 
02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
so the the department indicates in its
 
02:00:53.870 --> 02:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
um fiscal note that um you know the bill
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
would uh would increase the frequency
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
unit cost and total cost of claims the
 
02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.639 align:start position:0%
department expects the extent of this
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
increase to be non-trivial but
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
indeterminable at the time at this time
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
and um this may result in upward
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
pressure on premiums and and we would
 
02:01:12.589 --> 02:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
agree with that assessment
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
um I also would say that when you place
 
02:01:16.950 --> 02:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
a cap like this of
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
$30 um you are essentially given giving
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers of the equipment um no
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
incentive whatsoever to keep their
 
02:01:27.950 --> 02:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
prices affordable and so um the sky is
 
02:01:30.430 --> 02:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
the limit for them once you put in a cap
 
02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
like this where
 
02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
um insurance is basically paying you
 
02:01:37.629 --> 02:01:37.639 align:start position:0%
know the premium payers are basically
 
02:01:40.589 --> 02:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
paying um for anything above the
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
$30 um I also wanted to point out um
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
that the way the bill is drafted um this
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
would apply only to the um fully insured
 
02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
markets so the individual small group
 
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
and large group fully insured um so it's
 
02:01:57.870 --> 02:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
not applying to the self-funded market
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
which is about 34% of New Hampshire's
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
Insurance Market um the group the
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
employer sponsored market fully insured
 
02:02:07.709 --> 02:02:07.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 20 to
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
21% um the individual Market is um under
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
6% so this bill would Target you know
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the neighborhood of about
 
02:02:19.229 --> 02:02:19.239 align:start position:0%
28% of the insurance Market um putting
 
02:02:22.510 --> 02:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
aside Medicaid I'm not here to talk
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
about the Medicaid piece um so I just
 
02:02:27.950 --> 02:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to and the other um type of
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
carriers or insurance that would not be
 
02:02:32.669 --> 02:02:32.679 align:start position:0%
covered by this um are folks who have
 
02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:34.719 align:start position:0%
outof state employers who don't have
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar here in New Hampshire
 
02:02:39.069 --> 02:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
so if you're working either remotely um
 
02:02:40.709 --> 02:02:40.719 align:start position:0%
for an out of state company or you're
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
working you live in New Hampshire but
 
02:02:44.350 --> 02:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
you work in Massachusetts or Vermont or
 
02:02:48.149 --> 02:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
Maine um chances are that um that out of
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
state employer would not
 
02:02:51.550 --> 02:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
if if that's your situation you're out
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
of state employer would not be covered
 
02:02:56.589 --> 02:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
by this either um and I say that only
 
02:02:58.589 --> 02:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
because we have situations where we pass
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
mandates and then a year or so later
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
people come back and they complain we
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
passed the Mandate my insurance company
 
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
is's still not covering and it's because
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
your insurance company is not um you
 
02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
know the law does not apply to
 
02:03:12.199 --> 02:03:17.350 align:start position:0%
know the law does not apply to
them

02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.149 --> 02:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
um you know I think um in terms of
 
02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
coverage you know if we do have medical
 
02:03:26.430 --> 02:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
necessity requirements um so what
 
02:03:29.589 --> 02:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
carriers are doing applying in a fair
 
02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
and Equitable way is to apply the
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
medical necessity standards um so if
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's medically necessary it's covered um
 
02:03:40.189 --> 02:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
there just because something is covered
 
02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:41.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean a patient doesn't have a
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
cost share
 
02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
um uh the only services that are
 
02:03:49.950 --> 02:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
available without a cost share are ones
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
that are deemed um to be preventative
 
02:03:54.510 --> 02:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
Services Under the Affordable Care Act
 
02:03:55.589 --> 02:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
as you heard from the insurance
 
02:03:57.430 --> 02:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
department at the beginning of this um
 
02:04:00.030 --> 02:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
this goes beyond what's deemed under the
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act to be um
 
02:04:01.599 --> 02:04:04.030 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act to be um
preventative

02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
preventative
 
02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
Services um finally I'd say in a couple
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
of places here you'll see that um the
 
02:04:11.069 --> 02:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
bill would remove prior authorization we
 
02:04:12.750 --> 02:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
do have a concern with that prior
 
02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
authorization well not everybody likes
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
it um it's there for a reason it's there
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
um both provide um uh safety and kind of
 
02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
quality of care for the patient and it's
 
02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
also there to U make sure that we manage
 
02:04:32.189 --> 02:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
costs um also I did notice in the bill
 
02:04:34.830 --> 02:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
it requires the carrier must guarantee
 
02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
coverage of new diabetes equipment and
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
supplies as they come into the market
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
and again um new equipment t t tends to
 
02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
come with a high price tag um and so I
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
think what we' we would not want to take
 
02:04:50.189 --> 02:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
away the flexibility to make sure that
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're using equipment um that is um you
 
02:04:55.549 --> 02:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
know the most cost-effective available
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
and still doing the job so um we would
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
have a concern with that section as well
 
02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
and as you heard earlier from the
 
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
insurance department um the state would
 
02:05:08.030 --> 02:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility as drafted um for
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
additional costs under this there's the
 
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
cost of frail
 
02:05:14.350 --> 02:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
issue um and finally uh the effective
 
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
date is written as 60 days after passage
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
typically when we um require mandates um
 
02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
or have new mandate laws we at least try
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
to sync them up with the plan year um
 
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
which would be the first of a new
 
02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:29.310 align:start position:0%
which would be the first of a new
year

02:05:29.310 --> 02:05:29.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:05:32.109 --> 02:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
um and with that I will keep my remarks
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
short I don't want to stand between you
 
02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
and lunch I know there are other
 
02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
speakers well we do have questions here
 
02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
we'll start with representative Sullivan
 
02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I'm curious I don't
 
02:05:43.549 --> 02:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
think you really touched on do you or
 
02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
does the insurance industry have a
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
position on what the sponsor suggested
 
02:05:49.950 --> 02:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
which is this is kind of penny
 
02:05:52.109 --> 02:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
uh Pennywise and pound foolish in terms
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
of this would actually reduce overall
 
02:05:56.189 --> 02:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
costs I mean surely you guys have
 
02:05:58.069 --> 02:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
studied it or perhaps you haven't like
 
02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
it it what she said makes sense to me
 
02:06:01.549 --> 02:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
but what's your perspective yeah I and I
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
think you know Insurance like I said
 
02:06:05.549 --> 02:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers provide um follow
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
medical necessity guidelines those
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
medical necessity guidelines are uh
 
02:06:12.990 --> 02:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
continuously evolving um they are
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
developed um by um folks who are outside
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
of the insurance company they're you
 
02:06:21.790 --> 02:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
know developed by um experts in the
 
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
field looking at Best Practices you know
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
most current standards um and so my
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
understanding um and I'm not an expert
 
02:06:32.910 --> 02:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
on this but my understanding is that um
 
02:06:35.950 --> 02:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
that the continuous um monitoring is if
 
02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
you're on insulin then it's you know
 
02:06:41.470 --> 02:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
it's recommended or you know more likely
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
to be recommended if you're not then
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding is that it's not a
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
typical um
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
you know typically
 
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
recommended further question question um
 
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
so and then just I'm sympathetic to your
 
02:07:01.109 --> 02:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
point about the $30 cap I I see what
 
02:07:02.589 --> 02:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
you're saying it could lead to a higher
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
cost because the patient's only going to
 
02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
ever pay $30 of it uh if if this bill
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know goes further do you think it
 
02:07:15.069 --> 02:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
would be a better idea to do something
 
02:07:17.069 --> 02:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
like they pay a share 10% of it if the
 
02:07:19.030 --> 02:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
average price is 30 bucks
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
or if the average price is $300 10%
 
02:07:22.750 --> 02:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
would get us to
 
02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
$30 that way if you have a newer one
 
02:07:26.589 --> 02:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
coming online then a patient might have
 
02:07:28.270 --> 02:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
an incentive to say hey I don't want to
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
pay 10% of a high cost one but this
 
02:07:33.310 --> 02:07:33.320 align:start position:0%
other one which maybe isn't as techy but
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
it it will cause them to choose that
 
02:07:36.910 --> 02:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
basically because they're impacted by
 
02:07:39.229 --> 02:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
the price point right absolutely um
 
02:07:41.790 --> 02:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
would that be an amendment perhaps it
 
02:07:43.950 --> 02:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit more appealing to
 
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
the industry so I mean I think the way
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
things normally would work now is that
 
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
you know if there's
 
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
um when things are covered there's
 
02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
negotiated contracts whether it's a
 
02:07:57.229 --> 02:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
service or a piece of equipment so the
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
patient gets the uh advantage of the
 
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
negotiated price um until they've met
 
02:08:05.470 --> 02:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
their deductible and then once they've
 
02:08:06.750 --> 02:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
met their deductible they're either
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
paying a co-pay or a co- Insurance um
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
and you're right um insurance companies
 
02:08:14.430 --> 02:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
provi try to provide incentives for
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
people to use lower cost Alternatives
 
02:08:19.069 --> 02:08:19.079 align:start position:0%
that are equally effective
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
um because they are paying a co-pay or
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
co- insurance so you know typically um
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's incentives where you'll have a
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
lower co-pay if you're using something
 
02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's a lower cost and you try to
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
encourage you to go in that way in that
 
02:08:32.629 --> 02:08:32.639 align:start position:0%
way so I think that's actually how
 
02:08:35.149 --> 02:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
things are happening now so this cap
 
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
this cap of $30 would diverge yeah just
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
to be clear you know if you look in the
 
02:08:45.069 --> 02:08:45.079 align:start position:0%
bill where the print the $30 is current
 
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
law and like it for not for the new
 
02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
language obviously but for under the
 
02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
under the current statue and I would say
 
02:08:54.750 --> 02:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
it's I've been around long enough where
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
it originally was passed it was $100 and
 
02:08:59.870 --> 02:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
then we lower it to $30 and this is not
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
for the new group of people this is for
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
the insulin right now you can see right
 
02:09:06.109 --> 02:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
the $30 for insulin but this also
 
02:09:08.549 --> 02:09:08.559 align:start position:0%
proposes a $30 cap on the equipment
 
02:09:09.950 --> 02:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
exactly but I'm just saying the 30
 
02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
that's where the 30 comes from is that
 
02:09:14.669 --> 02:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
we actually statutorily required it for
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
insulin Reverend s
 
02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
spear oh there any actual
 
02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
Actuarial um information that indicates
 
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
if you have type one oh I don't even I'm
 
02:09:29.189 --> 02:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
not sure I would get it right the kind
 
02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't require insulin whichever
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
type that is I don't know what that
 
02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
is I I don't I'd have to look into that
 
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
oh sorry here's my question if you have
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
whatever type that is is there any
 
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
Actuarial information that
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
indicates how serious of one of these k
 
02:09:51.069 --> 02:09:51.079 align:start position:0%
kidney diseases or heart failures or any
 
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
of this are likely to
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
occur I can look into that I'm sure
 
02:09:58.910 --> 02:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
there is I mean insurance carriers don't
 
02:10:01.470 --> 02:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
want people having more expensive
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
episodes of care either I mean we're all
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
I think we all have the same goal of
 
02:10:08.430 --> 02:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
keeping people healthy so that they're
 
02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
um not getting sick not having to go to
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
the hospital you
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
know having other um more severe impacts
 
02:10:18.549 --> 02:10:18.559 align:start position:0%
but I I don't I'm not aware of that I'm
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
sure there's that information out there
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
I can can we get that information yeah
 
02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
so um I will tell you that uh as someone
 
02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
who has experience with uh type one
 
02:10:31.549 --> 02:10:31.559 align:start position:0%
which is juvenile um yes they often lose
 
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
limbs okay what I want to say is is that
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
um when we talk to a lobbyist who is not
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
a doctor is not a health care provider
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's hard to ask them these type of
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
questions so that they're they're uh we
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
can no there is no actual AR uh the the
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
end of the day it's always a good you
 
02:10:56.669 --> 02:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
know you hear the um that U so a lot of
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
juvenile that are very uh brittle uh
 
02:11:02.109 --> 02:11:02.119 align:start position:0%
they're just in terms of how bad and how
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
often they test and and and there are
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
some some you know how good they are on
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
maintaining in so yes um we we we over I
 
02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
I think juny blazedale was was a
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
juvenile diabetic and he lived as he was
 
02:11:17.470 --> 02:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
a Senator Senate State pres Senator
 
02:11:19.470 --> 02:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
president he lived for a very long time
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
so but some do not and it's it's all
 
02:11:25.750 --> 02:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
over the map okay representa Terry thank
 
02:11:29.549 --> 02:11:29.559 align:start position:0%
you um uh you referenced in the fiscal
 
02:11:31.870 --> 02:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
note you referenced us to the fiscal
 
02:11:35.229 --> 02:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
note and then I heard in your testimony
 
02:11:35.239 --> 02:11:36.270 align:start position:0%
note and then I heard in your testimony
you

02:11:36.270 --> 02:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:11:41.069 --> 02:11:41.079 align:start position:0%
indicate um costs non-trivial
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
indeterminant at the same time I believe
 
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
since you're representing um ahip that
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
this is a 50 state assoc Association and
 
02:11:50.910 --> 02:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
we have heard in testimony that there
 
02:11:53.310 --> 02:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
are six other states that have passed
 
02:11:56.189 --> 02:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
similar or identical legislation to that
 
02:11:58.950 --> 02:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
which is being proposed if you do not
 
02:12:01.629 --> 02:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
have the data readily available for us
 
02:12:04.589 --> 02:12:04.599 align:start position:0%
today would you supply this committee
 
02:12:07.709 --> 02:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
with experience uh data from the six
 
02:12:11.109 --> 02:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
states that have enacted such
 
02:12:13.589 --> 02:12:13.599 align:start position:0%
legislation so that we can begin to
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
gauge the fiscal impact of this uh
 
02:12:18.159 --> 02:12:19.189 align:start position:0%
gauge the fiscal impact of this uh
proposed

02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
legislation if it were to come into
 
02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:24.599 align:start position:0%
effect in some way shape or form here in
 
02:12:24.599 --> 02:12:25.350 align:start position:0%
effect in some way shape or form here in
New

02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and particularly with
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
respect to the effect that we we all
 
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that diabetes and we've
 
02:12:34.069 --> 02:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
heard today from the sponsor the
 
02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
diabetes has a cascading effect in terms
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
of deleterious consequences so that with
 
02:12:43.629 --> 02:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
respect to the data that would come to
 
02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
us through you from the Six States your
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the other Six States stes
 
02:12:52.270 --> 02:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
that one would one would
 
02:12:56.830 --> 02:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
surmise that there would be uh there
 
02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
there would be a reduction in the costs
 
02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:01.430 align:start position:0%
there would be a reduction in the costs
of

02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:03.270 align:start position:0%
of
insurance

02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:13:05.830 --> 02:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
payouts uh on the basis of the fact that
 
02:13:08.189 --> 02:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
the diabetes would be better
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
controlled so could you do that for us I
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
will I will I'm happy to look in to see
 
02:13:15.229 --> 02:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
what information is available from other
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
states I would think that's critical for
 
02:13:19.470 --> 02:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
us critical I don't know what available
 
02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
what data is available but I will look
 
02:13:22.589 --> 02:13:22.599 align:start position:0%
forward it that's going to be pretty
 
02:13:24.430 --> 02:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
tricky day because the problem is people
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
don't stick with the same insurance
 
02:13:27.709 --> 02:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
company all the way through so it's hard
 
02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
to to collect that I would ALS I would
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
also say that from what I from what that
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
that would be a tough one to so Mr is
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
this a matter if we don't know until we
 
02:13:37.549 --> 02:13:37.559 align:start position:0%
know because we can't know until we know
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
u i I'll take this moment to say chair
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
would everybody maybe or did not hear
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
from what the department said right out
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
of the get-go which is that um that this
 
02:13:50.910 --> 02:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
bill would require us to do a financial
 
02:13:53.709 --> 02:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
analysis and uh and that would take a
 
02:13:55.870 --> 02:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
year so no matter what we do this bill
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
is cannot pass this year it will go to
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
interm study in which the department
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
will do its study its economic impact
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
study uh because we need to know what
 
02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
the and then so next year uh when when
 
02:14:12.669 --> 02:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
the sponsor reintroduces the bill again
 
02:14:15.310 --> 02:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
at that point it will have an actual
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation that it's going to cost
 
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
the state to
 
02:14:23.549 --> 02:14:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
reelected I would ALS yeah I agree with
 
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
what you're um with what the insurance
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
department said about the the Mandate
 
02:14:31.470 --> 02:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
review and then the other piece of this
 
02:14:34.189 --> 02:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
is the Medicaid piece um the Medicaid
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
the Medicade is that's the state going
 
02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
to have to come up cough up with that
 
02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:39.470 align:start position:0%
to have to come up cough up with that
money

02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much all right so
 
02:14:43.629 --> 02:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
one we just go to the insurance
 
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
companies and let's get them out of the
 
02:14:47.310 --> 02:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
way and then we'll have just the people
 
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
who are in supp support of the bill so
 
02:14:50.830 --> 02:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
next up is
 
02:14:57.549 --> 02:14:57.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:59.589 --> 02:14:59.599 align:start position:0%
anthm thank you chairman hunt and
 
02:15:01.549 --> 02:15:01.559 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Sabrina
 
02:15:03.629 --> 02:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
Dunlap Dunlap I'm director of government
 
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
relations at
 
02:15:07.709 --> 02:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
Anthem um and I just wanted to know I
 
02:15:09.629 --> 02:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
have family members and very dear family
 
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
friends who deal with type 1 diabetes so
 
02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
I very much appreciate the sensitivity
 
02:15:18.629 --> 02:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
um of and importance of this topic so we
 
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
we do have concerns with how broad the
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
bill is I won't repeat what Heidi said
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
but um I spoke with our medical director
 
02:15:27.629 --> 02:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
and he found this very concerning
 
02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
because his read on this language is
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
that this would open it up these devices
 
02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
to all patients even where not
 
02:15:37.709 --> 02:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate um and he noted that there
 
02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
are specialty societies that do not
 
02:15:42.270 --> 02:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
recommend the use of these devices in
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
all patients with type two diabetes I
 
02:15:48.270 --> 02:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
believe that in the fiscal note um the
 
02:15:51.069 --> 02:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
American Association of clinical
 
02:15:54.790 --> 02:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
Endocrinology is cited um and I I can I
 
02:15:56.069 --> 02:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
can follow up with our medical director
 
02:15:57.870 --> 02:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
to get the other specialty societies
 
02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
that do not recommend the devices for
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
all type two
 
02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
diabetes um
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
so I think you know just the breadth of
 
02:16:10.589 --> 02:16:10.599 align:start position:0%
this um and in just sort of opening the
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
doors where the devices might not be
 
02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
clinically appropriate um is probably
 
02:16:17.310 --> 02:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
the most concerning issue I would also
 
02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
just know I know Heidi touched on this a
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
little bit but we do often hear
 
02:16:23.549 --> 02:16:23.559 align:start position:0%
confusion about coverage versus cost
 
02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
share and as as Heidi noted you know if
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
something's medically necessary it's
 
02:16:30.589 --> 02:16:30.599 align:start position:0%
going to be covered um and just because
 
02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
someone has a co-pay and they're paying
 
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
money they might think well this isn't
 
02:16:35.589 --> 02:16:35.599 align:start position:0%
covered but it actually is and then you
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
get into you know benefit design and the
 
02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
type of plan that you have um so anyway
 
02:16:42.549 --> 02:16:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh I'm happy to take any questions but
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
today and this and this is a real
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
question not a not a little would you
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:59.309 --> 02:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you for coming for Anthem
 
02:17:02.190 --> 02:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
how many type one patients do you cover
 
02:17:04.110 --> 02:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if it was limited to
 
02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
type one so how many so I already know
 
02:17:07.950 --> 02:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
the your claims experience in
 
02:17:09.389 --> 02:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so I know what it would
 
02:17:10.830 --> 02:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
cost but I just don't know how many type
 
02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
one you have I do not know that off the
 
02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
top of my head but I could try to look
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
into that I'm I'm not sure that
 
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
something I could answer type one or
 
02:17:21.309 --> 02:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
covered now this is really a type two
 
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
War for type two or people who are have
 
02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
high a you know do we already we already
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
mandate coverage for for type one CGM uh
 
02:17:31.870 --> 02:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
read the read the the print in the bill
 
02:17:32.990 --> 02:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
I didn't think it was I think it was
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
read read stuff that's not bold faac
 
02:17:37.309 --> 02:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
believe you me we've had this bill
 
02:17:39.509 --> 02:17:39.519 align:start position:0%
several time this I don't think cdms are
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
mandated no CMS are not that's and
 
02:17:44.910 --> 02:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
that's the bill right so so so the
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
followup is if how many cg1 out there
 
02:17:51.070 --> 02:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
how many type ones so it's about 5% 5 to
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
10% of the total diabetic po population
 
02:17:56.030 --> 02:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
there's a 100,000 give or take diabetics
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so it's really about
 
02:17:59.870 --> 02:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's under 10,000 I just want to know
 
02:18:02.309 --> 02:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
how many Anthem has oh right and they
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
get they cost them about4 to $6,000
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
those numbers right what's that I didn't
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
say anything I said it's
 
02:18:13.429 --> 02:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
proprietary they're not going to tell us
 
02:18:16.349 --> 02:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
how many patients they
 
02:18:19.070 --> 02:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
have okay
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
thank representative
 
02:18:25.589 --> 02:18:25.599 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um shouldn't the
 
02:18:29.790 --> 02:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
question of who needs uh a continuous uh
 
02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:30.950 align:start position:0%
question of who needs uh a continuous uh
glucose

02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
glucose
 
02:18:36.030 --> 02:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
monitor be answered by uh the individual
 
02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
patient's doctor based on the individual
 
02:18:43.070 --> 02:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
patients needs and not by uh the
 
02:18:45.469 --> 02:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
recommendations the general
 
02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations of a society of
 
02:18:50.509 --> 02:18:50.519 align:start position:0%
Specialists well thank you for the
 
02:18:53.389 --> 02:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
question I'm not a medical professional
 
02:18:55.070 --> 02:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
so I mean I assume that is the current
 
02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
state though that that is how the system
 
02:18:59.549 --> 02:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
works is that a provider makes a
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh hopefully in
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
accordance with accepted guidelines and
 
02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
all carriers do our reviews and our
 
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
medical directors all work under widely
 
02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
accepted medical guidelines as
 
02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
well perfect thank you very much all
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
right Peter you're the last one Harvard

Pilgrim I'm shocked I would think a
 
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:32.110 --> 02:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
things thank you Mr chairman members of
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
the committee second day in a row I've
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
had the pleasure of paying you a visit
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm Peter bragon for the record
 
02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
um a senior policy adviser with predy
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
strategies also a recovering House and
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
Senate member um here representing
 
02:19:48.190 --> 02:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
Harvard PGM Healthcare as the chairman
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned Harvard Pilgrim is a not
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
for-profit health insurance company the
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
only uh not for-profit health insurance
 
02:19:55.070 --> 02:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
company in the state covering the
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
individual and group markets um and in
 
02:20:01.710 --> 02:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
saying that um part of that is we don't
 
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
have shareholders to answer to we're not
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
trying to make money for people what
 
02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking for is what is the best
 
02:20:09.070 --> 02:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
long-term solution so one of the prior
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
questions had to do with well don't you
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
look down the road to see if you solve
 
02:20:14.670 --> 02:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
this problem now then you don't have
 
02:20:16.190 --> 02:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
this problem later on and certainly that
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
something we look at all the time time
 
02:20:19.710 --> 02:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare currently
 
02:20:21.630 --> 02:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
covers continuous long-term glucose
 
02:20:24.190 --> 02:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
monitoring devices uh the coverage
 
02:20:26.790 --> 02:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
criteria is based on medical necessity
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
and the medical necessity is not
 
02:20:30.790 --> 02:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
something that the board of directors of
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
Harvard gets together people who are
 
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
just you know nothing about medical
 
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
issues and make some decision we have
 
02:20:40.510 --> 02:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
panels of Medical Specialists who review
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
all the available literature uh and in
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
the case of glucose monitoring devices
 
02:20:48.030 --> 02:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh the sources we use for for our
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
medical necessity criteria are the
 
02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
American Association of clinical end
 
02:20:55.309 --> 02:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
Endocrinology Who currently recommends
 
02:20:57.309 --> 02:20:57.319 align:start position:0%
glucose monitor devices for individuals
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with type 1 diabetes um and
 
02:21:02.110 --> 02:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
those diagnosed with type two uh who
 
02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
also use insulin therapy also the
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
sources we use are the American di
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
Diabetes Association uh the 2023
 
02:21:12.190 --> 02:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
standards of care uh it was mentioned
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
earlier they've just updated that
 
02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
obviously we regularly update um our
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
medical criteria based on the latest um
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
criteria from the groups that understand
 
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
these issues the best and obviously if a
 
02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
provider requests something that doesn't
 
02:21:30.429 --> 02:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
fit within our medical guidelines um
 
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
then there is an appeal process if it
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit in to make an explanation as
 
02:21:36.510 --> 02:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
to why the provider thinks that these
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
other groups may be wrong on an issue so
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
it's not just uh uh on a whim that these
 
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
decisions are made um let's see I'll
 
02:21:49.070 --> 02:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
point out uh uh Heidi mentioned that
 
02:21:50.590 --> 02:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
these types of bills and I should say
 
02:21:52.270 --> 02:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
Let Me Take A a step back as well
 
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a number of bills
 
02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to see this year and you're
 
02:21:56.910 --> 02:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
going to hear me several times uh
 
02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
Express concerns about them uh bills
 
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
that basically say we don't that neglect
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
medical necessity that we should do
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
various things for various other reasons
 
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
other than medical reasons and those may
 
02:22:14.349 --> 02:22:14.359 align:start position:0%
all be well and good policy decisions
 
02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
but you have to understand that's a
 
02:22:17.389 --> 02:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
slippery slope you go down there's going
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
to be bills on Prosthetics on
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
infertility treatments on blood uh lead
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
testing uh there's this bill here that
 
02:22:27.070 --> 02:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
basically says uh no medical necessity
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
required at all just do this so that's a
 
02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
that's a concern overall because those
 
02:22:34.910 --> 02:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
costs have to go somewhere and they're
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
going to go to the people who pay the
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
premiums and we all know that insurance
 
02:22:40.510 --> 02:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
premiums are high enough I pay my own
 
02:22:42.030 --> 02:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums they're high enough
 
02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
the way it is uh all these types of
 
02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
things are going to increase the
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
pressure on those as well as bills like
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
this one that uh take away any cost
 
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
sharing or at least try to limit the
 
02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
cost sharing of the subscriber so
 
02:22:57.150 --> 02:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
basically that means it's going to go to
 
02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
the premiums so um our view is as a not
 
02:23:02.590 --> 02:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
for-profit is we want to make it so the
 
02:23:04.349 --> 02:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
premiums are affordable so as many
 
02:23:06.590 --> 02:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
people in companies can have this as
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
possible um and so we're dealing with uh
 
02:23:13.469 --> 02:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
the issue of only 20% as Heidi said of
 
02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
the um Employers in the state or people
 
02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
in the state would be covered by the
 
02:23:20.429 --> 02:23:20.439 align:start position:0%
fully insured plans let me also point
 
02:23:22.429 --> 02:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
out that that means it doesn't include
 
02:23:24.750 --> 02:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
state employees why do we pass all these
 
02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
State mandates to cover various things
 
02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
but say oh but the state won't have to
 
02:23:30.190 --> 02:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
pay for this for this employees it
 
02:23:31.710 --> 02:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't also doesn't cover the cities
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
and towns and school districts in
 
02:23:35.469 --> 02:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which are covered by RSA 5B as
 
02:23:37.790 --> 02:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
risk pools why don't we mandate that
 
02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
they cover this as well if we really
 
02:23:41.590 --> 02:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about covering these things we
 
02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
should make that a part of the Mandate
 
02:23:47.429 --> 02:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
as well uh let's see this bill would as
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
I uh indicated uh override medical
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
criteria require coverage of glucose
 
02:23:54.429 --> 02:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
monitoring devices and supplies to in
 
02:23:56.269 --> 02:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
individuals diabetes that do not
 
02:23:59.309 --> 02:23:59.319 align:start position:0%
currently use insulin therapy um and for
 
02:24:01.469 --> 02:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
whom a continuous glucose monitor may
 
02:24:04.429 --> 02:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
not be medically necessary uh the fiscal
 
02:24:07.230 --> 02:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
note indicates there are only
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
575 uh people I believe in the state
 
02:24:13.389 --> 02:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
that currently under the commercial
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
insurance Market that have glucose
 
02:24:17.950 --> 02:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
marting devices um the testimony
 
02:24:19.630 --> 02:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
indicated there's close to 100,000
 
02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
people in the state that may have
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
diabetes or that's the ones diagnosed um
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
so if you make this available to
 
02:24:28.910 --> 02:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
everybody then just consider what that
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
will do to the price uh that people have
 
02:24:34.469 --> 02:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
to pay for their premiums um I guess
 
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
that's the basic thing is there's
 
02:24:37.830 --> 02:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
medical criteria out there they are not
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
developed on a whim they're not just
 
02:24:42.070 --> 02:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
throwing darts at a wall we use these
 
02:24:43.950 --> 02:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
professional organizations that
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
understand these diseases and their
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
causes and their treatments and the
 
02:24:50.269 --> 02:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
ramifications thereof uh to make
 
02:24:52.389 --> 02:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations on what's appropriate so
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
that we can be the best fiscal stewards
 
02:24:56.990 --> 02:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the premium dollars that we have I'd
 
02:24:58.269 --> 02:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions thank
 
02:24:59.630 --> 02:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
02:25:03.269 --> 02:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
Mr okay represent Terry thank you so one
 
02:25:05.269 --> 02:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
of the states that was identified that
 
02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
had uh that has uh enacted this
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
legislation is Rhode Island I presume
 
02:25:12.349 --> 02:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's within your uh your business uh
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
territory I made a note represent a
 
02:25:16.349 --> 02:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
check on uh what's so I was wondering if
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
you would uh check and get back to us on
 
02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
the experience that Harvard Pilgrim has
 
02:25:23.950 --> 02:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
had because yes it makes sense that that
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
premiums would initially increase to
 
02:25:28.590 --> 02:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
cover these additional shall we call
 
02:25:30.309 --> 02:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
them benefits for the lack of a better
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
term right now um but then we've also
 
02:25:35.269 --> 02:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there are net gains in
 
02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
terms of the reduction of costs to have
 
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
to pay for other conditions because the
 
02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
blood glucose is being controlled within
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
an appropriate range so if you could get
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
if you could get that data from Rhode
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
Island to us we'd appreciate it yes
 
02:25:51.269 --> 02:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
thank you represent I did make a note of
 
02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
not indal all the states being curious
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
but rhod Island obviously in the New
 
02:25:57.269 --> 02:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
England area be representative Gibs
 
02:25:59.429 --> 02:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'm going to ask you a
 
02:26:01.750 --> 02:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
question similar to the one that I asked
 
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
the anthem representative and that is
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't the question of medical
 
02:26:09.750 --> 02:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
necessity for an individual patient be
 
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
answered by that patient physician based
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
on the individual patients needs and not
 
02:26:16.399 --> 02:26:17.309 align:start position:0%
on the individual patients needs and not
by

02:26:17.309 --> 02:26:17.319 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
a pattern uh I'm sorry not by a panel of
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
medical experts uh making a general
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation or by a society of
 
02:26:29.950 --> 02:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
experts making a general recommendation
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
because as I'm sure you're aware um uh
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
needs of individ individual patients uh
 
02:26:38.389 --> 02:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
vary thank you for the question I
 
02:26:40.389 --> 02:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the concern I guess
 
02:26:41.630 --> 02:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
I would say as I pointed out that
 
02:26:43.269 --> 02:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
there's an appeal process so if a
 
02:26:45.389 --> 02:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
provider for some reason thinks that the
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
American Diabetes associate
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't know what they're talking
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
about or is misunderstanding a certain
 
02:26:52.750 --> 02:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
issue they can bring that before the
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
panel but for a vast majority of cases
 
02:26:58.870 --> 02:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
um these guidelines present what the
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
experts think should be done but there
 
02:27:02.269 --> 02:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
is a way to bypass that if someone
 
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
thinks they uh decision needs to be made
 
02:27:07.269 --> 02:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
outside of those recommendations but
 
02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
these groups spend full time studying
 
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
the best treatment for these uh diseases
 
02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:14.349 align:start position:0%
the best treatment for these uh diseases
and

02:27:14.349 --> 02:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
conditions representative Herbert um I'm
 
02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
not sure you know the answer to this but
 
02:27:22.670 --> 02:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask anyway the um is there
 
02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
any um in terms of federal funds is
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
there any interaction here
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
whereas uh some of the the federal
 
02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
government under Medicaid or Medicare or
 
02:27:36.990 --> 02:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
some program would uh also chip in in
 
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
order to pay pay these bills is there
 
02:27:41.389 --> 02:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
any access that way thank you for the
 
02:27:42.349 --> 02:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
question certainly part of this bill
 
02:27:43.830 --> 02:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
deals with Medicaid and that obviously
 
02:27:45.150 --> 02:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
would uh have a lot of federal
 
02:27:47.710 --> 02:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
interaction but to my understanding at
 
02:27:49.990 --> 02:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
least on the commercial insurance side
 
02:27:51.870 --> 02:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
individual and small group Market I
 
02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
02:27:59.870 --> 02:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
Sullivan so when you talk about the
 
02:28:02.349 --> 02:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
panel that helps set up these guidelines
 
02:28:04.349 --> 02:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
can you tell us who's on these panels do
 
02:28:07.269 --> 02:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
they include a wide range of people or
 
02:28:08.309 --> 02:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question I can
 
02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
get you information on kind of the the
 
02:28:11.910 --> 02:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
types of people that are on this uh
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
there uh I I most insurance companies
 
02:28:15.429 --> 02:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
probably work the same way there was a a
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
medical director that over sees the
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
entire thing and then uh then panels of
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
other medical professionals with
 
02:28:24.030 --> 02:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
specialty or expertise or at least
 
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge in these areas uh to make
 
02:28:27.349 --> 02:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations but I can get you some
 
02:28:29.469 --> 02:28:29.479 align:start position:0%
better information on that and you know
 
02:28:33.230 --> 02:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
obviously medical necessity is um a term
 
02:28:34.830 --> 02:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
that for those of us who've been on this
 
02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
committee a long time are acutely aware
 
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
so I think I might uh have the
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
department come in and make a little bit
 
02:28:44.269 --> 02:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
of a presentation explain how uh the
 
02:28:46.030 --> 02:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
medical director how the process that
 
02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:47.230 align:start position:0%
medical director how the process that
occurs

02:28:47.230 --> 02:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
02:28:50.269 --> 02:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of these decisions and and
 
02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
but but I will reemphasize what he just
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
said is is that if the doctor does
 
02:29:00.269 --> 02:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
prescribe and the insurance company will
 
02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
say no we won't do won't do it if the
 
02:29:04.469 --> 02:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
doctor really does believe that this
 
02:29:07.150 --> 02:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
patient is appropriate is um uh the
 
02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislation which I sponsored I was
 
02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
going to say who sponsored that
 
02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislation we have the uh external
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
review process uh that in a timely
 
02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
fashion will address the issue and and I
 
02:29:20.910 --> 02:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
and I my understanding is the external
 
02:29:24.030 --> 02:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
review has been very successful for
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
patients thank you very much thank you
 
02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay we have uh five cards left um and I
 
02:29:33.309 --> 02:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
would just say to all of you uh you
 
02:29:35.269 --> 02:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
stand between us and lunch and you know
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
how important getting our lunch is right
 
02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
so um I I have some cards like 10
 
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
minutes please please let's try to focus
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
on making a point that has not not been
 
02:29:49.269 --> 02:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
made already you know that's all I can
 
02:29:58.590 --> 02:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
arjal thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
Janan archabald I am the director of
 
02:30:06.590 --> 02:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
policy and government Affairs for on Sky
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
Community Services um we are an agency
 
02:30:09.950 --> 02:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
that Services individuals with
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and acquired
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
brain disorders I usually come before
 
02:30:15.790 --> 02:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
committees and speak on behalf of the
 
02:30:17.710 --> 02:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
families um to tell their stories but
 
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
today I can speak on my own story um 12
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
years ago my daughter was diagnosed with
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
type 1 diabetes we lived here in New
 
02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um they weren't able to care
 
02:30:28.910 --> 02:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
for her here so they airlifted her down
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
to Boston where she was um placed in the
 
02:30:35.469 --> 02:30:35.479 align:start position:0%
ICU for a while and at the time um
 
02:30:37.469 --> 02:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
people came out and said we're five
 
02:30:40.230 --> 02:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
years from a cure and
 
02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
so and I was sitting out in the lobby
 
02:30:44.830 --> 02:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
one day and the old older doctor came by
 
02:30:46.630 --> 02:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
and he said how you doing said I said
 
02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
I'm fine we at 5 Years From a cure and
 
02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:49.710 align:start position:0%
I'm fine we at 5 Years From a cure and
he

02:30:49.710 --> 02:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
he
 
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
said I'm going to give you some advice
 
02:30:54.030 --> 02:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
he goes we've been 5 Years From a cure
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
for as long as I've been around he goes
 
02:30:58.389 --> 02:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
in the absence of a cure technology will
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
keep your daughter alive so that's all I
 
02:31:04.110 --> 02:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
needed to hear at the time 12 years ago
 
02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
there wasn't as much technology
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
available as there is today cgms were
 
02:31:10.510 --> 02:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
not um available for Pediatric use at
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
the time so I've lived before the day of
 
02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
CGM and after the day of CGM and I can
 
02:31:18.389 --> 02:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
tell you um before these devices were
 
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
available what life was like 10 times a
 
02:31:22.750 --> 02:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
day minimum for insurance coverage and
 
02:31:25.389 --> 02:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
for our endocrinologist so that meant me
 
02:31:27.269 --> 02:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
getting up two three times in the middle
 
02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
of the night by her bedside pricking her
 
02:31:32.070 --> 02:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
finger if her blood sugar was low I'd
 
02:31:33.630 --> 02:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
spend the night on the floor testing her
 
02:31:35.190 --> 02:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
every 20 minutes to make sure she was
 
02:31:37.510 --> 02:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
safe to go to sleep every morning she
 
02:31:38.870 --> 02:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
would wake up and I would say a prayer
 
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
saying thank God she woke up this is the
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
life that I led before cgms she played
 
02:31:45.870 --> 02:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
track anything as one of the
 
02:31:47.349 --> 02:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
representatives just said would affect
 
02:31:50.110 --> 02:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
her blood sugar heat exercise and
 
02:31:51.550 --> 02:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not immediate it could be
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
4 hours later so she in the middle of
 
02:31:55.230 --> 02:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
the night she would get a low for after
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
running track that day so we didn't
 
02:31:59.950 --> 02:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
sleep much we ate a lot of um grilled
 
02:32:01.710 --> 02:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
cheeses at 3: in the morning trying to
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
keep her safe and healthy I quit my job
 
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
to go to school um so I could be with
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
her at school so I could go on field
 
02:32:09.429 --> 02:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
trips to help her so the nurse wouldn't
 
02:32:11.269 --> 02:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
be overburdened with just her care it
 
02:32:14.830 --> 02:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
was that much work um then cgms were
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
approved and this is a life Cher it made
 
02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
all the difference in the world and if
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
you don't know what they are I brought
 
02:32:24.790 --> 02:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
one and they've changed forms over the
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
last 12 years they've gotten better
 
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
every year you can wear them longer
 
02:32:30.510 --> 02:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
they're smaller this is the device that
 
02:32:32.910 --> 02:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
goes on her body it's just little tiny
 
02:32:35.349 --> 02:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
transmitter and this is the sensor that
 
02:32:37.870 --> 02:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
inserts it so this puts a base in her
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
stomach where she plugs this in it goes
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
to a Bluetooth connection to her phone
 
02:32:45.910 --> 02:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
and it also goes to my phone so I can
 
02:32:47.429 --> 02:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
watch or whoever's phone that she wants
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
to put it on and what we do is she's at
 
02:32:51.910 --> 02:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
college now which is terrifying if
 
02:32:55.389 --> 02:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
you're a parent of a diabetic um so she
 
02:32:57.630 --> 02:32:57.640 align:start position:0%
keeps you can set the alert she says
 
02:32:59.950 --> 02:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
okay if my blood sugar gets below 100 it
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
it alerts now it doesn't only alert at
 
02:33:05.150 --> 02:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
that threshold but if she's crashing for
 
02:33:07.870 --> 02:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
some reason and and it will tell you
 
02:33:09.469 --> 02:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
you're you're crashing hard so you can
 
02:33:09.479 --> 02:33:10.510 align:start position:0%
you're you're crashing hard so you can
do

02:33:10.510 --> 02:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:33:12.830 --> 02:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
proactive administration of your blood
 
02:33:15.870 --> 02:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
sugars and so I set mine 20 points lower
 
02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
than hers so if she hits 70 I know that
 
02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
she's in trouble and I call her and then
 
02:33:23.790 --> 02:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
I call her boyfriend and then I call her
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
friends and then I call the police so
 
02:33:27.790 --> 02:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
that's sort of our little thing so she
 
02:33:29.710 --> 02:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
makes sure that I don't get to the third
 
02:33:32.510 --> 02:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
line of defense there so she um it's a
 
02:33:34.469 --> 02:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
great sort of proactive
 
02:33:37.710 --> 02:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
tool on once I found the benefit of this
 
02:33:40.190 --> 02:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
I said this is it everybody needs this
 
02:33:42.910 --> 02:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
device so I became an activist I was
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
actively involved in the CGM Medicare
 
02:33:47.870 --> 02:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
access act in 20 5 which allowed
 
02:33:52.030 --> 02:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare to cover cgms um for seniors
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
and it took about two years of lobbying
 
02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
our federal delegation but it did pass
 
02:33:58.110 --> 02:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
and um you know as one the other
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
representativ says one of the highlights
 
02:34:02.590 --> 02:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
of that testimony that I listen to was
 
02:34:04.830 --> 02:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
talking about driving they were saying
 
02:34:06.910 --> 02:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
that seniors when they're driving long
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
distances the rhythmic sort of um motion
 
02:34:12.990 --> 02:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
of a car could masquerade a low blood
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
sugar so not only does it keep them safe
 
02:34:16.150 --> 02:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
but it keeps everyone else on the road
 
02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:16.950 align:start position:0%
but it keeps everyone else on the road
Road

02:34:16.950 --> 02:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
Road
 
02:34:19.710 --> 02:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
safe so I just wanted to tell
 
02:34:22.269 --> 02:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
you how this has impacted my life how
 
02:34:24.349 --> 02:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
it's impacted everyone's else's life and
 
02:34:25.469 --> 02:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
I just hope you could keep that in
 
02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
consideration diabetes is expensive my
 
02:34:30.590 --> 02:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
husband and I both work we max out our
 
02:34:32.389 --> 02:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
fsas every year I think this year was
 
02:34:35.910 --> 02:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
2750 we could each deduct for FSA and
 
02:34:38.750 --> 02:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
that money is gone by the summer 90% of
 
02:34:41.309 --> 02:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
that goes to her it it's gone before
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
that if one of us has a test or
 
02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:46.120 align:start position:0%
something but um it's a lot and I'm
 
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
grateful that I have the opportunity to
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
be able to help her um but she worries
 
02:34:52.830 --> 02:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
about it too she's graduating in a year
 
02:34:53.870 --> 02:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
she's like I don't know how I'm going to
 
02:34:55.389 --> 02:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
afford my diabetes supplies and that
 
02:34:57.510 --> 02:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
kind of breaks my heart because I want
 
02:34:59.150 --> 02:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
her to I want her to follow her heart
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
and take a job that she wants to do not
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
a job that she has to do because of her
 
02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:05.550 align:start position:0%
a job that she has to do because of her
health

02:35:05.550 --> 02:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
health

okay you don't make it okay that way but
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%

02:35:33.469 --> 02:35:33.479 align:start position:0%
caer can you just
 
02:35:37.630 --> 02:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
press there there we go okay thank you
 
02:35:39.710 --> 02:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a registered nurse and a
 
02:35:41.790 --> 02:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
certified Diabetes Care and education

educator I have 38 years of experience
 
02:35:52.870 --> 02:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
in this field I'm also the Grassroots

leader of our local body of diabetes
 
02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
Educators and I am in support of this
 
02:36:02.670 --> 02:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
bill you've already heard a lot about
 
02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
cgms um and how they
 
02:36:09.070 --> 02:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
continuously uh measure blood sugar and
 
02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
that this data can be communicated to a
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
smartphone a smart watch and uh as our
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
previous speaker said it can also be
 
02:36:22.030 --> 02:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
communicated to the uh smartphone of a
 
02:36:24.429 --> 02:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
parent of a child with
 
02:36:26.590 --> 02:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
diabetes according to the American
 
02:36:29.670 --> 02:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
Diabetes Association 2023 executive
 
02:36:32.190 --> 02:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
summary on Health Equity in diabetes
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
technology and this is what we're
 
02:36:36.510 --> 02:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
talking about is the upcoming diabetes
 
02:36:38.950 --> 02:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
technology for all people living with
 
02:36:41.710 --> 02:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
diabetes continuous glucose monitors or
 
02:36:44.429 --> 02:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
cgms provide significant potentially
 
02:36:46.429 --> 02:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
life-changing benefits
 
02:36:49.070 --> 02:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
for diabetes management and in turn for
 
02:36:51.349 --> 02:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
avoidance or delay of serious
 
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
comorbidities hospitalizations and even
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
death well how did this system work the
 
02:37:01.190 --> 02:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
CGM communicates a blood sugar to a
 
02:37:03.510 --> 02:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
phone the person with diabetes knows
 
02:37:05.870 --> 02:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
immediately where their blood sugar is
 
02:37:08.110 --> 02:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's safe whether it's too low
 
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
too high or whether it's trending in an
 
02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:12.190 align:start position:0%
too high or whether it's trending in an
unsafe

02:37:12.190 --> 02:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
unsafe
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
Direction wearing a CGM is similar to
 
02:37:18.030 --> 02:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
having a gas gauge in a car or a blood
 
02:37:21.030 --> 02:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
sugar gauge in your body in the early
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
stages of diabetes the body does give a
 
02:37:25.469 --> 02:37:25.479 align:start position:0%
warning when the blood sugar is going
 
02:37:28.910 --> 02:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
too low many lose that warning over the
 
02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
years many lose that warning when
 
02:37:32.910 --> 02:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
they're on
 
02:37:35.429 --> 02:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
medications such as beta blockers that
 
02:37:36.830 --> 02:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
prevent them from
 
02:37:40.590 --> 02:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
experiencing the symptoms of low blood
 
02:37:42.910 --> 02:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
sugar they can't tell where the blood
 
02:37:45.790 --> 02:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
sugar is running people can become dis
 
02:37:48.630 --> 02:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
disoriented lose Consciousness have
 
02:37:52.510 --> 02:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
seizures a CGM warns a person that they
 
02:37:54.750 --> 02:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
have low blood sugar or trending in that
 
02:37:57.630 --> 02:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
direction they can then treat themselves
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
and prevent a serious health problem
 
02:38:02.830 --> 02:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen gas gauges for
 
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles have been standard since
 
02:38:09.349 --> 02:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
1920 gas gauges have long prevented
 
02:38:11.389 --> 02:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
folks from being stranded with an empty
 
02:38:14.230 --> 02:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
tank by the side of the road well isn't
 
02:38:16.110 --> 02:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
it time that persons with diabet IES
 
02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
have an accurate and continuous blood
 
02:38:20.030 --> 02:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
sugar gauge for their
 
02:38:22.750 --> 02:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
bodies by supporting this bill you can
 
02:38:24.870 --> 02:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
PR prevent a person with diabetes from
 
02:38:27.550 --> 02:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
losing Consciousness while driving a car
 
02:38:29.429 --> 02:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
and believe me I have been involved in a
 
02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
number of incidents where uh I have been
 
02:38:34.389 --> 02:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
in contact with people that were
 
02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
hospitalized because they crashed their
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle because their blood sugar went
 
02:38:41.870 --> 02:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
too low it can prevent a dangerous fall
 
02:38:44.510 --> 02:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
in people of any age group because
 
02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
there's not enough blood getting into
 
02:38:47.950 --> 02:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
the brain because there's not enough
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
blood getting to the uh the tissues we
 
02:38:53.230 --> 02:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
have seen people break hips because of
 
02:38:55.710 --> 02:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
these kinds of incidences taking
 
02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
place in both situations many many
 
02:39:02.750 --> 02:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
situations uh expensive emergency room
 
02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
visits or hospitalizations can be
 
02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
prevented let's make this life-changing
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
technology available to persons with
 
02:39:11.950 --> 02:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
diabetes in New Hampshire and I'd be
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
happy to take any of your
 
02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:16.550 align:start position:0%
happy to take any of your
questions

questions
 
02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:18.830 align:start position:0%
questions
representative

02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:39:21.790 --> 02:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
spear the kinds of incidences that
 
02:39:23.349 --> 02:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
you're talking about are you talking
 
02:39:26.910 --> 02:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
about people with type one or type two
 
02:39:29.830 --> 02:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
diabetes I am talking up PE about people
 
02:39:32.630 --> 02:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
with both kinds of diabetes okay type
 
02:39:34.830 --> 02:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
one are individuals that use insulin
 
02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
this has also happened to type two
 
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
diabetes using uh individuals using
 
02:39:41.269 --> 02:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
insulin it has also happened to
 
02:39:42.710 --> 02:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
individuals who are on a group of
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
medications called uh sulon uas
 
02:39:48.349 --> 02:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh these are an older School of drugs
 
02:39:50.910 --> 02:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
that are available but they uh actually
 
02:39:53.790 --> 02:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
stimulate the pancreas to make more
 
02:39:58.910 --> 02:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
insulin but it it it's it's like a um it
 
02:40:01.150 --> 02:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
makes insulin constantly you can't turn
 
02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
it off so individuals that are on these
 
02:40:07.070 --> 02:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
oral meds for diabetes the sulon uas in
 
02:40:09.630 --> 02:40:09.640 align:start position:0%
particular okay can have a problem with
 
02:40:11.469 --> 02:40:11.479 align:start position:0%
their blood Su going low and they can
 
02:40:14.429 --> 02:40:14.439 align:start position:0%
also have the same uh complications as
 
02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
people with type 1 diabet IES and that
 
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
they lose their warning signs for low
 
02:40:20.590 --> 02:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
blood sugar they can't tell where it is
 
02:40:23.790 --> 02:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
at as they're driving uh they can't tell
 
02:40:27.230 --> 02:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
where it is at when they're sleeping um
 
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
many many people have experienced low
 
02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
blood sugar while they're asleep uh and
 
02:40:36.510 --> 02:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:39.389 --> 02:40:39.399 align:start position:0%
consequences thank you very
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%

and I hope it won't be whole eight
 
02:40:50.230 --> 02:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
minutes I hope you can they're already
 
02:40:52.150 --> 02:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
covered a lot so great that's very fun
 
02:40:53.990 --> 02:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
some appreciate it thank you thank you
 
02:40:55.990 --> 02:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
for your time my name is Emily Dupont
 
02:40:57.590 --> 02:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a registered nurse a certified
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
Diabetes Care and education specialist
 
02:41:00.790 --> 02:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
but more importantly why I'm here today
 
02:41:02.150 --> 02:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
is to tell you I'm the wife of a person
 
02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
with type 1
 
02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
diabetes the American Diabetes
 
02:41:07.469 --> 02:41:07.479 align:start position:0%
Association releases the standards of
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
care and diabetes annually which we've
 
02:41:10.670 --> 02:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
talked about within those standards are
 
02:41:12.510 --> 02:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice recommendations
 
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
and support for the optimal management
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
of diabetes when one of those
 
02:41:17.429 --> 02:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice standards is the
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
use of glucose monitoring for diabetes
 
02:41:20.750 --> 02:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
management both the finger stick
 
02:41:22.110 --> 02:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring and continuous glucose
 
02:41:23.710 --> 02:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring in these standards are
 
02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
recommended to be incorporated into
 
02:41:27.790 --> 02:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
individualized treatment plans for those
 
02:41:29.750 --> 02:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
with type 1 type two gestational
 
02:41:31.230 --> 02:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
diabetes and
 
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemia the Ada also recommends
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
that patients with diabetes maintain an
 
02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
average glucose of less than 154 which
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
translates to a hemoglobin A1c
 
02:41:43.790 --> 02:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
percentage of 7% for optimal
 
02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
management continuous gluc glucose
 
02:41:48.190 --> 02:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
monitoring devices which I'll call cgms
 
02:41:49.870 --> 02:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
do the same as do what the name implies
 
02:41:51.429 --> 02:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
they continuously check your sugar and
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
deliver a value to a handheld device a
 
02:41:56.429 --> 02:41:56.439 align:start position:0%
cell phone or an insulin pump the price
 
02:41:58.870 --> 02:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
of these cgms can run between $160 to
 
02:42:01.550 --> 02:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
$500 a month depending on the CGM and
 
02:42:03.510 --> 02:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage or high deductible or
 
02:42:06.429 --> 02:42:06.439 align:start position:0%
lack thereof when CGM use is implemented
 
02:42:08.349 --> 02:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
it makes significant positive changes in
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
the user's quality of life because it
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
helps to drive Behavior change I
 
02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
personally have a patient who came to me
 
02:42:17.269 --> 02:42:17.279 align:start position:0%
for the first time with an A1c of 11.9%
 
02:42:19.950 --> 02:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
a weight of 403 lb and an inability to
 
02:42:22.830 --> 02:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
walk long distances this individual is
 
02:42:24.990 --> 02:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
retired and living on a fixed income
 
02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
they discussed having received diabetes
 
02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
education before but felt incredibly
 
02:42:30.190 --> 02:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
discouraged with their management up to
 
02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
this point we discussed CGM use and they
 
02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
agreed to try it there was no medication
 
02:42:36.429 --> 02:42:36.439 align:start position:0%
changes occurring at this time because
 
02:42:37.870 --> 02:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
he was not agreeable to that plan of
 
02:42:40.830 --> 02:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
care by introducing CGM and the patient
 
02:42:43.150 --> 02:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
making lifestyle modifications based on
 
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
the results that he received from the
 
02:42:49.469 --> 02:42:49.479 align:start position:0%
CGM his A1C reduced from 11.9% to 7.6%
 
02:42:51.670 --> 02:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
in three months then another reduction
 
02:42:54.670 --> 02:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
to 6.5% in 4 months with a total weight
 
02:42:57.550 --> 02:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
loss of 65 pounds so far their once
 
02:42:59.910 --> 02:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
average glucose at any given time was
 
02:43:02.550 --> 02:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
386 exposing them to a very real and
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
very expensive risk factors of unmanaged
 
02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
diabetes this risk has been
 
02:43:08.269 --> 02:43:08.279 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced as his average
 
02:43:11.150 --> 02:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
glucose is now 127 with no significant
 
02:43:13.309 --> 02:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemic events meaning they're able
 
02:43:14.710 --> 02:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
to manage their diabetes and their
 
02:43:17.150 --> 02:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
glucose safely this aligns with the
 
02:43:18.990 --> 02:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
Ada's recommendations of maintaining an
 
02:43:21.670 --> 02:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
A1C of less than 7% or an average
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
glucose of less than 154 this same
 
02:43:25.990 --> 02:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
patient is currently facing non-
 
02:43:28.150 --> 02:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
coverage for CGM supplies and is asking
 
02:43:29.389 --> 02:43:29.399 align:start position:0%
the same questions that many of my
 
02:43:31.150 --> 02:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
patients ask how am I going to afford
 
02:43:32.830 --> 02:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
this if insurance doesn't cover it I
 
02:43:34.950 --> 02:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
can't lose this tool I've been I haven't
 
02:43:36.990 --> 02:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
felt this healthy or been this confident
 
02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
in my diabetes management ever this
 
02:43:40.670 --> 02:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
device has provided me with the
 
02:43:42.389 --> 02:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
confidence and security to take back
 
02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
control of my diabetes it saved my life
 
02:43:45.870 --> 02:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
in my future
 
02:43:47.870 --> 02:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
cgms not only help to drive Behavior
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
change but they provide Safety and
 
02:43:51.469 --> 02:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
Security for those who do not experience
 
02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
symptoms of glucose fluctuations for
 
02:43:55.150 --> 02:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
patients who do not feel symptoms of
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
life-threatening hypoglycemia which is
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
increasingly common in the elderly
 
02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
patient population the CGM alerts the
 
02:44:03.349 --> 02:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
wear as we've already been told and
 
02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
allows them to make an intervention
 
02:44:08.030 --> 02:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
before emergency medical attention is
 
02:44:09.990 --> 02:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
necessary Switching gears from my
 
02:44:11.710 --> 02:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
professional experience for a moment and
 
02:44:13.309 --> 02:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
to look at the through the vantage point
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
of a wife of someone with typee 1
 
02:44:16.910 --> 02:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
diabetes it was heartbreaking for me to
 
02:44:18.630 --> 02:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
hear my husband tell me when we were
 
02:44:21.230 --> 02:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
teenagers that he has to always have a
 
02:44:23.030 --> 02:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
good paying job with good insurance
 
02:44:25.070 --> 02:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
benefits because he has Type 1 diabetes
 
02:44:26.349 --> 02:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be expensive for him
 
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
to live a healthy life as a teenager his
 
02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
parents discussed with him the cost of
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
his diabetes supplies insulin his
 
02:44:35.349 --> 02:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
insulin pump his pump supplies his
 
02:44:37.349 --> 02:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
glucose testing supplies emergency
 
02:44:39.510 --> 02:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
medications for diabetes which tallied
 
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
up to requiring to tuck away over $5,000
 
02:44:44.429 --> 02:44:44.439 align:start position:0%
a year for his diabetes supplies and
 
02:44:47.070 --> 02:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
this is with having insurance he has had
 
02:44:49.469 --> 02:44:49.479 align:start position:0%
diabetes since he was 3 years old having
 
02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
to instill in children that they have no
 
02:44:53.710 --> 02:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
other option but to obtain a good paying
 
02:44:55.550 --> 02:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
job with excellent Insurance packages
 
02:44:57.230 --> 02:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
when they grow up because they developed
 
02:44:58.630 --> 02:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
a health care condition that wasn't
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
their fault and has no cure for but is
 
02:45:02.469 --> 02:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
going to be very financially expensive
 
02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
for them to pay for if they want to have
 
02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
equal access to the same Health outcomes
 
02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
as those without diabetes to teach
 
02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
children that they will have two and a
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
half times higher health care costs to
 
02:45:14.550 --> 02:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
access the very necessary equipment and
 
02:45:16.830 --> 02:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
medications they require to live just to
 
02:45:19.150 --> 02:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
live as recommended by the Ada standards
 
02:45:21.550 --> 02:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
of care we need to be asking ourselves
 
02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
is that what we want to teach our
 
02:45:25.150 --> 02:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
children with diabetes I've had very
 
02:45:26.550 --> 02:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
young adult patients tell me that they
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
can't afford their testing supplies on
 
02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
their slightly above minimum wage job
 
02:45:31.710 --> 02:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
with benefits packages offered at work
 
02:45:32.469 --> 02:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
and that they feel they're
 
02:45:33.710 --> 02:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
disappointment to themselves and their
 
02:45:35.309 --> 02:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
doctors and that they're worried about
 
02:45:36.750 --> 02:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
their health and their future because
 
02:45:38.790 --> 02:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
they can't afford their supplies on the
 
02:45:40.510 --> 02:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
other end of the age Spectrum I've had
 
02:45:42.150 --> 02:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
many many elderly patients tell me that
 
02:45:43.550 --> 02:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
they had to pick and choose between what
 
02:45:45.309 --> 02:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
they can afford for their medications
 
02:45:46.950 --> 02:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
paying their bills and buying their
 
02:45:49.150 --> 02:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
diabetes supplies they have to have food
 
02:45:50.590 --> 02:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
in a roof over their head and they have
 
02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
to pay their bills they have to have
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
their expensive medications and their
 
02:45:55.790 --> 02:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
co-pays but what they're also paying is
 
02:45:57.309 --> 02:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
that they're and they're not paying it
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
for in money but is the quality of
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
health and overall life every time these
 
02:46:03.469 --> 02:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
individuals are forced to pick and
 
02:46:04.870 --> 02:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
choose what they can afford for their
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
health care this month they're paying
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
with in a reduction of quality of life
 
02:46:10.670 --> 02:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
going forward forgoing months of testing
 
02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
and forgoing the ability to make
 
02:46:13.870 --> 02:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
informed Health decisions based off of
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
their glucose values means increasing
 
02:46:17.790 --> 02:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
their risk for complications directly
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
related to unmanaged diabetes it means
 
02:46:22.309 --> 02:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular complications and kidney
 
02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
complications means possible amputations
 
02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
which you've heard of it means blindness
 
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
more procedures more appointments and it
 
02:46:30.750 --> 02:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
means death because diabetes is the
 
02:46:31.870 --> 02:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
eighth leading cause of death in the
 
02:46:34.230 --> 02:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
United States thank
 
02:46:37.630 --> 02:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
02:46:39.550 --> 02:46:39.560 align:start position:0%
much uh
 
02:46:42.990 --> 02:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
Gan Brown you have a question over there
 
02:46:46.429 --> 02:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
oh represent of kids
 
02:46:50.349 --> 02:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um as a nurse uh who
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
specializes in Diabetes Care can you
 
02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
give us an idea I realize it won't be
 
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
exact can you give give us an idea of
 
02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
how common it is for serious
 
02:47:03.750 --> 02:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
complications such as uh amputations to
 
02:47:06.990 --> 02:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
occur in diabetes patients who do not
 
02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:08.630 align:start position:0%
occur in diabetes patients who do not
require

02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
require
 
02:47:10.990 --> 02:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
insulin it's in it's incredibly common
 
02:47:12.269 --> 02:47:12.279 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of patients that don't
 
02:47:14.550 --> 02:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
require insulin or don't have access but
 
02:47:16.269 --> 02:47:16.279 align:start position:0%
that don't require insulin that are
 
02:47:18.429 --> 02:47:18.439 align:start position:0%
managed on oral medications that still
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
have extremely high a1c's which the the
 
02:47:23.190 --> 02:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
studies show relate to amputations
 
02:47:24.870 --> 02:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
blindness and things of that nature so
 
02:47:28.429 --> 02:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:32.469 --> 02:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
high okay thanks
 
02:47:38.110 --> 02:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:41.429 --> 02:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
go hi I'm Jean Brown and I've been a
 
02:47:43.790 --> 02:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
resident of gtown New Hampshire for 39
 
02:47:46.309 --> 02:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
years um I've also worked in several
 
02:47:49.469 --> 02:47:49.479 align:start position:0%
different um hospitals I'm a certified
 
02:47:51.870 --> 02:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
Diabetes Care and educational specialist
 
02:47:53.950 --> 02:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for letting me speak
 
02:47:56.590 --> 02:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
today um and I'm just going to say um
 
02:47:59.950 --> 02:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
ditto to what um Emily and Liz already
 
02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
said so I don't keep you here too long
 
02:48:07.150 --> 02:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
um but um I did want to share um a
 
02:48:09.590 --> 02:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
couple of uh stories just to um very
 
02:48:11.349 --> 02:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
briefly about a couple of patients that
 
02:48:15.269 --> 02:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
I've had um and I just also wanted to
 
02:48:18.910 --> 02:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
just quickly show you just what you're
 
02:48:24.469 --> 02:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
deciding on so this is um um a meter
 
02:48:27.710 --> 02:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
that checks blood sugar but this meter
 
02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
requires that you prick yourself with
 
02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
this okay so if you're doing if you have
 
02:48:37.349 --> 02:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
to check your blood
 
02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
sugar um four times a day that means you
 
02:48:42.670 --> 02:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
have to stab your finger four times a
 
02:48:44.469 --> 02:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
day okay and then you have to put in a
 
02:48:47.190 --> 02:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
test strip you have to clean your hands
 
02:48:49.389 --> 02:48:49.399 align:start position:0%
either wash them or use alcohol and put
 
02:48:51.309 --> 02:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
the test strip in here you have to
 
02:48:53.190 --> 02:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
change the Lan set you have to have a
 
02:48:56.550 --> 02:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
place to dispose of your L sets um this
 
02:48:59.590 --> 02:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
is time consuming and it gives you a
 
02:49:03.630 --> 02:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
snapshot in time okay if you're wearing
 
02:49:07.830 --> 02:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
um a CGM so if you're wearing that on
 
02:49:09.870 --> 02:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
the back of your arm or you're wearing
 
02:49:13.030 --> 02:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
one on your abdomen um you can just look
 
02:49:15.750 --> 02:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
at your phone
 
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
and see what your blood sugar is so I
 
02:49:20.750 --> 02:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted you to
 
02:49:25.590 --> 02:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
see okay so this is obviously very
 
02:49:29.750 --> 02:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
convenient okay so um one patient um I
 
02:49:32.030 --> 02:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
had is man with type 1 diabetes who
 
02:49:34.870 --> 02:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
worked in the service industry I mean I
 
02:49:36.950 --> 02:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
can't be too specific because I can't
 
02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:37.910 align:start position:0%
can't be too specific because I can't
give

02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
give
 
02:49:40.309 --> 02:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
identifiers um he didn't have very good
 
02:49:42.469 --> 02:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
insurance he had insurance but he had a
 
02:49:45.790 --> 02:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
$5,000 deductible um so he had to pay
 
02:49:47.790 --> 02:49:47.800 align:start position:0%
out of pocket for most of his
 
02:49:51.070 --> 02:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
supplies um and he I'll will say that
 
02:49:52.670 --> 02:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
he's a patient that used to run out of
 
02:49:55.309 --> 02:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
insulin until you guys pass the bill for
 
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
insulin affordability so thank you so
 
02:50:00.750 --> 02:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
much um he was supposed to check his
 
02:50:02.950 --> 02:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
blood sugar four times a day and part of
 
02:50:05.830 --> 02:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
that is because your amount of insulin
 
02:50:07.469 --> 02:50:07.479 align:start position:0%
that you need to take is often
 
02:50:09.150 --> 02:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
determined by what your blood sugar
 
02:50:11.469 --> 02:50:11.479 align:start position:0%
reading is if you don't know what your
 
02:50:13.309 --> 02:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
blood sugar is you don't know how much
 
02:50:16.910 --> 02:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
insulin to take um unfortunately he
 
02:50:19.070 --> 02:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't um check his blood sugar very
 
02:50:21.349 --> 02:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
much he couldn't afford to do it um his
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
diabetes control um was very poor he had
 
02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
neuropathy already that's numbness and
 
02:50:28.990 --> 02:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
tingling in the fingers and toes he had
 
02:50:30.269 --> 02:50:30.279 align:start position:0%
some vision
 
02:50:33.550 --> 02:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
problems um he also had many nights
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
where he had um extremely low blood
 
02:50:38.910 --> 02:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
sugars and EMTs had to come to the house
 
02:50:41.309 --> 02:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
um and he also had
 
02:50:43.510 --> 02:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations I was able to get this
 
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
patient a example um CGM for him to
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
trial for two weeks um and he did
 
02:50:53.870 --> 02:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
amazingly well he had no low blood
 
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
sugars in the middle of the night his um
 
02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
blood sugars were much more in control
 
02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
um and then we were able to get him
 
02:51:04.190 --> 02:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
another sample so for a whole month of
 
02:51:07.229 --> 02:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
his life he had the best blood sugars he
 
02:51:09.510 --> 02:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
ever had unfortunately it was a
 
02:51:12.110 --> 02:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
temporary fix he could not afford it if
 
02:51:15.389 --> 02:51:15.399 align:start position:0%
he had the only $30 a month um to pay
 
02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
for a CGM like the bill is proposing um
 
02:51:20.349 --> 02:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
that would definitely be a life-changing
 
02:51:21.670 --> 02:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
event for this
 
02:51:24.870 --> 02:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
person um the other patient was um a
 
02:51:27.389 --> 02:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
pregnant woman woman with gestational
 
02:51:29.910 --> 02:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
diabetes that's kind of like a temporary
 
02:51:33.030 --> 02:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
diabetes um she had terrible needle
 
02:51:35.429 --> 02:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
phobia and when I told her that one of
 
02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
the things we have women with
 
02:51:38.710 --> 02:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
gestational diabetes they need to test
 
02:51:42.110 --> 02:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
four times a day um and she just started
 
02:51:44.510 --> 02:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
to cry and shake and she just had Terri
 
02:51:46.309 --> 02:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
terrible needle phobia and she said that
 
02:51:48.070 --> 02:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
she there was no way that she was going
 
02:51:52.630 --> 02:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to to do this um so I knew
 
02:51:54.790 --> 02:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
that a continuous glucose monitor would
 
02:51:57.309 --> 02:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
be the best thing for her um I gave her
 
02:52:01.229 --> 02:52:01.239 align:start position:0%
again I put a sample um one on her and
 
02:52:02.950 --> 02:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
um so we had an idea of how our blood
 
02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
sugars were doing unfortunately I could
 
02:52:09.469 --> 02:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
not get the insurance to cover it they
 
02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
would not accept um the needle phobia as
 
02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
a reason for this woman eing a
 
02:52:15.990 --> 02:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
continuous gluc ose monitor so
 
02:52:17.469 --> 02:52:17.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for the rest of her
 
02:52:19.510 --> 02:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy she did not check her blood
 
02:52:21.590 --> 02:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
sugars and she ended up going into
 
02:52:25.710 --> 02:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
premature labor and had a preey baby so
 
02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
um if we can get coverage for um and you
 
02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of risk for um women
 
02:52:33.990 --> 02:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
um they can have premature babies excess
 
02:52:36.670 --> 02:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
amniotic fluid um and they can also
 
02:52:38.309 --> 02:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
cause um still
 
02:52:41.510 --> 02:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
birth so um thank you very much for

lden I'm been living with type two
 
02:53:35.469 --> 02:53:35.479 align:start position:0%
diabetes for over 30 years I'm 85 years
 
02:53:38.910 --> 02:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
old and because
 
02:53:38.920 --> 02:53:41.190 align:start position:0%
old and because
of

02:53:41.190 --> 02:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
insulin and blood glucose monitoring
 
02:53:46.550 --> 02:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
I've been a able to live quite well with
 
02:53:49.710 --> 02:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
it and avoid some of the really awful
 
02:53:52.429 --> 02:53:52.439 align:start position:0%
complications that are all too common
 
02:53:52.439 --> 02:53:54.030 align:start position:0%
complications that are all too common
with

02:53:54.030 --> 02:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:53:56.590 --> 02:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
diabetes by passing this
 
02:53:59.429 --> 02:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
bill you're going to save
 
02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
lives that's not a
 
02:54:04.309 --> 02:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
hyperbole that's a
 
02:54:08.469 --> 02:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
fact you've already heard it many times
 
02:54:10.349 --> 02:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
I've experienced
 
02:54:14.670 --> 02:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
it during sleep my blood sugar has
 
02:54:14.680 --> 02:54:15.910 align:start position:0%
it during sleep my blood sugar has
dropped

02:54:15.910 --> 02:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
dropped
 
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
low thank God for the continuous glucose
 
02:54:25.550 --> 02:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
monitoring I got an alarm wakes me up I
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
immediately go to my regular little
 
02:54:31.910 --> 02:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
blood glucose meter to confirm in fact
 
02:54:33.190 --> 02:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:54:36.150 --> 02:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
Hypoglycemia so I treated them by taking
 
02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
glucose tablets usually about 15 Gams 15
 
02:54:43.150 --> 02:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
minutes later I test again so I've been
 
02:54:46.269 --> 02:54:46.279 align:start position:0%
able to avoid
 
02:54:47.830 --> 02:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
becom an
 
02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
unconscious and experience what they
 
02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:55.550 align:start position:0%
unconscious and experience what they
call

02:54:55.550 --> 02:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:55.560 --> 02:54:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
dead

02:54:57.990 --> 02:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
dead
 
02:55:01.229 --> 02:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
so I know it
 
02:55:04.790 --> 02:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
firsthand you can help people like
 
02:55:08.269 --> 02:55:08.279 align:start position:0%
me by passing this
 
02:55:11.750 --> 02:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill poorly controlled
 
02:55:14.590 --> 02:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
diabetes has devastating comp
 
02:55:17.630 --> 02:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
applications you heard many of them
 
02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
blindness you've heard about the
 
02:55:21.349 --> 02:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
comparison of
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
costs well let's just take one of the
 
02:55:26.070 --> 02:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
complications that's common in diabetes
 
02:55:28.469 --> 02:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
loss of kidney
 
02:55:31.590 --> 02:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
function that means you go into dialysis
 
02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
into the hospital three times a
 
02:55:37.070 --> 02:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
week that's 500 bucks a
 
02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:43.990 --> 02:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
$72,000 not to mention the loss of
 
02:55:45.830 --> 02:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
quality quality of
 
02:55:49.349 --> 02:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
life that's what's on the
 
02:55:52.469 --> 02:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
table so we have within our power within
 
02:55:52.479 --> 02:55:53.349 align:start position:0%
table so we have within our power within
your

02:55:53.349 --> 02:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:55:56.710 --> 02:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
beings to give people like myself the
 
02:55:59.630 --> 02:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
tools to manage our diabetes and they
 
02:56:02.510 --> 02:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't call it diabetes self management
 
02:56:05.349 --> 02:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
for nothing we're the ones that got to
 
02:56:08.349 --> 02:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
manage this thing but we got to have the
 
02:56:11.510 --> 02:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
tools to do it and those tools are
 
02:56:15.950 --> 02:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
available and uh so I want thank you for
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
supporting House Bill
 
02:56:21.510 --> 02:56:21.520 align:start position:0%

committee uh I'm representative
 
04:14:34.189 --> 04:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
Katherine Romo I have the pleasure of
 
04:14:36.269 --> 04:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro County District 2
 
04:14:37.750 --> 04:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
town of Bedford
 
04:14:40.510 --> 04:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce HB 1296 which
 
04:14:42.389 --> 04:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
relates to insurance coverage for
 
04:14:44.429 --> 04:14:44.439 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic and supplemental breast
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
examinations uh in short this bill is uh
 
04:14:48.910 --> 04:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
to increase earlier detection of breast
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
cancer by eliminating supplemental
 
04:14:52.269 --> 04:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
Imaging and examination costs to
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
patients that deter them from seeking
 
04:14:56.030 --> 04:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up and diagnostic
 
04:14:58.149 --> 04:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
care uh as you may already be aware
 
04:15:00.030 --> 04:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
getting a mamogram is only the initial
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
step and is not alone able to diagnose
 
04:15:05.229 --> 04:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
cancer early detection of breast cancer
 
04:15:07.109 --> 04:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
is not possible without the medically
 
04:15:09.670 --> 04:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
necessary diagnostic follow-up or
 
04:15:11.870 --> 04:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
additional supplemental Imaging required
 
04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
to rule out breast cancer or to confirm
 
04:15:16.309 --> 04:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
the need for a biopsy uh while
 
04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
mammograms are widely covered by
 
04:15:20.030 --> 04:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
insurance without patient cost sharing
 
04:15:22.070 --> 04:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh some individuals at higher risk of
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
breast cancer or those requiring
 
04:15:25.630 --> 04:15:25.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up Imaging due to an abnormal
 
04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
mamogram results uh face hundreds to
 
04:15:30.349 --> 04:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars in further cost
 
04:15:32.109 --> 04:15:32.119 align:start position:0%
before even potentially being diagnosed
 
04:15:34.590 --> 04:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
with breast cancer I personally wanted
 
04:15:36.269 --> 04:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
to sponsor this bill because my mom was
 
04:15:38.790 --> 04:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
one of the estimated 12 to 16% of women
 
04:15:40.990 --> 04:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
screened for uh mammogram required
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up Diagnostic Imaging resulting
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
in a breast cancer diagnosis that we're
 
04:15:47.309 --> 04:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
very lucky she was able to treat over
 
04:15:49.870 --> 04:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
many months um while she was able to
 
04:15:51.750 --> 04:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
afford her Diagnostic Imaging that not
 
04:15:53.349 --> 04:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
everyone is as
 
04:15:55.710 --> 04:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
fortunate I know others in this room
 
04:15:58.510 --> 04:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
have also supported wives and sisters
 
04:16:00.189 --> 04:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
daughters and mothers through this
 
04:16:01.750 --> 04:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
difficult journey and some have lived
 
04:16:04.149 --> 04:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
through breast cancer themselves it is
 
04:16:05.790 --> 04:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
my hope that with this legislation more
 
04:16:07.510 --> 04:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
women will not let Financial barriers
 
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
delay an early diagnosis of breast
 
04:16:11.550 --> 04:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
cancer and further delay treatment
 
04:16:14.309 --> 04:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
options by detecting breast cancer early
 
04:16:16.469 --> 04:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
these exams can save lives and reduce
 
04:16:18.790 --> 04:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
the need for more invasive and expensive
 
04:16:20.910 --> 04:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
treatments I have a few statistics I'd
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
like to share with you it is estimated
 
04:16:25.590 --> 04:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
that 40% of women in the US have dense
 
04:16:27.550 --> 04:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
breast tissue and this dense tissue
 
04:16:29.309 --> 04:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
makes it more difficult to detect breast
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
cancer through a
 
04:16:32.950 --> 04:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
mamogram average out-of-pocket costs for
 
04:16:35.070 --> 04:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic Imaging examinations range
 
04:16:35.080 --> 04:16:35.870 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic Imaging examinations range
from

04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:16:38.309 --> 04:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
$234 to
 
04:16:41.750 --> 04:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
$1,021 in 2023 alone more than
 
04:16:44.070 --> 04:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
1,390 individuals were diagnosed with
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
breast cancer and more than 180 died in
 
04:16:48.670 --> 04:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from breast
 
04:16:51.109 --> 04:16:51.119 align:start position:0%
cancer research suggests that when women
 
04:16:52.990 --> 04:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
with dense breast tissue do not receive
 
04:16:55.389 --> 04:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
supplemental breast exams up to onethird
 
04:16:58.510 --> 04:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
of breast cancer diagnoses can be missed
 
04:17:00.109 --> 04:17:00.119 align:start position:0%
the longer it takes for women to detect
 
04:17:02.070 --> 04:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
breast cancer the quicker their 5-year
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
survival rates
 
04:17:06.389 --> 04:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
decline according to a recent Maryland
 
04:17:08.469 --> 04:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
study the estimated cost impact of
 
04:17:10.389 --> 04:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
eliminating cost sharing requirements
 
04:17:13.070 --> 04:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
for Diagnostic Imaging examinations uh
 
04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
for Diagnostic evaluation of the breast
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
put at 7 cents per member per month or
 
04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
about 83 cents per year uh according to
 
04:17:23.109 --> 04:17:23.119 align:start position:0%
a recent Massachusetts study requiring
 
04:17:25.229 --> 04:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
coverage for Diagnostic examinations
 
04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
would result in an estimated average
 
04:17:29.309 --> 04:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
increase to the typical member's monthly
 
04:17:31.109 --> 04:17:31.119 align:start position:0%
health insurance premium between 19
 
04:17:34.389 --> 04:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
cents and 33 cents per member per month
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid provides these diagnostic exams
 
04:17:38.950 --> 04:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
and no cost to patients and similar
 
04:17:40.710 --> 04:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
legislation has been enacted in 20
 
04:17:42.229 --> 04:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
States across the country already
 
04:17:43.590 --> 04:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
including Maine and Connecticut it's
 
04:17:45.550 --> 04:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
pending in Vermont Massachusetts but
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
also Texas Tennessee uh Missouri um all
 
04:17:51.550 --> 04:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
over the country it's it's really
 
04:17:54.670 --> 04:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
widespread uh this legislation has been
 
04:17:56.990 --> 04:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
successful um imposing cost sharing on
 
04:17:59.670 --> 04:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
these exams can discourage individuals
 
04:18:01.950 --> 04:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
from seeking necessary care leading to
 
04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
delays and diagnosis and treatment that
 
04:18:05.429 --> 04:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
can have serious
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
consequences by eliminating cost sharing
 
04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
health insurance policies we can provide
 
04:18:11.469 --> 04:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
individuals with the care they need to
 
04:18:13.109 --> 04:18:13.119 align:start position:0%
stay healthy and prevent much more
 
04:18:14.550 --> 04:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
serious health issues from arising in
 
04:18:16.670 --> 04:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
the future it is important to ensure
 
04:18:17.910 --> 04:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
that all women regardless of their
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
breast density or other risk factors
 
04:18:21.469 --> 04:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
have access to comprehensive breast
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
cancer screening exams when appropriate
 
04:18:25.229 --> 04:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
so that breast cancer is detected
 
04:18:27.630 --> 04:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
earlier when it is most treatable I know
 
04:18:28.870 --> 04:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
you're considering many bills I
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate your attention today I ask
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote a to pass on hb1
 
04:18:36.070 --> 04:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
1296 um thank you for your time I'm
 
04:18:37.790 --> 04:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions as best I
 
04:18:40.269 --> 04:18:40.279 align:start position:0%
can as well as to uh defer to some
 
04:18:40.279 --> 04:18:42.750 align:start position:0%
can as well as to uh defer to some
upcoming

04:18:42.750 --> 04:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
upcoming
 
04:18:44.830 --> 04:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
testimony representative
 
04:18:47.950 --> 04:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
s thanks um so you said that this has
 
04:18:49.229 --> 04:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
been passed or a version of this has
 
04:18:50.670 --> 04:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
been passed in a few other states you
 
04:18:52.750 --> 04:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
named some of them has there been so it
 
04:18:52.760 --> 04:18:53.590 align:start position:0%
named some of them has there been so it
sounds

04:18:53.590 --> 04:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
sounds
 
04:18:56.590 --> 04:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
like the bill says it's going to require
 
04:18:59.070 --> 04:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh no cost sharing for anything that for
 
04:19:01.030 --> 04:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
any insurance plan that has coverage
 
04:19:02.309 --> 04:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
currently right so right now there's
 
04:19:05.389 --> 04:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
cost sharing are there any plans that
 
04:19:07.990 --> 04:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
don't have coverage for these sorts of
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
procedures or is that essentially every
 
04:19:12.670 --> 04:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
plan that we have so mammograms and
 
04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
again testimony after me can correct me
 
04:19:15.309 --> 04:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong my understands mammograms
 
04:19:17.990 --> 04:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
are generally covered but without cost
 
04:19:20.590 --> 04:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
to the patient um but that once if you
 
04:19:22.990 --> 04:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
need followup or additional Imaging or
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
for diagnosis that is not entirely
 
04:19:27.469 --> 04:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
covered there is patient cost for that
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
followup testing or Imaging okay all
 
04:19:31.710 --> 04:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
right cool
 
04:19:34.670 --> 04:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
thanks okay
 
04:19:38.630 --> 04:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
um I feel like this is Deja Vu I mean I
 
04:19:38.640 --> 04:19:39.670 align:start position:0%
um I feel like this is Deja Vu I mean I
I

04:19:39.670 --> 04:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:19:42.510 --> 04:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
heard we did
 
04:19:45.429 --> 04:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh I remember was we the big debate was
 
04:19:51.429 --> 04:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
3D 3D mammograms or 3D years and and the
 
04:19:53.189 --> 04:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
har it was the Harvard medical director
 
04:19:56.229 --> 04:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
who who didn't like it is that what this
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill is about or I mean why why do we
 
04:20:01.750 --> 04:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
what we already have right now we're in
 
04:20:04.070 --> 04:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
compliance with Affordable Care Act that
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
any me uh uh this should already be
 
04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
mandated I mean what what insurance
 
04:20:12.030 --> 04:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
company's not covering this now I guess
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
I should ask why do this they're they're
 
04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
not covering all patients are still
 
04:20:19.229 --> 04:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
incurring costs from the $234 to $1,000
 
04:20:20.550 --> 04:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
for some of this followup it's not just
 
04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
about the 3D imaging necessarily though
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
it it's about diagnostic screening I
 
04:20:26.750 --> 04:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
have others who can testify uh in
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
further detail but I don't think it's it
 
04:20:31.790 --> 04:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
is the same as what you previously heard
 
04:20:33.630 --> 04:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
not this not the breast examination this
 
04:20:36.670 --> 04:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
is something different it's for followup
 
04:20:38.990 --> 04:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
Imaging uh what does that mean meaning
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
if there if there something that in the
 
04:20:42.790 --> 04:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
additional mamogram that looks
 
04:20:44.349 --> 04:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
problematic that you need further
 
04:20:45.910 --> 04:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
Imaging or further Imaging to actually
 
04:20:47.469 --> 04:20:47.479 align:start position:0%
reach a diagnosis or to determine if you
 
04:20:50.710 --> 04:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
needed a biopsy for further testing uh
 
04:20:52.510 --> 04:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
you need further Imaging especially for
 
04:20:54.389 --> 04:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
dense breast tissue that won't show up
 
04:20:56.389 --> 04:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily in a typical mamogram you're
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
saying the insurance companies are not
 
04:20:59.070 --> 04:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
covering this I'm saying that they're
 
04:21:00.309 --> 04:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
not covering all the cost patients are
 
04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
still paying out of pocket cost for that
 
04:21:05.990 --> 04:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
followup Imaging so I can only imagine
 
04:21:08.510 --> 04:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the only people who are if the
 
04:21:10.229 --> 04:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
insurance company is not is rejecting it
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
or not doing it it's got to be ais's
 
04:21:15.309 --> 04:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
it's got to be because under the
 
04:21:18.070 --> 04:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act it's required so my
 
04:21:18.630 --> 04:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
understanding is that under the
 
04:21:20.309 --> 04:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act mammograms are
 
04:21:24.309 --> 04:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
covered entirely um but I I well I will
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
have testimony following with can answer
 
04:21:27.870 --> 04:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
that question further right well I can
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
just say that I I don't see any
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
opposition from anybody so I can only
 
04:21:34.630 --> 04:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
imagine that the people who really who
 
04:21:36.630 --> 04:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
are okay but we'll I'll listen to other
 
04:21:38.269 --> 04:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
people all right thank you very much
 
04:21:40.990 --> 04:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
anybody other questions see none thank
 
04:21:53.550 --> 04:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:57.670 --> 04:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
Cuts okay now I got some
 
04:22:02.550 --> 04:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:07.750 --> 04:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
right yes press the press the go okay
 
04:22:10.030 --> 04:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman um Vice chairman

and members of the Commerce and
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
consumers affair committee thank you for
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to provide testimony and
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
support of HB 1296 which which relates
 
04:22:18.990 --> 04:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
to coverage of medically necessary
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
breast Imaging my name is Angelica Kats
 
04:22:23.229 --> 04:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm the regional manager of State
 
04:22:25.750 --> 04:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
policy and advocacy at Susan G colan
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
keman is the world's leading nonprofit
 
04:22:29.389 --> 04:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
breast cancer organization representing
 
04:22:30.870 --> 04:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
the millions of people who have been
 
04:22:33.469 --> 04:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with breast cancer um to
 
04:22:36.590 --> 04:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
answer your question from earlier uh we
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
know that mamography is available to
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
millions of women as the result of the
 
04:22:45.389 --> 04:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act um 16% however 16%
 
04:22:48.070 --> 04:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
of individuals will require follow-up
 
04:22:50.510 --> 04:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
Imaging due to an abnormal mamogram
 
04:22:53.349 --> 04:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
result and they will face uh hundreds to
 
04:22:54.990 --> 04:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars in patient call
 
04:22:57.469 --> 04:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
sharing for this required Imaging so
 
04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
that follow-up test is not covered um so
 
04:23:02.510 --> 04:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
we know the mamography is only the
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
initial step in the early detection
 
04:23:07.710 --> 04:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
process um and it's not um you know and
 
04:23:10.830 --> 04:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
is not able to diagnose the cancer alone
 
04:23:12.750 --> 04:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh a com commission study found that the
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
out of- pocket cost for patients to be
 
04:23:17.790 --> 04:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
high for example um this average patient
 
04:23:20.830 --> 04:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
cost for a mamogram is $234 and for a
 
04:23:22.830 --> 04:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
breast MRI around
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
$1,100 we often receive calls and emails
 
04:23:27.229 --> 04:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
from individuals who are unable to
 
04:23:28.950 --> 04:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
afford the out of pocket cost for their
 
04:23:31.070 --> 04:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
recommended breast Imaging without
 
04:23:32.830 --> 04:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
assistance many will simply delay or
 
04:23:35.189 --> 04:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
foro these medically necessary tests
 
04:23:36.870 --> 04:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
this delay can mean that patients will
 
04:23:39.389 --> 04:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
not see care until the cancer has spread
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
making it much more deadly deadlier and
 
04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
much more costly to treat and we know
 
04:23:45.309 --> 04:23:45.319 align:start position:0%
that breast cancer can be up to five
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
times more expensive to treat when it
 
04:23:48.590 --> 04:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
has spread beyond the breast to other
 
04:23:51.149 --> 04:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
parts of the body um so simply put this
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
is a cost savings bill that will save
 
04:23:54.550 --> 04:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
the cost not only for the patients but
 
04:23:56.309 --> 04:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
also for the overall New Hampshire
 
04:23:58.750 --> 04:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
Health Care System I'd like to share a
 
04:24:00.670 --> 04:24:00.680 align:start position:0%
story from a patient who came to us
 
04:24:03.070 --> 04:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
after uh she decided not to get the
 
04:24:05.670 --> 04:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
diagnostic test because of an $80 co-pay
 
04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
she said that $80 might as well have
 
04:24:10.510 --> 04:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
been $88,000 she was a single mother
 
04:24:12.790 --> 04:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
trying to make ends meet um until one
 
04:24:15.070 --> 04:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
day her cat had jumped onto her chest
 
04:24:17.429 --> 04:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
and she was in so much pain she decided
 
04:24:19.229 --> 04:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
to take out a payday loan which ended up
 
04:24:21.510 --> 04:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
being more costly than the initial
 
04:24:24.149 --> 04:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
$80 um just so she can get the
 
04:24:26.189 --> 04:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
diagnostic test and then she was
 
04:24:27.790 --> 04:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately diagnosed with breast
 
04:24:30.670 --> 04:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
cancer um and because of her late stage
 
04:24:32.790 --> 04:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
diagnosis she had to receive chemo and
 
04:24:35.429 --> 04:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
radiation as well as surgery um to
 
04:24:37.590 --> 04:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
remove both of her her breast uh if she
 
04:24:39.269 --> 04:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
was able to afford the diagnostic test
 
04:24:41.189 --> 04:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
earlier her physician said she may not
 
04:24:43.229 --> 04:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
have needed the surgery and may not have
 
04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
lost her breast and her treatment
 
04:24:46.990 --> 04:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
overall would have been less costly
 
04:24:49.229 --> 04:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
stories like this one are not uncommon
 
04:24:52.189 --> 04:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
um you know as you know uh as the
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh mentioned earlier uh
 
04:24:57.550 --> 04:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
you know uh talking um sorry to switch
 
04:24:59.630 --> 04:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
to the financial lens the study was done
 
04:25:02.349 --> 04:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts that uh showed that
 
04:25:04.269 --> 04:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
this bill would have a negligible impact
 
04:25:06.550 --> 04:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
on members insurance premiums found that
 
04:25:08.189 --> 04:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
the typical members monthly health
 
04:25:10.389 --> 04:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
insurance premium to be between 19 cents
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
to 33 cents per member per month or
 
04:25:17.670 --> 04:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
between 03 to six 0 6% of the premium um
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know I like to say that's you know
 
04:25:21.670 --> 04:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
basically the price of a small coffee
 
04:25:25.109 --> 04:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
per year um and also this bill will help
 
04:25:26.910 --> 04:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
breast cancer survivors who need to go
 
04:25:29.309 --> 04:25:29.319 align:start position:0%
for routine follow-up Imaging so it's
 
04:25:32.790 --> 04:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
not just um you know for an a diagnosis
 
04:25:35.469 --> 04:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
early on but also for continuing um care
 
04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
for Survivor as well uh you know as
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
committed Partners in the fight against
 
04:25:41.710 --> 04:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
bre breast cancer we know how deeply
 
04:25:43.630 --> 04:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
important it is for all cancer patients
 
04:25:45.389 --> 04:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
to have fair and Equitable access to
 
04:25:48.349 --> 04:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
breast Imaging um that may save their
 
04:25:51.710 --> 04:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
lives so we urge you to support hb1 1296
 
04:25:54.630 --> 04:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
and pass this critical legislation um as
 
04:25:56.109 --> 04:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned 20 other states have already
 
04:25:58.229 --> 04:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
passed it and New Hampshire should be
 
04:26:01.309 --> 04:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
the next one thank you for your
 
04:26:04.910 --> 04:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
time okay questions representative Terry
 
04:26:09.910 --> 04:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you um just want to um have
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
a a broader understanding of um what it
 
04:26:16.870 --> 04:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
is that you're describing um is it is it
 
04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
not uncommon
 
04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
for um for someone to have multiple
 
04:26:28.229 --> 04:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
additional uh imagings like so you have
 
04:26:30.550 --> 04:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
the mammogram then you might need one
 
04:26:31.950 --> 04:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
then you might need a second one then
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
you might need a third one so is it
 
04:26:37.109 --> 04:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
typical is it is it not on uncommon to
 
04:26:40.950 --> 04:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
have more than one followup Imaging and
 
04:26:43.590 --> 04:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
then the second question is um we just
 
04:26:47.750 --> 04:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
start with that one okay sure um so I
 
04:26:49.030 --> 04:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
will say we do have a physician here
 
04:26:52.389 --> 04:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
today who can answer um that more um
 
04:26:55.189 --> 04:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
more in depth than I can but um I you
 
04:26:56.950 --> 04:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
know mography like I said the mography
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
is really just the tip of the iceberg
 
04:27:01.070 --> 04:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
and then the follow-up testing about 16%
 
04:27:02.910 --> 04:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
of patients will fall into that category
 
04:27:05.550 --> 04:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
who need a followup and um again I'm not
 
04:27:06.429 --> 04:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
a physican
 
04:27:08.229 --> 04:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
but it you know it could be likely that
 
04:27:10.830 --> 04:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
you would need multiple maybe you know
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
two diagnostic tests a year after that
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
or um but you can ask her to you know
 
04:27:19.070 --> 04:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
you can ask her your question as well
 
04:27:22.229 --> 04:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
fur the question yeah so uh in short
 
04:27:24.790 --> 04:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
your answer is you believe that it's not
 
04:27:27.630 --> 04:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
uncommon to have more than one yes okay
 
04:27:29.950 --> 04:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
so the other question is uh typically
 
04:27:31.710 --> 04:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
when we are talking about Commercial
 
04:27:33.469 --> 04:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
Insurance we're talking about a
 
04:27:37.149 --> 04:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
contracted price so that for for example
 
04:27:40.189 --> 04:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
a retail price might be like 5,000 and
 
04:27:42.950 --> 04:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
then when the insurance company uh has a
 
04:27:44.990 --> 04:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
contract it might be something like
 
04:27:48.070 --> 04:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
2,000 or 3,000 are we typically talking
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
about contracted price here with respect
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
to co-payments and and and and is it is
 
04:27:56.189 --> 04:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
it typical 8020 like it is with many
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
insurance plans so that the numbers that
 
04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
you're giving us are numbers that are
 
04:28:06.229 --> 04:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
based off of contractual amounts
 
04:28:08.349 --> 04:28:08.359 align:start position:0%
negotiated between insurance companies
 
04:28:10.109 --> 04:28:10.119 align:start position:0%
and providers and then that's the
 
04:28:14.670 --> 04:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
remaining typical co-pay that the uh the
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
patient has to pay like a 20% yeah I
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
mean I would I would defer to an
 
04:28:21.590 --> 04:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
insurance company with that specific
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
question um I can't speak at length on
 
04:28:26.030 --> 04:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
it and I can get back to so you have the
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
numbers but you're not sure how they're
 
04:28:29.469 --> 04:28:29.479 align:start position:0%
well that's from the study that's I can
 
04:28:30.870 --> 04:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
share that with you as but you're not
 
04:28:32.070 --> 04:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
sure how they're derived and you're
 
04:28:33.670 --> 04:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
suggesting we should ask the insurance
 
04:28:35.950 --> 04:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
companies about how those number how how
 
04:28:38.109 --> 04:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
those numbers were arrived
 
04:28:41.109 --> 04:28:41.119 align:start position:0%
at no I'm I'm well no we have the study
 
04:28:43.670 --> 04:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
I can share that with you but I don't I
 
04:28:45.309 --> 04:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer for you off the
 
04:28:47.070 --> 04:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
top of my head but I'm happy to follow
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
up with you after so you have the cost
 
04:28:49.750 --> 04:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
but you're not sure how they were
 
04:28:52.030 --> 04:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
arrived at question those are the cost
 
04:28:54.269 --> 04:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
just clarifying okay but I I think I got
 
04:28:56.429 --> 04:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
it you're I think you're right there
 
04:28:58.670 --> 04:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're really warm and and I'm
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
not sure you want to answer this
 
04:29:02.510 --> 04:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
question but but here's what I think the
 
04:29:05.349 --> 04:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
question is yep so what we're asking
 
04:29:07.710 --> 04:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
right now we know that mammographies are
 
04:29:11.309 --> 04:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
covered yeah with no co-pays or
 
04:29:13.630 --> 04:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
deductibles but if you are actually
 
04:29:18.910 --> 04:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
dignosed or the second yes now all of a
 
04:29:22.389 --> 04:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
sudden the patients co-pays and
 
04:29:26.790 --> 04:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
deductibles of their plan kicks in so if
 
04:29:28.670 --> 04:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
you're an employee with a very high
 
04:29:31.750 --> 04:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
deductible plan right well that's the
 
04:29:34.269 --> 04:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
one who's paying the, because for all
 
04:29:36.910 --> 04:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
intensive purposes they're paying the
 
04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
whole thing so here's my question MH
 
04:29:44.269 --> 04:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
isn't this true for all cancers yes but
 
04:29:46.070 --> 04:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
I will say this um doesn't include the
 
04:29:48.389 --> 04:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
deductibles so that part you don't need
 
04:29:49.830 --> 04:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
right what I'm saying yes this is
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
basically saying if you're diagnosed
 
04:29:53.469 --> 04:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
with cancer I mean this is It's called
 
04:29:55.349 --> 04:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
this the Campbell's nose Under the Tent
 
04:29:58.269 --> 04:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
If you're diagnosed with cancer then o
 
04:30:01.790 --> 04:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
any other diagnostic tests going forward
 
04:30:03.109 --> 04:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
those people are going to come in and
 
04:30:07.429 --> 04:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
say we want that same exemption for
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
cancer I will I will defer to um the
 
04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
medical professional but I will say not
 
04:30:15.309 --> 04:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
all cancers are diagnosed the same it's
 
04:30:17.950 --> 04:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
different so with breast cancer you can
 
04:30:20.429 --> 04:30:20.439 align:start position:0%
get detected early um through this
 
04:30:22.109 --> 04:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
process and you know we know that one
 
04:30:25.349 --> 04:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
in8 women will get breast cancer so it
 
04:30:28.910 --> 04:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
is one of the leading um diseases for
 
04:30:32.349 --> 04:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
women got it all right
 
04:30:35.389 --> 04:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
representative spear I was going to say
 
04:30:37.710 --> 04:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
bro us cuz I think our hand up was
 
04:30:39.710 --> 04:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
before you but I could hear you
 
04:30:42.269 --> 04:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
commenting over there and now I'm
 
04:30:45.070 --> 04:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
confused okay uh thank you very much
 
04:30:45.080 --> 04:30:48.349 align:start position:0%
confused okay uh thank you very much
chairman

04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:50.870 --> 04:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
you my understanding of what you're
 
04:30:53.109 --> 04:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
saying is that these costs are
 
04:30:55.550 --> 04:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
associated with even before you find out
 
04:30:58.269 --> 04:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
if you have cancer it's not you don't
 
04:31:00.870 --> 04:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
know that you have cancer yet yeah so
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's not like any other cancer patient
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
you still don't know all they know is
 
04:31:07.870 --> 04:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
they have have inconclusive data and you
 
04:31:10.070 --> 04:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
have some shown some
 
04:31:12.309 --> 04:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
risks so we're trying to go to the next
 
04:31:15.510 --> 04:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
step now once you have cancer in I
 
04:31:17.349 --> 04:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
understanding correct correct then a
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
whole another thing kicks in right thank
 
04:31:24.189 --> 04:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Bros yeah I have a
 
04:31:25.950 --> 04:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
question because it it says Women's

healthc Care how do men also have this
 
04:31:33.189 --> 04:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
need yes it's not as um it's not as
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
common in men but yes this does apply to
 
04:31:37.469 --> 04:31:37.479 align:start position:0%
men as well and and would it also apply
 
04:31:40.750 --> 04:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
to say a trans man who has not yet had
 
04:31:43.309 --> 04:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
um gender gender surgery yes when I say
 
04:31:46.510 --> 04:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
the word woman um I'm all inclusive with
 
04:31:48.189 --> 04:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
those who identify as okay so they would
 
04:31:51.189 --> 04:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
be covered thank you
 
04:31:53.389 --> 04:31:53.399 align:start position:0%

call on Heidi
colls

04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:04.479 --> 04:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:07.990 --> 04:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
so did I get it right Hy what this is
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
about is after the first test
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
every test therea is now susceptible to
 
04:32:18.070 --> 04:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
high deductibles and
 
04:32:20.830 --> 04:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
co-pays right good afternoon Mr chairman
 
04:32:22.109 --> 04:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I'm for the
 
04:32:24.189 --> 04:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
record my name is Heidi croll I work at
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
Gallagher Callahan and gartell and I
 
04:32:28.109 --> 04:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
represent ahip which is America's health
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
insurance plans
 
04:32:36.429 --> 04:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
um so to answer your question um my
 
04:32:38.109 --> 04:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the services that
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
are being discussed here the um
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
04:32:46.469 --> 04:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
diagnostic um and other I'm looking for
 
04:32:49.750 --> 04:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
the language here uh SC followup um
 
04:32:51.870 --> 04:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic and supplemental breast
 
04:32:51.880 --> 04:32:54.309 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic and supplemental breast
examinations

04:32:54.309 --> 04:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
examinations
 
04:32:57.590 --> 04:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
so those would be covered but if you
 
04:32:57.600 --> 04:32:58.469 align:start position:0%
so those would be covered but if you
have

04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
not met your deductible then you would
 
04:33:06.189 --> 04:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
pay the negotiated contract Ed rate that
 
04:33:08.629 --> 04:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
the carrier has with the providers of
 
04:33:11.670 --> 04:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
these services and if you have met your
 
04:33:13.869 --> 04:33:13.879 align:start position:0%
du deductible or once you've met your
 
04:33:16.990 --> 04:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
deductible then you would pay a co-pay
 
04:33:19.590 --> 04:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
or co- Insurance depending on the design
 
04:33:25.629 --> 04:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
of your plan um so um you are correct
 
04:33:28.109 --> 04:33:28.119 align:start position:0%
that um one of the concerns that we have
 
04:33:30.629 --> 04:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
with this bill we we understand the
 
04:33:32.269 --> 04:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
intention and it's certainly well
 
04:33:36.189 --> 04:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
intentioned um but to the extent that
 
04:33:39.830 --> 04:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
um so as you mentioned uh preventative
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
Services Under the Affordable Care Act
 
04:33:45.510 --> 04:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
are provided um without any cost sharing
 
04:33:45.520 --> 04:33:46.990 align:start position:0%
are provided um without any cost sharing
um

04:33:46.990 --> 04:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
but uh Services considered to be non
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
preventative are um are are allowed to
 
04:33:56.551 --> 04:33:56.561 align:start position:0%
have cost sharing and um and often do
 
04:33:59.029 --> 04:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
and so the issue is that if we start
 
04:34:02.910 --> 04:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
removing cost sharing um from these
 
04:34:06.429 --> 04:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
types of services those costs need to be
 
04:34:08.830 --> 04:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
collected from somewhere and so they
 
04:34:10.269 --> 04:34:10.279 align:start position:0%
will either be collected through
 
04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
premiums or through other cost sharing
 
04:34:17.750 --> 04:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
services um the other thing I was going
 
04:34:24.029 --> 04:34:24.039 align:start position:0%
to mention um this is uh a bill that
 
04:34:28.109 --> 04:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
would apply to um the individual and uh
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
small group and large group um fully
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
insured plans so it does not apply to um
 
04:34:37.551 --> 04:34:37.561 align:start position:0%
self-funded plans does not apply to
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
employers who are out of state um
 
04:34:42.150 --> 04:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
without brick and mortar here in New
 
04:34:42.160 --> 04:34:44.709 align:start position:0%
without brick and mortar here in New
Hampshire

04:34:44.709 --> 04:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:34:47.470 --> 04:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
um and as I mentioned earlier today in
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
testimony um the individual Market is
 
04:34:52.869 --> 04:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
somewhere around six or so percent of
 
04:34:55.869 --> 04:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
the all of the insurance markets and the
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
um small and large group are somewhere
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
in the 20 to
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
21% um so uh for example the fully
 
04:35:03.590 --> 04:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
insured Market here in New Hampshire is
 
04:35:08.109 --> 04:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
34% so this law would not apply to them
 
04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
um I did notice that there was no fiscal
 
04:35:13.670 --> 04:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
note I thought that was interesting um I
 
04:35:15.029 --> 04:35:15.039 align:start position:0%
don't know if this was sent to the
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
insurance department or not um also in
 
04:35:21.670 --> 04:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
terms of the effective date UH 60 days
 
04:35:24.830 --> 04:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
after passage as you know whenever um we
 
04:35:27.269 --> 04:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
have mandate review or mandate bills we
 
04:35:28.670 --> 04:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
at least try to have them have an
 
04:35:30.910 --> 04:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
effective date if it's the committee's
 
04:35:32.750 --> 04:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
um inclined to pass a bill to have an
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
effective date that syncs up with the
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
start start of the planed year which
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
would be January
 
04:35:37.760 --> 04:35:39.390 align:start position:0%
would be January
1st

04:35:39.390 --> 04:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
1st
 
04:35:41.789 --> 04:35:41.799 align:start position:0%
um but you know I guess I would just
 
04:35:43.949 --> 04:35:43.959 align:start position:0%
reiterate that um
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
coverage when a plan covers services
 
04:35:48.750 --> 04:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean that the
 
04:35:50.150 --> 04:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
services are
 
04:35:53.189 --> 04:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
free straight out of the gate some of
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
them have no cost share some of them
 
04:35:57.510 --> 04:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
have cost share and deductibles need to
 
04:35:57.520 --> 04:35:59.510 align:start position:0%
have cost share and deductibles need to
be

04:35:59.510 --> 04:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
met and I'd be happy to try to answer
 
04:36:01.680 --> 04:36:02.949 align:start position:0%
met and I'd be happy to try to answer
any

04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:11.189 --> 04:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
spear so the thank you uh the Susan
 
04:36:16.029 --> 04:36:16.039 align:start position:0%
colan Foundation sent me a
 
04:36:19.470 --> 04:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
huge analysis of the
 
04:36:22.269 --> 04:36:22.279 align:start position:0%
cost which I take it to be in substitute
 
04:36:24.310 --> 04:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
of the uh fiscal note because it has
 
04:36:27.390 --> 04:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
excruciating detail down to the penny as
 
04:36:30.269 --> 04:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
to what this costs in Massachusetts and
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
backup data that shows why it's only 13
 
04:36:36.349 --> 04:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
to 33 cents
 
04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's probably a better analysis than
 
04:36:42.269 --> 04:36:42.279 align:start position:0%
I've seen typically in our fiscal notes
 
04:36:45.150 --> 04:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
so my question is have you received this
 
04:36:48.029 --> 04:36:48.039 align:start position:0%
information and is there a reason at all
 
04:36:50.269 --> 04:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
that you can find 20 States who have
 
04:36:52.830 --> 04:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
agreed with it to be invalid and that
 
04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
for 13 cents or 33 cents we couldn't
 
04:36:59.629 --> 04:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
push the premiums up a little tiny bit
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
so I have not seen that report um and at
 
04:37:04.269 --> 04:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
the end of the day this is a policy
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
decision for for legislators to make um
 
04:37:09.709 --> 04:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
my understanding for example in Maine is
 
04:37:10.990 --> 04:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
that they considered this leg
 
04:37:13.949 --> 04:37:13.959 align:start position:0%
legislation they clarified the coverage
 
04:37:16.750 --> 04:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
um but went ahead with no um they didn't
 
04:37:19.590 --> 04:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
impose the no cost sharing requirement
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
um but at the end of the day this is a
 
04:37:23.390 --> 04:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
policy decision for you to make it's
 
04:37:26.470 --> 04:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
just um to keep in mind the market share
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
that this would apply to so often we see
 
04:37:31.310 --> 04:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
mandates passed and then you know the
 
04:37:33.189 --> 04:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
insurance department or the carriers or
 
04:37:35.230 --> 04:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
legislators or somebody get get a
 
04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
complaint that says we passed this
 
04:37:39.629 --> 04:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
mandate and I'm still I'm still paying
 
04:37:41.470 --> 04:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
out of pocket you know I'm still paying
 
04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
or it's not free or it's not a cost you
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
know I'm paying a co-pay or whatever the
 
04:37:48.150 --> 04:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
case may be and it's just to remember
 
04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
that there is a other markets out there
 
04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
that this um mandate would not apply to
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and then also to keep in mind that
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
when you lift um cost sharing from
 
04:38:04.990 --> 04:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
Services um where the ACA doesn't say no
 
04:38:07.029 --> 04:38:07.039 align:start position:0%
cost sharing you are going to get other
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
folks coming in with their mandates as
 
04:38:11.629 --> 04:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
the chairman was mentioning earlier
 
04:38:14.269 --> 04:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
other other constituents will come in
 
04:38:17.070 --> 04:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
and look for cost sharing to be removed
 
04:38:19.310 --> 04:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
from um other services and it's just at
 
04:38:20.990 --> 04:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
some point
 
04:38:24.189 --> 04:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
um you know access to um health
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
insurance um often starts with is the
 
04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
premium affordable so and these are you
 
04:38:31.590 --> 04:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
know again this is going to hit um I'm
 
04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
not saying the 13 to whatever senses a
 
04:38:35.670 --> 04:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
lot um but this this is uh the
 
04:38:38.869 --> 04:38:38.879 align:start position:0%
individual and the small and the
 
04:38:40.869 --> 04:38:40.879 align:start position:0%
Employers in New Hampshire that are ful
 
04:38:41.949 --> 04:38:41.959 align:start position:0%
follow one
 
04:38:44.949 --> 04:38:44.959 align:start position:0%
question further question may
 
04:38:48.150 --> 04:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
inquire based on the uh cancer uh
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
statistics New Hampshire has among the
 
04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
highest cancer rate in the
 
04:38:57.869 --> 04:38:57.879 align:start position:0%
country uh for breast
 
04:39:01.590 --> 04:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
cancer that kind of puts it in a class
 
04:39:06.029 --> 04:39:06.039 align:start position:0%
by itself to me and it affects
 
04:39:08.670 --> 04:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
my sister lives here and she ended up
 
04:39:11.150 --> 04:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
with breast cancer at the age of 32 and
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
lost both breasts because she did not
 
04:39:15.869 --> 04:39:15.879 align:start position:0%
get it diagnosed early
 
04:39:19.070 --> 04:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
enough uh it puts it in a class by
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
itself don't you
 
04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
think that it has to be looked at in an
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
environment of who it
 
04:39:29.590 --> 04:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
impacts and to the extent that this
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
state is being impacted by this disease
 
04:39:35.910 --> 04:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
and we should make every every effort to
 
04:39:37.310 --> 04:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
try and
 
04:39:40.708 --> 04:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
stop the much more costly effects of
 
04:39:42.910 --> 04:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
having the women go or the women or
 
04:39:44.830 --> 04:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
whoever has to go to it and by the way
 
04:39:46.948 --> 04:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
my husband had to get an MRI and that
 
04:39:50.750 --> 04:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:54.390 --> 04:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
funny to go through the effects of this
 
04:39:56.230 --> 04:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
so I I think it puts it in a class by
 
04:39:58.390 --> 04:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
itself or do you not
 
04:40:01.510 --> 04:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
think it's a as as I said it's a policy
 
04:40:03.470 --> 04:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
decision for the committee you make good
 
04:40:05.190 --> 04:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
points I I don't disagree with what
 
04:40:07.390 --> 04:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying I think it's just to be
 
04:40:11.788 --> 04:40:11.798 align:start position:0%
aware that um once you and you can make
 
04:40:13.230 --> 04:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
this decision it's obviously up to the
 
04:40:15.510 --> 04:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
legislature but when you lift the cost
 
04:40:18.590 --> 04:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
sharing on certain Services um others
 
04:40:20.550 --> 04:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
are going to come in and look for for
 
04:40:23.550 --> 04:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
that to um apply to whatever set of
 
04:40:25.788 --> 04:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
services um is associated with the
 
04:40:29.350 --> 04:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
Mandate that's important to them and so
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
um it will eventually like I said those
 
04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
costs have to go someplace I'm not
 
04:40:35.510 --> 04:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
saying that the the the costs that are
 
04:40:37.708 --> 04:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
cited in the study are going to be a big
 
04:40:39.628 --> 04:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
impact but it could have a cumulative
 
04:40:43.948 --> 04:40:43.958 align:start position:0%
effect so representative Amon thank you
 
04:40:45.708 --> 04:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for coming and giving
 
04:40:48.750 --> 04:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony um I'm trying to think
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
about this in terms of how free market
 
04:40:55.070 --> 04:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
forces operate um so mandate is
 
04:40:58.390 --> 04:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
obviously uh a legislative prescription
 
04:41:02.070 --> 04:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
and it shifts the costs from a a large
 
04:41:05.670 --> 04:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
group of rate payers of policy uh payers
 
04:41:08.030 --> 04:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
to a small group so there there is a
 
04:41:10.750 --> 04:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
cost but it's dispersed um but as far as
 
04:41:13.708 --> 04:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
the insurance company's calculation on
 
04:41:15.788 --> 04:41:15.798 align:start position:0%
if a person stays alive longer they can
 
04:41:17.628 --> 04:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
pay premiums longer right there's an
 
04:41:20.590 --> 04:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
incentive for keeping patients alive
 
04:41:22.868 --> 04:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
what kind of calculation do insurance
 
04:41:25.430 --> 04:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
companies do that if there is a
 
04:41:27.750 --> 04:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
preventative uh care that can save money
 
04:41:29.150 --> 04:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
down the road because it prevents the
 
04:41:30.628 --> 04:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
spread of cancer to other parts of the
 
04:41:33.670 --> 04:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
body uh you know more severe damage how
 
04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
how does that uh factored in in your in
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
your profit calculations right um if you
 
04:41:42.510 --> 04:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
could explain
 
04:41:44.708 --> 04:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
that so I'm not sure that insurance
 
04:41:46.270 --> 04:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
companies are looking at the lifespan
 
04:41:48.350 --> 04:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
and how long people are going to um pay
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
premiums I would say that insurance
 
04:41:51.670 --> 04:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
companies absolutely want to keep people
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
healthy and you know um pay for services
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
that are less expensive that are going
 
04:41:58.868 --> 04:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
to keep people healthier so that we
 
04:42:01.590 --> 04:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
avoid um people getting sicker and
 
04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
people having more costly care um and so
 
04:42:07.430 --> 04:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely I don't I don't dis I don't
 
04:42:09.430 --> 04:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
think any carrier would disagree with
 
04:42:10.948 --> 04:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
trying to keep people healthy at the end
 
04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
of the day um this is in part boils down
 
04:42:17.670 --> 04:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
to benefit design and so the other thing
 
04:42:19.788 --> 04:42:19.798 align:start position:0%
I would say is that um you know
 
04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
different different carriers offer
 
04:42:24.910 --> 04:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
different plans with different
 
04:42:27.070 --> 04:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a it's a it's a
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
balancing act right you can have um
 
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
lower lower premiums and higher co-pays
 
04:42:33.430 --> 04:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
or you can have higher premiums and
 
04:42:36.230 --> 04:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
lower co-pays and so um there there is
 
04:42:37.788 --> 04:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
some Choice out in the marketplace as
 
04:42:39.390 --> 04:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
well for people especially in the
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
individual Market um with deciding
 
04:42:44.910 --> 04:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
what's what they can afford where they
 
04:42:46.948 --> 04:42:46.958 align:start position:0%
want to whether they want to pay higher
 
04:42:49.310 --> 04:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
premiums and lower co-pays or vice versa
 
04:42:51.390 --> 04:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
um so is there's that choice too but no
 
04:42:53.550 --> 04:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
I absolutely agree with you that um at
 
04:42:54.750 --> 04:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
the end of the day we're trying to keep
 
04:42:56.150 --> 04:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
people healthy and this is a policy
 
04:42:56.160 --> 04:42:58.390 align:start position:0%
people healthy and this is a policy
decision

04:42:58.390 --> 04:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:43:00.670 --> 04:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
04:43:04.030 --> 04:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
s so this is kind of a followup um this
 
04:43:05.550 --> 04:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
is now what the second Bill we've heard
 
04:43:08.390 --> 04:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
in today that the same argument has been
 
04:43:11.390 --> 04:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
made that if we do this this will lead
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
to lower cost savings
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
for you know because we're it's
 
04:43:17.550 --> 04:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
preventative the last one was about
 
04:43:19.430 --> 04:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
glucose monitoring and now we're talking
 
04:43:21.868 --> 04:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
about breast cancer um
 
04:43:24.868 --> 04:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
so does anybody in this room has anybody
 
04:43:27.070 --> 04:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
actually studied this or are people just
 
04:43:29.390 --> 04:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
saying it because if you know I hear a
 
04:43:30.910 --> 04:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
lot of numbers maybe it's in this report
 
04:43:33.070 --> 04:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
which I don't think I've I received but
 
04:43:34.230 --> 04:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if anybody's actually
 
04:43:35.590 --> 04:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
looking looked into this to kind of be
 
04:43:37.390 --> 04:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
able to provide some insight because
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's been spouted but nobody shared
 
04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
anything with this committee that I'm
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
aware of aside from asserting something
 
04:43:45.350 --> 04:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
and I would love to just see that I'm
 
04:43:46.350 --> 04:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
not saying that we should be making
 
04:43:47.868 --> 04:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
decisions based on a cost benefit
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
analysis of a life but if that's going
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
to be part of the argument of why we
 
04:43:52.470 --> 04:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
should Implement something then I would
 
04:43:53.948 --> 04:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
like to see some of the evidence behind
 
04:43:56.550 --> 04:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
it and so this is sort of a if you have
 
04:43:58.350 --> 04:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
it I'd love to share it if you're the
 
04:43:59.788 --> 04:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
people that you represent have it or
 
04:44:00.628 --> 04:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
some of the other people who have
 
04:44:02.470 --> 04:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
testified have it I would love to get my
 
04:44:04.868 --> 04:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
hands on it so I can dig into it sort of
 
04:44:09.190 --> 04:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
would you believe I guess
 
04:44:12.070 --> 04:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
um I can see what we we have on that
 
04:44:15.750 --> 04:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:18.270 --> 04:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
think there are probably you know
 
04:44:20.670 --> 04:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
benefits down the road by you know doing
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
something earlier and and preventing
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
something more costly down the road um
 
04:44:27.190 --> 04:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
so there's the time factor in here as
 
04:44:30.868 --> 04:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
well but you know at least in the early
 
04:44:33.270 --> 04:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
part of this you would have the cost
 
04:44:35.350 --> 04:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
being shifted from from the smaller
 
04:44:40.510 --> 04:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:44.190 --> 04:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
um without the immediate benefits I
 
04:44:47.788 --> 04:44:47.798 align:start position:0%
guess so uh represent selvan and I I'll
 
04:44:49.948 --> 04:44:49.958 align:start position:0%
I'll I haven't we haven't done it in a
 
04:44:52.350 --> 04:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
long time actually since Pam sming so
 
04:44:54.708 --> 04:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
I'll have it done but the list all the
 
04:44:56.110 --> 04:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
04:44:59.430 --> 04:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
mandates and I have to admit that the
 
04:45:02.110 --> 04:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
Lion Share literally almost 90% happened
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
while I was here so but and and I say
 
04:45:08.190 --> 04:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
this on that I've never met a health
 
04:45:10.150 --> 04:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
insurance mandate that we've gotten and
 
04:45:13.590 --> 04:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
we have like 30 40 of them that the
 
04:45:16.510 --> 04:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
premise always was that this is better
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
long-term consequently longterm everyone
 
04:45:21.070 --> 04:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's always a premise and
 
04:45:23.470 --> 04:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
what's the reason we have it okay now
 
04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
this one is a little unusual uh this
 
04:45:28.390 --> 04:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
one's very different to me first of all
 
04:45:29.750 --> 04:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh I've never seen a billing where the
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
definitions are secondary to the actual
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
structure of a lot it's kind of upside
 
04:45:37.190 --> 04:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
down but not withstanding that I'm I'm
 
04:45:41.230 --> 04:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
working my way through this and I guess
 
04:45:44.708 --> 04:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
I way I read it this is a onot
 
04:45:48.270 --> 04:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
deal it you know in terms of that you
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
you some woman's had a mography and and
 
04:45:55.390 --> 04:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
then and or had or actually says based
 
04:45:57.230 --> 04:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
on personal family history that words if
 
04:45:59.390 --> 04:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
you have breast cancer in your personal
 
04:46:02.628 --> 04:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
family that you can request to have
 
04:46:07.230 --> 04:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
this um I guess it's more uh I assume
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's the you know the the the high
 
04:46:12.910 --> 04:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
definition the 3D uh machine doing the
 
04:46:16.110 --> 04:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
the breast exam um and but I I'm not
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
sure how many times you can ask for it
 
04:46:21.510 --> 04:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
how many times it does it's not clear
 
04:46:23.750 --> 04:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
whether this is multiple so I'm you know
 
04:46:26.470 --> 04:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
when you say state of Massachusetts only
 
04:46:29.110 --> 04:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
has 131 19 cents but it it appears maybe
 
04:46:31.590 --> 04:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
that was it was a one-hot deal and you
 
04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
get this done and then uh and through
 
04:46:36.070 --> 04:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
ically you don't need to do it again I
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't how that works but
 
04:46:41.470 --> 04:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
I'm intrigued when you said that Maine
 
04:46:44.510 --> 04:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
narrowed it with did they they remove
 
04:46:46.230 --> 04:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
the cost sharing requirements or what
 
04:46:49.150 --> 04:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
did they how did they narrow it so this
 
04:46:50.830 --> 04:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
is subject to check but my understanding
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
is that Maine had a similar piece of
 
04:46:55.270 --> 04:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
legislation they they ended up I think
 
04:46:57.708 --> 04:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
subject to check clarifying about the
 
04:47:01.948 --> 04:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
coverage of um Diagnostic and
 
04:47:04.670 --> 04:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
supplemental breast examinations so
 
04:47:07.510 --> 04:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
ensuring that those would be covered but
 
04:47:10.670 --> 04:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
they did not move forward with the idea
 
04:47:12.590 --> 04:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
that it would that there would um they
 
04:47:14.470 --> 04:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
impose any you know they can't impose
 
04:47:17.070 --> 04:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
any cost sharing requirements they they
 
04:47:19.470 --> 04:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
didn't go so they said do that they said
 
04:47:20.670 --> 04:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
yes you can have but they did pick up
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
this language here where someone could
 
04:47:24.750 --> 04:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
ask for it based on their family history
 
04:47:26.750 --> 04:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
for instance uh that part I don't know
 
04:47:30.470 --> 04:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
I'd have to double check so okay now
 
04:47:32.350 --> 04:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
because in New Hampshire we give you one
 
04:47:36.750 --> 04:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
free mon me a year and I know one time
 
04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
we had a debate whether that was a year
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
at a day or you know that was one of our
 
04:47:45.548 --> 04:47:45.558 align:start position:0%
debated issues um so so in this case
 
04:47:50.430 --> 04:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
this this is um again the narrowed in
 
04:47:54.470 --> 04:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
what the idea of this is is that um it
 
04:47:57.548 --> 04:47:57.558 align:start position:0%
would remove any cost
 
04:48:01.270 --> 04:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
sharing from the bill which obviously I
 
04:48:03.310 --> 04:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
mean that people with a high deductible
 
04:48:05.470 --> 04:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
plan that says a lot of money if someone
 
04:48:07.510 --> 04:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a high deductible plan that
 
04:48:08.868 --> 04:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
saves some
 
04:48:11.390 --> 04:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
money got it right and the other thing I
 
04:48:13.110 --> 04:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
would say
 
04:48:15.470 --> 04:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I think it's important to
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that the um the definitions
 
04:48:21.470 --> 04:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
that are given in here I mean medical
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
necessity always applies even in the
 
04:48:26.190 --> 04:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
cases of mandates um that we're follow
 
04:48:29.230 --> 04:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
following you know um medical necessity
 
04:48:31.788 --> 04:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
guidelines and so those guidelines are
 
04:48:33.750 --> 04:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
continuously evolving um we had to
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
discuss discussion about those this
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
morning in terms of um the carriers you
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
know have independent panels that look
 
04:48:38.638 --> 04:48:40.390 align:start position:0%
know have independent panels that look
to

04:48:40.390 --> 04:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:48:44.830 --> 04:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
um National um experts and professionals
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
who um always are uh upgrading whatever
 
04:48:48.480 --> 04:48:49.628 align:start position:0%
who um always are uh upgrading whatever
the

04:48:49.628 --> 04:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
um best practices are so um I think we
 
04:48:55.670 --> 04:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure um that we're not
 
04:48:58.030 --> 04:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
putting anything in the um in the
 
04:49:01.830 --> 04:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
definitions that would kind of lock in
 
04:49:04.030 --> 04:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
whereas we we really do want Medical
 
04:49:06.910 --> 04:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
necessity to be able to evolve with the
 
04:49:08.830 --> 04:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
expert opinions that are out
 
04:49:12.510 --> 04:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
there okay great thank you now um there
 
04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
was some comment there's a physician I
 
04:49:16.430 --> 04:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
don't see any but who who Who's The
 
04:49:20.470 --> 04:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
Physician so your name is come okay come
 
04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.920 --> 04:49:41.628 align:start position:0%
 
Eva

04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:41.638 --> 04:49:42.628 align:start position:0%
 
good

04:49:42.628 --> 04:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon hello can you hear me yes we
 
04:49:48.628 --> 04:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
can great um so I've submitted some
 
04:49:51.470 --> 04:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
written uh testimony online and there's
 
04:49:52.948 --> 04:49:52.958 align:start position:0%
a copy of it going
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
around um I thought I might sort of mix
 
04:49:57.470 --> 04:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
it up because there were a lot of
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
questions which I I might be the only
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
one in the room who's able to
 
04:50:04.590 --> 04:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
answer um that'd be great
 
04:50:07.990 --> 04:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay so my name is Dr Eva lier I am a
 
04:50:09.948 --> 04:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
Subs specialty Fellowship trained breast
 
04:50:11.628 --> 04:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
Imaging radiologist I've been in
 
04:50:14.948 --> 04:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
practice for 14 years uh most recently
 
04:50:17.470 --> 04:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
at my own clinic in
 
04:50:20.470 --> 04:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
Lee uh the scope of the problem I think
 
04:50:24.830 --> 04:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
has been discussed um we recommend that
 
04:50:26.788 --> 04:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
screening mammograms I I think there's
 
04:50:28.270 --> 04:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
some confusion between screening
 
04:50:30.190 --> 04:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
mammograms and diagnostic mammograms
 
04:50:31.868 --> 04:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
tomosynthesis 2D
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
mammograms um so we recommend screening
 
04:50:37.190 --> 04:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
mammograms for women beginning at age 40
 
04:50:40.350 --> 04:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
annually which as we've discussed here
 
04:50:42.910 --> 04:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
are um free without cost sharing to
 
04:50:46.230 --> 04:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
insure patients everything else after
 
04:50:48.430 --> 04:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
that is not free and it goes towards
 
04:50:51.150 --> 04:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
your deductible your co-pay um I'm now a
 
04:50:52.788 --> 04:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
small business owner myself so I can
 
04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
talk all sorts of business about trying
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
to go onto the individual Market or
 
04:50:58.230 --> 04:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
getting health insurance for my
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
employees and there were very few plans
 
04:51:02.830 --> 04:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
that were actually not high deductible
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
that were available to us um so just to
 
04:51:10.590 --> 04:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
go through some of the questions um I
 
04:51:13.030 --> 04:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
don't know of any facilities in our area
 
04:51:15.948 --> 04:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
in this this part of the state
 
04:51:18.990 --> 04:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
um maybe throughout the state that don't
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
do Tomo synthesis everything now is 2D
 
04:51:27.430 --> 04:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
3D so um everything is 2D 3D um
 
04:51:29.990 --> 04:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
screening is free diagnostic mammograms
 
04:51:32.910 --> 04:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
are mammograms um so when you come in if
 
04:51:34.510 --> 04:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
a thousand women have a screening
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
mamogram today in New Hampshire about a
 
04:51:38.628 --> 04:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
hundred of those women will be called
 
04:51:41.470 --> 04:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
back for an abnormality so everything
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
from that point for those 100 women is
 
04:51:45.510 --> 04:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
not free that's what goes towards the
 
04:51:47.990 --> 04:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
cost sharing um it could be an
 
04:51:50.788 --> 04:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
ultrasound you know maybe a few hundred
 
04:51:52.708 --> 04:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
a diagnostic mammogram is frequently
 
04:51:52.718 --> 04:51:53.830 align:start position:0%
a diagnostic mammogram is frequently
over

04:51:53.830 --> 04:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
$600 um could be as much as a thousand
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
um could be an MRI could be a
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
biopsy uh it happens really frequently
 
04:52:04.628 --> 04:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
that we're just not sure sure enough to
 
04:52:06.430 --> 04:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
Warrant a biopsy and so we recommend
 
04:52:08.430 --> 04:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up Imaging in 3 months or 6
 
04:52:11.430 --> 04:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
months so it's just a multi-step process
 
04:52:15.070 --> 04:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
and it is that way every year you
 
04:52:18.750 --> 04:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
know um what
 
04:52:21.750 --> 04:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
else so how when when you when you've
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
been diagnosed yeah how many times would
 
04:52:26.708 --> 04:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
you come back to get another screening
 
04:52:29.510 --> 04:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
it might be just once um so say you have
 
04:52:31.350 --> 04:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
a an abnormality on your screening
 
04:52:34.750 --> 04:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
mamogram um you'll be called back
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
for usually it's a diagnostic mamogram
 
04:52:40.230 --> 04:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
plus an ultrasound and then a
 
04:52:43.708 --> 04:52:43.718 align:start position:0%
biopsy um and then an
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
MRI and for every breast cancer
 
04:52:47.470 --> 04:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
diagnosis you're pretty much going to
 
04:52:50.708 --> 04:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
get the MRI which is around
 
04:52:54.190 --> 04:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
$2500 um and those are those are you
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
know we talked about the the contract
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
price might be $5,000 and it gets
 
04:53:00.948 --> 04:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
negotiated down depending on your pair
 
04:53:04.670 --> 04:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
um so that happens with everybody and
 
04:53:07.190 --> 04:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
then you go to surgery and after you
 
04:53:09.150 --> 04:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
have your breast cancer diagnosis you
 
04:53:11.830 --> 04:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
get put into the diagnostic pool for two
 
04:53:13.948 --> 04:53:13.958 align:start position:0%
to five years afterwards so you don't
 
04:53:15.590 --> 04:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
have a screening mamogram after that you
 
04:53:17.430 --> 04:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
have a diagnostic mamogram every six
 
04:53:19.788 --> 04:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
months and that's the one that's 600
 
04:53:22.350 --> 04:53:22.360 align:start position:0%
bucks so and that's just how it's done
 
04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
right well you get you still get a free
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
one every year not not after oh once
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
you've actually
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
been that's interesting no you're not
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
considered um this is a medical term but
 
04:53:36.270 --> 04:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
not really medical we call you
 
04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
walkie-talkie so you're walkie-talkie
 
04:53:40.830 --> 04:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
off the street normal no problems you
 
04:53:42.470 --> 04:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
get a screening mamogram if you have a
 
04:53:44.270 --> 04:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
single problem we say no you're a
 
04:53:46.628 --> 04:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
diagnostic mamogram and the diagnostic
 
04:53:49.310 --> 04:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
mamogram is just more tailored exam of
 
04:53:51.948 --> 04:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
each breast and so it's read Real Time
 
04:53:54.788 --> 04:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
by someone like myself who's able to say
 
04:53:56.670 --> 04:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure about this spot can
 
04:53:58.270 --> 04:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
you go back in and do some extra
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
pictures and we're going to need an
 
04:54:01.270 --> 04:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
ultrasound it's really a work in
 
04:54:03.708 --> 04:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
progress exam so that's why I diagnos
 
04:54:05.868 --> 04:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
mamams are more
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
expensive yeah and and that's true I I
 
04:54:12.788 --> 04:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
would imagine um I mean it goes from
 
04:54:15.470 --> 04:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
like up to five years women will be in
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
the diagnostic
 
04:54:21.390 --> 04:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
pool so um I think that was something
 
04:54:24.590 --> 04:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned about
 
04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
um it was representative spear who was
 
04:54:29.230 --> 04:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the prevalence of breast
 
04:54:31.430 --> 04:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
cancer in our state which is absolutely
 
04:54:33.708 --> 04:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
true I've had to do statistics on this
 
04:54:36.390 --> 04:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
before um we're routinely in the top
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
five I think the most recent Year we're
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
number four out of 50 states whatever it
 
04:54:43.830 --> 04:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
is here we have a lot of breast cancer
 
04:54:45.750 --> 04:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
across the United States it's one in
 
04:54:48.190 --> 04:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
eight women um I'm sorry one in eight
 
04:54:49.830 --> 04:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
women yeah will be diagnosed with
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
invasive breast cancer that's the kind
 
04:54:54.350 --> 04:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
that can metastasize to lungs liver
 
04:54:57.548 --> 04:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
brain bones um but here in New Hampshire
 
04:54:59.590 --> 04:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit higher unfortunately
 
04:55:01.788 --> 04:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
so we see a lot of it and also is one of
 
04:55:04.670 --> 04:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
the few cancers where we screen manually
 
04:55:05.830 --> 04:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
so you could be like I said
 
04:55:08.070 --> 04:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
walkie-talkie off the street totally
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
normal every year but maybe you have a
 
04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
lot of benign breast disease you know
 
04:55:15.350 --> 04:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
masses are constantly forming in your
 
04:55:17.868 --> 04:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
breasts that are benign not cancer but
 
04:55:19.628 --> 04:55:19.638 align:start position:0%
we don't know until we take a look at
 
04:55:22.628 --> 04:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
them further so that's why you know if a
 
04:55:24.788 --> 04:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
th000 mammograms are done today 100
 
04:55:26.270 --> 04:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
women will be called back not all of
 
04:55:29.310 --> 04:55:29.320 align:start position:0%
it's cancer maybe only 10 of those are
 
04:55:33.510 --> 04:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
cancer um I think that was it on the oh
 
04:55:36.310 --> 04:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
and I did there was a question um that
 
04:55:38.910 --> 04:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
came up about the fiscal note and I
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
remember uh there was an email about the
 
04:55:44.430 --> 04:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
um the insurance department did get a
 
04:55:47.230 --> 04:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
copy of this and they did not oppose
 
04:55:50.030 --> 04:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um they said it wouldn't defil
 
04:55:51.430 --> 04:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
if I'm getting that word right they
 
04:55:53.470 --> 04:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't defil the costs because there
 
04:55:55.310 --> 04:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
are no new Services being
 
04:55:59.070 --> 04:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
added if that makes sense um it's just
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
expansion right so existing Services
 
04:56:03.788 --> 04:56:03.798 align:start position:0%
that's an issue related to Affordable
 
04:56:05.670 --> 04:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
Care Act that if we were to create a
 
04:56:08.948 --> 04:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
whole if this wasn't already being
 
04:56:12.150 --> 04:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
done then uh the state would have to pay
 
04:56:14.670 --> 04:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
for the Mandate okay uh but that in
 
04:56:17.030 --> 04:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
terms of what the insurance department
 
04:56:19.110 --> 04:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
they don't take positions on
 
04:56:22.190 --> 04:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
mandates regardless so but that they
 
04:56:24.990 --> 04:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
would say to us that we if in terms of
 
04:56:27.510 --> 04:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
doing it we have a a statute to do a
 
04:56:31.150 --> 04:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
cost analysis on the Mandate okay on the
 
04:56:32.948 --> 04:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
bill so right because these are services
 
04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
that we been doing for decades this is
 
04:56:37.110 --> 04:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
this is not anything that's that would
 
04:56:39.750 --> 04:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
be new or experimental right exactly um
 
04:56:40.948 --> 04:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
and I did want to mention there was
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
something to that came up about non-
 
04:56:45.670 --> 04:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
preventative care um this is something
 
04:56:47.830 --> 04:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
that I talked to my patients a lot about
 
04:56:50.750 --> 04:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
more recently because of some federal
 
04:56:53.470 --> 04:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
legislation um we've been talking more
 
04:56:56.470 --> 04:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
about dense breasts and how mammograms
 
04:56:58.230 --> 04:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
are not very Sensi screening mammograms
 
04:57:00.150 --> 04:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
are not very sensitive in dense breast
 
04:57:03.868 --> 04:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
tissue if mammograms are maybe 80 %
 
04:57:06.510 --> 04:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
sensitive in all Commerce it could go
 
04:57:08.830 --> 04:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
down to 60% in women with extremely
 
04:57:11.750 --> 04:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
dense breasts so what we recommend is an
 
04:57:14.788 --> 04:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
ultrasound if you're of average risk and
 
04:57:17.470 --> 04:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
that would be annually um just to make
 
04:57:19.788 --> 04:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
sure you know that that finds maybe
 
04:57:22.350 --> 04:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
three additional cancers per thousand
 
04:57:24.948 --> 04:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
and um for women who are at higher risk
 
04:57:24.958 --> 04:57:26.990 align:start position:0%
and um for women who are at higher risk
annual

04:57:26.990 --> 04:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
annual
 
04:57:29.310 --> 04:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
MRI whether they're dense or not but if
 
04:57:31.110 --> 04:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
you have enough of a family history and
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
this is all truly what a physician like
 
04:57:35.430 --> 04:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
myself would consider preventative care
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
because what we're trying to present
 
04:57:39.070 --> 04:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
prevent is metastatic breast cancer
 
04:57:40.910 --> 04:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
because there's no cure for that you
 
04:57:42.750 --> 04:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
know we can cut out little cancers and
 
04:57:45.310 --> 04:57:45.320 align:start position:0%
we can irradiate them and it's cheap to
 
04:57:48.470 --> 04:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
do so I mean relatively cheap what's
 
04:57:51.230 --> 04:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
really expensive as when you take a
 
04:57:53.750 --> 04:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
working woman off the streets and you
 
04:57:55.788 --> 04:57:55.798 align:start position:0%
know sideline her so that she can't work
 
04:57:58.350 --> 04:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
anymore she can't provide child care
 
04:57:58.360 --> 04:58:01.390 align:start position:0%
anymore she can't provide child care
elder

04:58:01.390 --> 04:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:05.270 --> 04:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
care so just um maybe it's l so but an
 
04:58:06.990 --> 04:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is going to be cheaper than
 
04:58:07.000 --> 04:58:07.708 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is going to be cheaper than
an

04:58:07.708 --> 04:58:07.718 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:58:10.628 --> 04:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
MRI Lots that's what I yes I would think
 
04:58:15.750 --> 04:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
so uh maybe 250 $250 old technology
 
04:58:19.830 --> 04:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
versus new exactly yeah yeah okay um I
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
thought I would give a couple of
 
04:58:26.030 --> 04:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
examples 10 days ago I received a call
 
04:58:28.230 --> 04:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
at my office in the morning I think it
 
04:58:29.628 --> 04:58:29.638 align:start position:0%
was that day that was really snowy
 
04:58:32.470 --> 04:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
whatever that day was and it was a woman
 
04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
who lived out of State she was calling
 
04:58:36.590 --> 04:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
about her mom who uh she had just found
 
04:58:38.190 --> 04:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
out that her mom had a breast
 
04:58:41.470 --> 04:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
MK and so she said how can I get her in
 
04:58:42.948 --> 04:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
she doesn't have a doctor she doesn't go
 
04:58:45.830 --> 04:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
to the doctor routinely and I asked if
 
04:58:47.590 --> 04:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
she did have insurance and she said yes
 
04:58:50.270 --> 04:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
she has you know something so she works
 
04:58:50.280 --> 04:58:50.990 align:start position:0%
she has you know something so she works
in

04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:58:53.590 --> 04:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and um so we finally got
 
04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
this woman in she went to Urgent Care
 
04:58:58.390 --> 04:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
and I got a call from the Urgent Care PA
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
never a good sign and said it's you're
 
04:59:02.390 --> 04:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
going to need to biopsy this so I'm
 
04:59:04.830 --> 04:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
sending over orders right now as well
 
04:59:07.670 --> 04:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
and the woman had a breast mask that um
 
04:59:09.910 --> 04:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
it was as hard as this table and my
 
04:59:12.910 --> 04:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
staff who's like they're highly trained
 
04:59:14.430 --> 04:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
highly experienced they said I don't
 
04:59:16.510 --> 04:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
know how you're going to biopsy that
 
04:59:19.590 --> 04:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
because it was so hard so I did and it
 
04:59:21.628 --> 04:59:21.638 align:start position:0%
was a struggle and I biopsy the lymph
 
04:59:24.230 --> 04:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
nodes under her arm and unfortunately I
 
04:59:26.390 --> 04:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
also biopsy lymph nodes under the other
 
04:59:28.350 --> 04:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
arm because the cancer had become so
 
04:59:30.270 --> 04:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
widespread that it moved clear on over
 
04:59:33.150 --> 04:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
to the other side so that's a kind kind
 
04:59:34.548 --> 04:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
of thing that we're trying to prevent
 
04:59:35.990 --> 04:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
and I've seen this so many times and
 
04:59:38.548 --> 04:59:38.558 align:start position:0%
it's so frustrating and it I remember
 
04:59:40.430 --> 04:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
the first time that I had a conversation
 
04:59:42.150 --> 04:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
with a patient about insurance and what
 
04:59:45.788 --> 04:59:45.798 align:start position:0%
exams would cost and it was oh gosh I
 
04:59:47.830 --> 04:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
was so awkward about it I was probably
 
04:59:49.708 --> 04:59:49.718 align:start position:0%
practicing for three or four years it
 
04:59:52.510 --> 04:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
was like you know
 
04:59:56.430 --> 04:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
2012 and um I just tripped all over
 
04:59:59.270 --> 04:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
myself but I do it all the time now so
 
05:00:01.070 --> 05:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
I'm really good about it they're always
 
05:00:03.270 --> 05:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
asking what's it going to cost how much
 
05:00:05.350 --> 05:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
is a biopsy versus like what if I come
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
back in six months and you just ult down
 
05:00:09.990 --> 05:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
this again like making these decisions
 
05:00:12.270 --> 05:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
just rationalizing stuff all the time
 
05:00:14.708 --> 05:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
they don't come back for follow-up care
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
that we recommend because they're
 
05:00:16.990 --> 05:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
worried about the cost they get the
 
05:00:19.110 --> 05:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
first bill and then they don't want to
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
come back so they stretch it out for 12
 
05:00:22.430 --> 05:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
months and then they're just worried the
 
05:00:23.948 --> 05:00:23.958 align:start position:0%
whole time and you see that sigh of
 
05:00:25.470 --> 05:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
relief when you come back in they're
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
like oh it's the same oh thank goodness
 
05:00:30.628 --> 05:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
it's just kind of crazy it's not what I
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
expected when I went to
 
05:00:37.190 --> 05:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:41.830 --> 05:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:44.350 --> 05:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
bam I've experienced
 
05:00:49.110 --> 05:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
many um uh I had to go into the to be
 
05:00:51.230 --> 05:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
diagnosed several times every time I
 
05:00:54.110 --> 05:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
would go in and uh it hasn't happened
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
since I am on Social Security now so I
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if that makes a difference or
 
05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
another or are the machines better than
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
they were 20 years ago because I always
 
05:01:07.788 --> 05:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
had to be called back and now I don't my
 
05:01:09.110 --> 05:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
mother died of breast cancer when she
 
05:01:11.430 --> 05:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
was 60
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
so is there like a different hospitals
 
05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
have different machines or are all the
 
05:01:19.390 --> 05:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
machines the same can I trust the person
 
05:01:24.670 --> 05:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
that does you know the um Diagnostics um
 
05:01:28.350 --> 05:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
can I trust her so the machines are all
 
05:01:29.830 --> 05:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
pretty similar these days but there was
 
05:01:31.470 --> 05:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
a Great Leap Forward with Tomas
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
synthesis back in 20
 
05:01:39.390 --> 05:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
3 um I would say that as a woman ages
 
05:01:42.548 --> 05:01:42.558 align:start position:0%
cancer becomes more uh more common you
 
05:01:45.190 --> 05:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
know our our sort of annual risk for
 
05:01:48.150 --> 05:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
cancer increases but it's a lot easier
 
05:01:51.270 --> 05:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
to diagnose it in an older woman um the
 
05:01:52.750 --> 05:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
breast sort of quiet down there are a
 
05:01:54.628 --> 05:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
bunch of things that happen in breast
 
05:01:57.390 --> 05:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
tissue in younger women that tend not to
 
05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
happen in older women and so you have
 
05:02:03.430 --> 05:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
less confounding stuff going on We There
 
05:02:04.990 --> 05:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
are some women who get called back every
 
05:02:06.868 --> 05:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
year because they have cysts or they
 
05:02:08.190 --> 05:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
have other you know calcifications
 
05:02:10.070 --> 05:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
forming and things like that and we
 
05:02:12.230 --> 05:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
can't tell just based off of a screening
 
05:02:14.150 --> 05:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
mammogram because it truly is only the
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
beginning we cannot tell what it is we
 
05:02:18.910 --> 05:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
have to get you back in it's it's always
 
05:02:21.470 --> 05:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
just multiple steps in the
 
05:02:24.470 --> 05:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
process all right
 
05:02:27.868 --> 05:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
thanks okay thank you very much oh
 
05:02:30.590 --> 05:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
represent Terry so it's it's generally
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
recognized that uh women are far more
 
05:02:34.670 --> 05:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
conscientious about taking care of
 
05:02:37.230 --> 05:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
themselves than men and are far less in
 
05:02:39.270 --> 05:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
denial about needing to do things to
 
05:02:41.350 --> 05:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
take care of themselves so I just wanted
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
to be uh sure about
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
that uh really really D treading on and
 
05:02:50.910 --> 05:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
that is and that is that you when you're
 
05:02:52.548 --> 05:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
saying that there are women who are
 
05:02:54.510 --> 05:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the cost in terms of
 
05:02:57.310 --> 05:02:57.320 align:start position:0%
coming back for additional Imaging that
 
05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
that that that's the vast majority if
 
05:03:02.310 --> 05:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
not all of the cases uh because I'm
 
05:03:04.110 --> 05:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
sitting is a man saying well you know if
 
05:03:05.990 --> 05:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
it was a man he would he would just deny
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
it and it wouldn't be anything to do
 
05:03:10.590 --> 05:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
with money so is it's it's it's pretty
 
05:03:13.788 --> 05:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
much the money right it's a a financial
 
05:03:16.270 --> 05:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
hardship there are a lot of barriers to
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
healthc care I mean you try scheduling
 
05:03:19.230 --> 05:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
your mammogram right now it's going to
 
05:03:21.390 --> 05:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
be three months right like it's really
 
05:03:23.470 --> 05:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
hard to get a hold of anybody on the
 
05:03:25.270 --> 05:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
phone there are a lot of barriers but I
 
05:03:28.548 --> 05:03:28.558 align:start position:0%
will disagree with you politely and say
 
05:03:30.590 --> 05:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
that um the things that I hear in my
 
05:03:33.670 --> 05:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
exam rooms are it's hard to get time off
 
05:03:35.788 --> 05:03:35.798 align:start position:0%
work to come in for testing it's hard to
 
05:03:39.548 --> 05:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
get child care um when I give a woman a
 
05:03:42.510 --> 05:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of breast cancer within the
 
05:03:44.830 --> 05:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
first five minutes they're talking about
 
05:03:47.830 --> 05:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
who's going to take care of EX you know
 
05:03:49.350 --> 05:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
they're worried about their husbands if
 
05:03:51.030 --> 05:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
they're older they're worried about
 
05:03:53.430 --> 05:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
their kids if they're younger I see a
 
05:03:55.470 --> 05:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
lot of women who put off things you know
 
05:03:57.788 --> 05:03:57.798 align:start position:0%
there's like this whole uh wellness and
 
05:04:01.628 --> 05:04:01.638 align:start position:0%
self-care culture sure um you can ask
 
05:04:03.830 --> 05:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
any physician we like the last ones to
 
05:04:05.830 --> 05:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
participate in Wellness or self-care cuz
 
05:04:08.910 --> 05:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
we're like go go go but um a lot of
 
05:04:10.910 --> 05:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
women are that way they a lot of women
 
05:04:13.590 --> 05:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
will put things off just because they
 
05:04:16.110 --> 05:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
feel that they don't have time and
 
05:04:18.030 --> 05:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
they're worried about
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
costs so I do I just truly have so many
 
05:04:24.788 --> 05:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
questions about uh cost now that I have
 
05:04:27.430 --> 05:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
a printed out copy of our self-pay uh
 
05:04:31.430 --> 05:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
self-pay costs like $800 for a biopsy
 
05:04:33.150 --> 05:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
you know like I can quote some of them
 
05:04:34.470 --> 05:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head because I get
 
05:04:38.230 --> 05:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
asked so often rck
 
05:04:41.070 --> 05:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
fall thank you yes so thank you for
 
05:04:43.830 --> 05:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
clarifying that that it's not denial
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's all sorts of
 
05:04:48.310 --> 05:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
concerns that that that women have and
 
05:04:51.150 --> 05:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
it it includes Financial but it's it's a
 
05:04:52.628 --> 05:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
number of other concerns like who's
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
going to take care of my children yada a
 
05:04:58.070 --> 05:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of concerns y okay thank you
 
05:05:00.990 --> 05:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you're
 
05:05:05.868 --> 05:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:09.750 --> 05:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
much okay uh chair we'll call on Peter
 
05:05:12.070 --> 05:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
bragon for Harvard
 
05:05:17.310 --> 05:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:20.070 --> 05:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you Mr chairman committee
 
05:05:22.390 --> 05:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
members again Peter Bron uh representing
 
05:05:23.830 --> 05:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare the state's
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
only KN for profit health insurance
 
05:05:27.070 --> 05:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
carrier for the individual and group
 
05:05:29.788 --> 05:05:29.798 align:start position:0%
markets and uh I specifically indicated
 
05:05:31.430 --> 05:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
on this as well as the prior bill that
 
05:05:33.628 --> 05:05:33.638 align:start position:0%
we are not taking a position for or
 
05:05:35.830 --> 05:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
against but wanted to just raise some
 
05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
issues around it for your consideration
 
05:05:39.030 --> 05:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
and having been a former legislator I
 
05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
can appreciate the position where uh
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily black and white
 
05:05:45.030 --> 05:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's it's a balancing act that that
 
05:05:46.470 --> 05:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
has to occur and so I just like to
 
05:05:48.788 --> 05:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
address a few things on that uh first of
 
05:05:51.070 --> 05:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
all uh the prior Bill we had today uh
 
05:05:53.390 --> 05:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
had major concerns with regarding the
 
05:05:54.868 --> 05:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
fact that it took out the medical
 
05:05:57.670 --> 05:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
necessity and had no cost sharing I will
 
05:05:59.868 --> 05:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
point out that this bill appears to me
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
that uh on lines 18 and
 
05:06:06.470 --> 05:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
24 uh does include the term medically
 
05:06:08.670 --> 05:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
necessary so it doesn't have the same
 
05:06:11.430 --> 05:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
issues that uh this morning's Bill had
 
05:06:14.230 --> 05:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh and so the the issue then revolves
 
05:06:17.310 --> 05:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
around the the no cost sharing provision
 
05:06:19.628 --> 05:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
therein um and as I mentioned earlier
 
05:06:21.390 --> 05:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
there are several bills uh coming down
 
05:06:22.788 --> 05:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
the pike this year and there are several
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
every year that try to eliminate cost
 
05:06:27.310 --> 05:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
sharing and that's where that balancing
 
05:06:30.190 --> 05:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
test comes in um and one final note
 
05:06:32.190 --> 05:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
before I mention the cost sharing U my
 
05:06:33.510 --> 05:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
understanding understanding is that the
 
05:06:36.430 --> 05:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
state of Maine has legislation that it
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
has enacted legislation that is very
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
similar to this um to my understanding
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
the state of Massachusetts had not they
 
05:06:45.990 --> 05:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
had legislation before them which
 
05:06:48.628 --> 05:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
generated I think the cost study that uh
 
05:06:50.510 --> 05:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
you have seen we have not seen that but
 
05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's what's being referred to
 
05:06:54.430 --> 05:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
and they sent it off to study so just
 
05:06:55.910 --> 05:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
that that's my knowledge of it as we
 
05:06:58.470 --> 05:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
were here I was texting uh my contact at
 
05:06:59.948 --> 05:06:59.958 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim to say what's going on
 
05:07:01.150 --> 05:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
in these other states so that's
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
currently my understanding if that
 
05:07:05.510 --> 05:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
changes I'll let you know um but the
 
05:07:06.750 --> 05:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
whole issue of the cost sharing it's a
 
05:07:08.470 --> 05:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
balancing act right because costs will
 
05:07:10.350 --> 05:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
get shifted whether they're small cost
 
05:07:13.070 --> 05:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
or larger cost it's a range of them and
 
05:07:16.510 --> 05:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
so um what's going to happen is if you C
 
05:07:18.830 --> 05:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
if if you make it so any specific
 
05:07:20.628 --> 05:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
disease or condition does not have cost
 
05:07:23.788 --> 05:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
sharing that means others who have other
 
05:07:25.948 --> 05:07:25.958 align:start position:0%
diseases are going to have to that the
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
cost is going to get shifted to them and
 
05:07:30.270 --> 05:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
then some of those people may foro their
 
05:07:33.310 --> 05:07:33.320 align:start position:0%
treatment or a company who is providing
 
05:07:36.750 --> 05:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
insurance for their employees may see
 
05:07:39.708 --> 05:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
the cost increase for the plan they have
 
05:07:41.830 --> 05:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
and decide okay I'm going to shift to a
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
plan with a higher deductible at which
 
05:07:46.230 --> 05:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
point their employees are faced with
 
05:07:48.590 --> 05:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
this decision of should I get care or
 
05:07:49.830 --> 05:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't I right it's a factor that
 
05:07:51.750 --> 05:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
everybody comes into and some companies
 
05:07:53.150 --> 05:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
may decide I'm not going to provide
 
05:07:54.670 --> 05:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
insurance for my employees at all at
 
05:07:56.990 --> 05:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
which point they have to get their own
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
some of them will choose not to get it
 
05:08:00.830 --> 05:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh and some will get high deductible
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
plans and some will be forced to make
 
05:08:04.708 --> 05:08:04.718 align:start position:0%
that decision so in any of these things
 
05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's the breast cancer screening
 
05:08:07.270 --> 05:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
or the glucose
 
05:08:09.430 --> 05:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring some group will have an
 
05:08:12.030 --> 05:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
easier time but it's a balancing act
 
05:08:13.750 --> 05:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
because there's going to be other people
 
05:08:16.470 --> 05:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
who may either not have insurance at all
 
05:08:18.430 --> 05:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
or be faced with decisions on other
 
05:08:21.510 --> 05:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
diseases uh chronic or acute that uh
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
they have to make that same decision so
 
05:08:26.708 --> 05:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
it's a balancing act on a policy uh set
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
and so uh we're not taking a position on
 
05:08:30.628 --> 05:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
the policy itself but just the big
 
05:08:32.948 --> 05:08:32.958 align:start position:0%
picture idea that cost sharing
 
05:08:35.590 --> 05:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
eliminating cost sharing by itself it's
 
05:08:37.390 --> 05:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
not an isolated incident it affects
 
05:08:39.270 --> 05:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
other parts of the system and again
 
05:08:41.590 --> 05:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
we're not not for-profit uh insurance
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
company we're not looking to protect
 
05:08:45.070 --> 05:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
shareholders but we do want to make sure
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
that people as many people as possible
 
05:08:48.628 --> 05:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
can have insurance and you're in a
 
05:08:51.270 --> 05:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
difficult position happy to answer any
 
05:08:54.030 --> 05:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
05:08:57.548 --> 05:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
carry good enough good enough anything
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:01.120 --> 05:09:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
dinner

05:09:05.910 --> 05:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
I don't want to be left with the
 
05:09:12.390 --> 05:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
impression that we're talking about an
 
05:09:16.110 --> 05:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
increase in uh premiums of hundreds of
 
05:09:18.990 --> 05:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
dollars the analysis which I have a copy
 
05:09:21.670 --> 05:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
of and I I guess you may have we're
 
05:09:26.270 --> 05:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
talking about 13 to 33
 
05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
cents let's put it in the right ballpark
 
05:09:30.350 --> 05:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
if we're going to say well we're going
 
05:09:31.948 --> 05:09:31.958 align:start position:0%
to push up premiums we're going to do
 
05:09:34.708 --> 05:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
this is we're talking about pennies and
 
05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about one of the highest
 
05:09:39.670 --> 05:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
cancer rates in the country affecting so
 
05:09:43.150 --> 05:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
many people so I think when you give
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
these kinds of statements I think you
 
05:09:47.190 --> 05:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
got to put them in proportion thank you
 
05:09:49.110 --> 05:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
for the question and I I didn't mean to
 
05:09:50.750 --> 05:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh imply that it's a range of things
 
05:09:52.350 --> 05:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
this one as compared to the glucose
 
05:09:54.110 --> 05:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring earlier the day this is very
 
05:09:56.830 --> 05:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
small uh the invitro fertilization which
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
was $10 to $100 per member per month
 
05:10:00.830 --> 05:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's on way on the other scale
 
05:10:02.830 --> 05:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
so but it's still a balance act and yes
 
05:10:04.948 --> 05:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
it's going to be now I don't know what
 
05:10:06.788 --> 05:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts law said I don't know
 
05:10:08.110 --> 05:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
who did the study I don't know what
 
05:10:10.190 --> 05:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
assumptions were made but even let's
 
05:10:12.628 --> 05:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
assume it's you know 33 cents per month
 
05:10:15.390 --> 05:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
so it's uh uh four bucks basically per
 
05:10:17.430 --> 05:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
employee per year you got 100 employees
 
05:10:18.990 --> 05:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
so your insurance premium is going to go
 
05:10:21.190 --> 05:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
up $400 in addition to what it's already
 
05:10:23.670 --> 05:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
going up right and so a company may look
 
05:10:25.548 --> 05:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
at that and say I can absorb that a
 
05:10:27.750 --> 05:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
company may look at it and say okay
 
05:10:29.868 --> 05:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
given all the other increases uh in our
 
05:10:31.510 --> 05:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
profits this year I'm going to raise the
 
05:10:34.350 --> 05:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
deductible so I I do think this on on
 
05:10:36.030 --> 05:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
the it's on the small scale of things
 
05:10:38.350 --> 05:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
being looked at but the same Balancing
 
05:10:41.510 --> 05:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
Act applies things things are not
 
05:10:43.470 --> 05:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
static right thank you very much thank
 
05:10:46.190 --> 05:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
05:10:51.230 --> 05:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh Carrie Becker had a question oh who
 
05:10:57.030 --> 05:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.430 --> 05:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
sorry do we know the compar comparison
 
05:11:05.350 --> 05:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
from men to women um are there um cancer
 
05:11:08.590 --> 05:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
rates much different that is not thank
 
05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
you for the question that is not
 
05:11:11.030 --> 05:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
something I I would know about perhaps
 
05:11:12.670 --> 05:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
there's people uh who will speak on this
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
that know more about that than I do uh
 
05:11:16.030 --> 05:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll repeat by the way what I saw on
 
05:11:17.910 --> 05:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
the other way that notice that the state
 
05:11:19.430 --> 05:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
employees are not included town and
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
School Employees so it's again passing a
 
05:11:22.628 --> 05:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
bill that applies to other people but
 
05:11:24.868 --> 05:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
not to the government only to 20% of the
 
05:11:26.590 --> 05:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
population thank
 
05:11:29.990 --> 05:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
you okay Carrie
 
05:11:32.708 --> 05:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
Baker back
 
05:11:35.990 --> 05:11:36.000 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to stray a little bit from
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
this I'm asking you to support how
 
05:12:01.920 --> 05:12:03.270 align:start position:0%
this I'm asking you to support how
Hospital

05:12:03.270 --> 05:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
05:12:06.670 --> 05:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
1296 I was diagnosed at the age of 46
 
05:12:10.910 --> 05:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
back in 2021 February with invasive
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
decal cancer breast cancer but I caught
 
05:12:17.590 --> 05:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
it early the diagnostic piece is great
 
05:12:20.030 --> 05:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
you you know ACA gives us the
 
05:12:22.510 --> 05:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get a mammogram and the
 
05:12:25.590 --> 05:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
costs are nothing to us but after I had
 
05:12:28.948 --> 05:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
that mamogram I had three ultrasounds
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
two biopsies one MRI and
 
05:12:34.948 --> 05:12:34.958 align:start position:0%
three additional mammograms I had to pay
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
for that out of
 
05:12:39.150 --> 05:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
pocket okay so you want to talk about
 
05:12:41.628 --> 05:12:41.638 align:start position:0%
cost sharing I'm very fortunate I able
 
05:12:44.670 --> 05:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
to afford that I'm the mom of two boys
 
05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
my husband owns a business in New
 
05:12:46.160 --> 05:12:47.990 align:start position:0%
my husband owns a business in New
Hampshire

05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
and there have been two three four women
 
05:12:54.628 --> 05:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
diagnosed in the past three years at his
 
05:12:56.750 --> 05:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
company here in New Hampshire with
 
05:12:56.760 --> 05:12:57.590 align:start position:0%
company here in New Hampshire with
breast

05:12:57.590 --> 05:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
breast
 
05:13:00.750 --> 05:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
cancer one of which who has
 
05:13:00.760 --> 05:13:03.070 align:start position:0%
cancer one of which who has
died

05:13:03.070 --> 05:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
died
 
05:13:05.868 --> 05:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
this is it's it is detectable I caught
 
05:13:08.948 --> 05:13:08.958 align:start position:0%
it early enough I'm St I was stage two
 
05:13:11.230 --> 05:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
and I will be in a
 
05:13:15.310 --> 05:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
diagnostic bucket for five to 10 years
 
05:13:17.070 --> 05:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
so until I'm almost
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
60 so think about it I mean that's that
 
05:13:22.670 --> 05:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
means that now my mammograms are no
 
05:13:26.030 --> 05:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
longer coded as preventative it is cated
 
05:13:26.040 --> 05:13:27.910 align:start position:0%
longer coded as preventative it is cated
as

05:13:27.910 --> 05:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:13:30.628 --> 05:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
diagnostic so being diagnostic that
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
means that I might have to go do another
 
05:13:32.400 --> 05:13:33.670 align:start position:0%
means that I might have to go do another
breast

05:13:33.670 --> 05:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
breast
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
MRI it means that I actually I I pay
 
05:13:39.150 --> 05:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
more just to make sure that I'm living
 
05:13:41.470 --> 05:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
the life as they call it the Ned life no
 
05:13:43.708 --> 05:13:43.718 align:start position:0%
evidence of
 
05:13:47.510 --> 05:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
disease um I know another woman who and
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
and forgive me I might end up in tears
 
05:13:52.030 --> 05:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
another woman decided instead of going
 
05:13:55.190 --> 05:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
back after having an abnormal
 
05:13:57.230 --> 05:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
mamogram and going and doing more
 
05:13:58.990 --> 05:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
diagnostic testing she decided to pay
 
05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
for her child's education college
 
05:14:04.750 --> 05:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
died women will do things for their
 
05:14:11.230 --> 05:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
family and for other people we are
 
05:14:13.310 --> 05:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
caregivers instead of taking care of
 
05:14:15.910 --> 05:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves oh it just hurts it'll be okay
 
05:14:18.110 --> 05:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
I'll figure it out oh I went I go
 
05:14:20.270 --> 05:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
annually it's not a big
 
05:14:22.990 --> 05:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
deal all I'm asking is from some
 
05:14:25.150 --> 05:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
recognition that hey you know what I am
 
05:14:28.110 --> 05:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
living right now with no evidence of
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
disease but I shouldn't be
 
05:14:33.430 --> 05:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
penalized and have to pay more to make
 
05:14:36.548 --> 05:14:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
way that's that's what I'm asking for
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that we should have
 
05:14:43.708 --> 05:14:43.718 align:start position:0%
preferential treatment I'm saying I want
 
05:14:45.948 --> 05:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
to live for my
 
05:14:48.430 --> 05:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
boys I want to be
 
05:14:51.510 --> 05:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
around I am lucky I am very fortunate to
 
05:14:54.470 --> 05:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
be able to afford the out of pocket
 
05:14:56.150 --> 05:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
costs but think about the people who
 
05:14:58.350 --> 05:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
don't I have friends who still haven't
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
gotten mammograms and they're
 
05:15:00.600 --> 05:15:02.590 align:start position:0%
gotten mammograms and they're
50

05:15:02.590 --> 05:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
50
 
05:15:03.510 --> 05:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
they know
 
05:15:06.628 --> 05:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
me we caught it early it was my fourth
 
05:15:09.350 --> 05:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
annual mammogram that they found
 
05:15:09.360 --> 05:15:14.510 align:start position:0%
annual mammogram that they found
it

05:15:14.510 --> 05:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:17.150 --> 05:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
um it's an emotional
 
05:15:21.350 --> 05:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
toll it is scary and every year that I
 
05:15:22.788 --> 05:15:22.798 align:start position:0%
go have my screening which I will have
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
in February it's scary it's a lot yes
 
05:15:29.470 --> 05:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much it is it's
 
05:15:32.708 --> 05:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
scary it's it I walk in going going are
 
05:15:34.708 --> 05:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
they going to find something because
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
when you say one and eight it's one and
 
05:15:40.548 --> 05:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
eight in each breast it doesn't
 
05:15:44.628 --> 05:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
jump I had a mastectomy I had radiation
 
05:15:47.230 --> 05:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
I am in chemical menopause so I have to
 
05:15:49.910 --> 05:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
take medicine all the
 
05:15:52.670 --> 05:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
time it's not I wouldn't wish this on my
 
05:15:52.680 --> 05:15:55.390 align:start position:0%
time it's not I wouldn't wish this on my
worst

05:15:55.390 --> 05:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:59.910 --> 05:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
enemy but diagnostic testing saved saved
 
05:16:02.670 --> 05:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
my life the tumor they grew within a
 
05:16:07.190 --> 05:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
year grew they were three
 
05:16:12.070 --> 05:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
cmers from zero to 3 centimeters I had
 
05:16:15.590 --> 05:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
multiple places and
 
05:16:19.230 --> 05:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
um it was invasive ductal carcinoma
 
05:16:22.430 --> 05:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
which is the scary piece but I'm I am
 
05:16:24.750 --> 05:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
living the Ned life and that's I'm just
 
05:16:26.628 --> 05:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
asking for your support because
 
05:16:29.190 --> 05:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
diagnostic I understand there is a
 
05:16:31.110 --> 05:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
profit piece to healthcare and things
 
05:16:34.750 --> 05:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
like that and insurance and somebody has
 
05:16:37.470 --> 05:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
to take the costs but if you have people
 
05:16:39.150 --> 05:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
who are diagnosed with breast cancer
 
05:16:40.948 --> 05:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
working being a part and being
 
05:16:43.670 --> 05:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
productive in society and giving back
 
05:16:45.868 --> 05:16:45.878 align:start position:0%
and and and and increasing the economy
 
05:16:48.230 --> 05:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
by purchasing and doing things then
 
05:16:51.070 --> 05:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
isn't that a win for
 
05:16:55.350 --> 05:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:58.590 --> 05:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
for I can I can talk I I don't have
 
05:17:00.868 --> 05:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
numbers I know that because of the
 
05:17:04.430 --> 05:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosis for a lot of the spouses uh my
 
05:17:06.390 --> 05:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
husband's company which is based out of
 
05:17:10.990 --> 05:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
Bedford New Hampshire employs 160
 
05:17:15.070 --> 05:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
people their insurance premiums went up
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
300% because of it yet they swallow the
 
05:17:21.628 --> 05:17:21.638 align:start position:0%
cost the company does they don't pass it
 
05:17:22.910 --> 05:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
on to the employees because they care
 
05:17:24.350 --> 05:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
about the employees because they want
 
05:17:27.788 --> 05:17:27.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:31.510 --> 05:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
work it's I don't know I'm just asking

about it think about who's impacted one

Bill

1296 and I am not going to uh do much
 
05:18:57.948 --> 05:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
with my testimony now because I don't
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
think I need to I think you definitely
 
05:19:02.190 --> 05:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
understand the difference
 
05:19:03.670 --> 05:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
between a
 
05:19:07.590 --> 05:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
screening M mamogram at this point and
 
05:19:13.750 --> 05:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
why uh some women um and Men um may need
 
05:19:15.990 --> 05:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
to go for a follow-up
 
05:19:19.110 --> 05:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
exam uh just this morning the American
 
05:19:22.948 --> 05:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
Cancer Society released its annual uh
 
05:19:25.470 --> 05:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
cancer facts and Figures it's very
 
05:19:28.150 --> 05:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
timely that it was released just
 
05:19:32.670 --> 05:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
today and um we have new
 
05:19:35.830 --> 05:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
numbers uh estimated numbers of how many
 
05:19:37.830 --> 05:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
people will be diagnosed with cancer in
 
05:19:39.910 --> 05:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
05:19:42.270 --> 05:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the new grand total
 
05:19:45.070 --> 05:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
approximately will be
 
05:19:48.990 --> 05:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
9,880 people that number has gone up
 
05:19:53.788 --> 05:19:53.798 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for breast cancer it is
 
05:19:56.310 --> 05:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
1,460 women will approximately be
 
05:19:59.470 --> 05:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
diagnosed in the year 2024 with breast
 
05:20:01.948 --> 05:20:01.958 align:start position:0%
cancer now men can also be diagnosed
 
05:20:05.030 --> 05:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
with breast cancer uh the Cancer Society
 
05:20:09.910 --> 05:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
does not track uh that number uh by
 
05:20:15.190 --> 05:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
state it is uh not a a a number that's
 
05:20:17.590 --> 05:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
large enough to be tracked in men but it
 
05:20:22.030 --> 05:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
is it is it does happen for men um of
 
05:20:22.040 --> 05:20:22.788 align:start position:0%
is it is it does happen for men um of
that

05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:26.230 --> 05:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
1,460 women approximately 180 of them
 
05:20:27.590 --> 05:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
will lose their
 
05:20:29.868 --> 05:20:29.878 align:start position:0%
life to breast cancer in the state of
 
05:20:33.070 --> 05:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in 200 24 it's rather
 
05:20:35.190 --> 05:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
sobering number 180 women will lose
 
05:20:37.390 --> 05:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
their life to breast cancer in the state
 
05:20:40.948 --> 05:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:44.390 --> 05:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cost sharing can be a barrier
 
05:20:46.708 --> 05:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
to people getting follow-up
 
05:20:49.628 --> 05:20:49.638 align:start position:0%
care and I think you just heard rather
 
05:20:52.350 --> 05:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
emotional testimony an important
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
testimony as to why it was
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
important for her to get additional
 
05:21:01.628 --> 05:21:01.638 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic and follow-up care not
 
05:21:04.868 --> 05:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
everyone has the ability to
 
05:21:07.750 --> 05:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
go and get that
 
05:21:10.390 --> 05:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
care we would argue that it's important
 
05:21:12.510 --> 05:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to access that care
 
05:21:14.868 --> 05:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
and that the 180 lives that may be lost
 
05:21:16.788 --> 05:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire this year
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
are important and God forbid any of them
 
05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
lose their life because they couldn't
 
05:21:24.270 --> 05:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
afford followup care I don't want that
 
05:21:27.270 --> 05:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
on my conscience personally and 20 other
 
05:21:29.030 --> 05:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
states in this Union have decided they
 
05:21:31.270 --> 05:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
don't want it on their conscience either
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
States including the liberal bastions of
 
05:21:37.190 --> 05:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
Texas and Louisiana and
 
05:21:40.150 --> 05:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
Tennessee um New York I'll give you
 
05:21:42.548 --> 05:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
Illinois I mean it's across the Spectrum
 
05:21:44.868 --> 05:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
this is not a red state blue State thing
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
this is uh States understanding that
 
05:21:52.110 --> 05:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
there are this is a real issue for their
 
05:21:54.430 --> 05:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
constituents and that they want to take
 
05:21:58.110 --> 05:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
action and that costs can be a barrier
 
05:22:01.230 --> 05:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
to preventative care and that that they
 
05:22:03.708 --> 05:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to take action on that L there 20
 
05:22:05.470 --> 05:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
States that's an impressive number this
 
05:22:09.270 --> 05:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
is not uh New Hampshire going out on a
 
05:22:12.390 --> 05:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
limb the Cancer Society sees this as a
 
05:22:14.548 --> 05:22:14.558 align:start position:0%
Continuum you know when you go in for
 
05:22:16.230 --> 05:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
that initial screening and if you need a
 
05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
followup because there's an adality in
 
05:22:20.708 --> 05:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
in that initial
 
05:22:23.270 --> 05:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
screening it's a Continuum it's not a
 
05:22:25.948 --> 05:22:25.958 align:start position:0%
oneand done and you're out the door I
 
05:22:27.310 --> 05:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
think you just heard from a physician
 
05:22:30.948 --> 05:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
that you know it's not it's not uncommon
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
common for her to have to have follow-up
 
05:22:35.230 --> 05:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
care for some of her patients and those
 
05:22:37.390 --> 05:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
people deserve just as much care as the
 
05:22:39.190 --> 05:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
person that came in and was able to get
 
05:22:43.350 --> 05:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
done and one and done and you know
 
05:22:46.070 --> 05:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
and my ironically enough my wife
 
05:22:47.750 --> 05:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
actually had her mamogram
 
05:22:51.270 --> 05:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
today it's um all the stars were alining
 
05:22:51.280 --> 05:22:53.110 align:start position:0%
today it's um all the stars were alining
apparently

05:22:53.110 --> 05:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
05:22:57.350 --> 05:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
um she last the last year the year
 
05:23:02.230 --> 05:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
before last had to have a followup
 
05:23:05.030 --> 05:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
um doesn't happen every time but she did
 
05:23:07.270 --> 05:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
have to go she has a family
 
05:23:07.280 --> 05:23:08.990 align:start position:0%
have to go she has a family
history

05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
history
 
05:23:09.000 --> 05:23:10.868 align:start position:0%
history
um

05:23:10.868 --> 05:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:13.350 --> 05:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
um she
 
05:23:16.670 --> 05:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
um and you know it's fine but um we were
 
05:23:18.390 --> 05:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
able to cover whatever cost we were
 
05:23:20.990 --> 05:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
lucky though not everyone is in that
 
05:23:25.510 --> 05:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
position in every Granite stator
 
05:23:28.750 --> 05:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
regardless should have the same same
 
05:23:32.910 --> 05:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
access to to to the same care that that
 
05:23:35.470 --> 05:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
that my wife had and the same the same
 
05:23:38.430 --> 05:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
chance of survival if they do catch it
 
05:23:40.750 --> 05:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
and that's all we're asking is sort of
 
05:23:43.110 --> 05:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
even the playing field um as they have
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
done in 20 other states so we' ask you
 
05:23:48.670 --> 05:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
for your support um again I've got the
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
written testimony but you don't need to
 
05:23:51.708 --> 05:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
hear me read it and you've heard more
 
05:23:53.390 --> 05:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
than enough from from these other folks
 
05:23:56.030 --> 05:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
so we would ask you to please support uh
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1296 I'd be happy to answer
 
05:23:58.920 --> 05:23:59.788 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1296 I'd be happy to answer
any

05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:23:59.798 --> 05:24:02.390 align:start position:0%
any
questions

05:24:02.390 --> 05:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:24:05.190 --> 05:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
05:24:09.788 --> 05:24:09.798 align:start position:0%
grassy thank you Mr R um I you know when
 
05:24:12.990 --> 05:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
you take a look at the cost of of cancer
 
05:24:14.510 --> 05:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
particularly breast cancer and its
 
05:24:15.990 --> 05:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
emotional impact on families everything
 
05:24:17.310 --> 05:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if anybody has ever
 
05:24:20.270 --> 05:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
calculated out what the cost is because
 
05:24:21.470 --> 05:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
this is what the insurance companies are
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about because it it affects
 
05:24:26.350 --> 05:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
their premiums what's the cost of
 
05:24:29.510 --> 05:24:29.520 align:start position:0%

only in treatment of early uh detection
 
05:24:38.430 --> 05:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
as opposed to not catching it early and
 
05:24:40.510 --> 05:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
having long-term treatment and even
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
death from breast cancer has the Cancer

05:24:49.948 --> 05:24:49.958 align:start position:0%
costs I believe we
 
05:24:52.868 --> 05:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
have um I don't have a number to give
 
05:24:52.878 --> 05:24:53.948 align:start position:0%
have um I don't have a number to give
you

05:24:53.948 --> 05:24:53.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:24:56.628 --> 05:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
today I can tell you
 
05:24:56.638 --> 05:24:58.590 align:start position:0%
today I can tell you
that

05:24:58.590 --> 05:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:25:02.948 --> 05:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
catching uh a cancer stage one at
 
05:25:07.150 --> 05:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
beginning stages is much better for the
 
05:25:11.070 --> 05:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
patient uh more likely to have a better
 
05:25:14.190 --> 05:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
outcome uh not always but you have a
 
05:25:17.200 --> 05:25:17.210 align:start position:0%
better chance of survival you have
 
05:25:17.210 --> 05:25:18.868 align:start position:0%
better chance of survival you have

[Music]
 
05:25:23.350 --> 05:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
um less resources perhaps
 
05:25:29.110 --> 05:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
um uh on the system being used um I I I
 
05:25:31.830 --> 05:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
tend to worry less about that than than
 
05:25:34.430 --> 05:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
what the actual person has to go through
 
05:25:36.110 --> 05:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
I know it's important to have to worry
 
05:25:38.670 --> 05:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
about that but um but there are costs of
 
05:25:40.590 --> 05:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
course associated with Cancer Care and I
 
05:25:42.590 --> 05:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
don't have the number at the moment but
 
05:25:45.310 --> 05:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
um I can look and find out I know that
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
we have we have looked at that across
 
05:25:48.830 --> 05:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
the country and I'll see if I can try to
 
05:25:50.470 --> 05:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
find it for you but I I don't know if we
 
05:25:52.628 --> 05:25:52.638 align:start position:0%
have the analysis how up to date it is
 
05:25:54.110 --> 05:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
at the moment but I'll try to find it
 
05:25:54.120 --> 05:25:56.150 align:start position:0%
at the moment but I'll try to find it
for

05:25:56.150 --> 05:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:25:59.548 --> 05:25:59.558 align:start position:0%
you representative Ammon thank you Mr
 
05:26:01.270 --> 05:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for your testim
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
and your personal uh sharing your
 
05:26:05.310 --> 05:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
personal stories you mentioned there's
 
05:26:08.670 --> 05:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
new cancer uh American Cancer Society
 
05:26:10.590 --> 05:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
data that was released I think you said
 
05:26:12.430 --> 05:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday just this morning actually
 
05:26:14.150 --> 05:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
just this morning yeah I don't know if
 
05:26:15.548 --> 05:26:15.558 align:start position:0%
you've had a chance to look at those I'm
 
05:26:18.310 --> 05:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
curious about the progress that we're
 
05:26:20.548 --> 05:26:20.558 align:start position:0%
making on cancer is it getting worse or
 
05:26:23.310 --> 05:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
is it getting better um and if it's
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
getting worse
 
05:26:27.750 --> 05:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll have a followup question
 
05:26:30.750 --> 05:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
for that well it depends so there's that
 
05:26:33.910 --> 05:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
for an non-an for you right it depends
 
05:26:36.948 --> 05:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
um it depends on cancer is not one
 
05:26:39.150 --> 05:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
disease right it's it's hundreds of
 
05:26:42.510 --> 05:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
diseases so there have been great
 
05:26:44.708 --> 05:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
breakthroughs and great strides in
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
certain types of cancers breast cancer
 
05:26:51.708 --> 05:26:51.718 align:start position:0%
for instance there are there are uh uh
 
05:26:54.270 --> 05:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
different ways to uh to treat there are
 
05:26:54.280 --> 05:26:55.350 align:start position:0%
different ways to uh to treat there are

05:27:02.110 --> 05:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
um I think of um preventative screenings
 
05:27:06.070 --> 05:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
that have uh been developed um for uh
 
05:27:11.070 --> 05:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
for lung cancer recently um there are um
 
05:27:11.080 --> 05:27:12.090 align:start position:0%
for lung cancer recently um there are um
obviously

05:27:12.090 --> 05:27:12.100 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
05:27:12.100 --> 05:27:14.070 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
05:27:16.868 --> 05:27:16.878 align:start position:0%
um preventative screenings for colon
 
05:27:20.990 --> 05:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
cancer where we have um we have worked
 
05:27:24.868 --> 05:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
very diligently to uh offset uh cost
 
05:27:27.470 --> 05:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
sharing there as well to make sure that
 
05:27:29.470 --> 05:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
when you go under I mean I've been
 
05:27:32.510 --> 05:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
having my uh annual colonoscopy since I
 
05:27:35.310 --> 05:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
turned 30 because I lost both my father
 
05:27:38.390 --> 05:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
my uncle and my grandfather colon cancer
 
05:27:41.590 --> 05:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
so they said you get to go early um so
 
05:27:44.510 --> 05:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
I've been having them for 20 years now
 
05:27:48.788 --> 05:27:48.798 align:start position:0%
um so aren't I lucky but um but one time
 
05:27:50.230 --> 05:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
you would you would go and you'd go
 
05:27:51.830 --> 05:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
under and you'd wake up and you'd get a
 
05:27:54.110 --> 05:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
bill you know so some people stopped
 
05:27:57.548 --> 05:27:57.558 align:start position:0%
going you know so uh because they didn't
 
05:28:00.990 --> 05:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
want to wake up with that surprise um
 
05:28:03.390 --> 05:28:03.400 align:start position:0%
but uh we we've made great strides there
 
05:28:07.070 --> 05:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
so you know but anyway so it depends I'm
 
05:28:09.548 --> 05:28:09.558 align:start position:0%
sorry we made great strides where people
 
05:28:11.548 --> 05:28:11.558 align:start position:0%
are going to get tested so you can go
 
05:28:13.948 --> 05:28:13.958 align:start position:0%
and you get you you you can you can you
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
can avoid a colon cancer diagnosis by
 
05:28:18.350 --> 05:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
getting a poop removed I guess is my
 
05:28:19.788 --> 05:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
point Mr chairman I see your your look
 
05:28:21.788 --> 05:28:21.798 align:start position:0%
on your face as to why you think well
 
05:28:25.910 --> 05:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's every five years well depends yes
 
05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
but some people annual so you know when
 
05:28:32.390 --> 05:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
but repres was asking me about about
 
05:28:34.708 --> 05:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
cancer rates in general there are
 
05:28:35.910 --> 05:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
different there are different reasons
 
05:28:37.750 --> 05:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
why some may go down and some may go up
 
05:28:40.948 --> 05:28:40.958 align:start position:0%
but So Co for instance had delayed a lot
 
05:28:42.270 --> 05:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
of people from getting preventative
 
05:28:46.110 --> 05:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
screenings so we're only a very short
 
05:28:48.470 --> 05:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
amount of time out of the the the the
 
05:28:52.910 --> 05:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
Heyday of the pandemic right so we don't
 
05:28:55.750 --> 05:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
know how what the delayed screenings
 
05:28:59.070 --> 05:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
will have will mean to to Future uh
 
05:29:01.350 --> 05:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
cancer rates in in the in the next 5 10
 
05:29:03.548 --> 05:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
years so it's hard to answer I I should
 
05:29:05.150 --> 05:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
have narrowed it down to just death
 
05:29:07.310 --> 05:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
rates from cancer I mean that that would
 
05:29:09.470 --> 05:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
probably be a harder I think it's it's
 
05:29:10.830 --> 05:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's the same rambling
 
05:29:14.310 --> 05:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.430 --> 05:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative okay representative Gibbs
 
05:29:22.310 --> 05:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh in terms of the need for
 
05:29:25.708 --> 05:29:25.718 align:start position:0%
additional diagnostic tests following
 
05:29:28.590 --> 05:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
screenings and the additional outof
 
05:29:30.990 --> 05:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
pocket costs for those additional
 
05:29:33.788 --> 05:29:33.798 align:start position:0%
diagnostic tests how does breast cancer
 
05:29:36.548 --> 05:29:36.558 align:start position:0%
compare to other types of cancer as for
 
05:29:42.150 --> 05:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:45.030 --> 05:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
cancer can you ask ask me the question
 
05:29:46.390 --> 05:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure if I'm following
 
05:29:50.230 --> 05:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
exactly okay um uh there's been a lot of
 
05:29:52.590 --> 05:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
discussion about how following the
 
05:29:54.910 --> 05:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
initial screening which is the
 
05:29:59.510 --> 05:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
mamogram right there if if if there's um
 
05:30:01.430 --> 05:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
something unusual ual scene and this
 
05:30:04.628 --> 05:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
happened to me once yeah um then
 
05:30:08.190 --> 05:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
additional diagnostic tests are are
 
05:30:11.670 --> 05:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
necessary um and that there are greater
 
05:30:14.430 --> 05:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket costs for those additional
 
05:30:16.788 --> 05:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
diagnostic tests and that what that's
 
05:30:18.590 --> 05:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
what this bill is supposed to address
 
05:30:22.110 --> 05:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
right what I'm asking is in terms of the
 
05:30:24.868 --> 05:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
need for additional diagnostic tests and
 
05:30:27.708 --> 05:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
the out-of-pocket cost for those tests
 
05:30:27.718 --> 05:30:28.910 align:start position:0%
the out-of-pocket cost for those tests
after

05:30:28.910 --> 05:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
after
 
05:30:32.430 --> 05:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
screening how does breast cancer compare
 
05:30:36.190 --> 05:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
to other types of cancer well so you you
 
05:30:39.830 --> 05:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
brought up a prostate um so a PSA test
 
05:30:43.470 --> 05:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
is not actually covered so so for
 
05:30:46.350 --> 05:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
instance so mamography isn't covered
 
05:30:48.350 --> 05:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
like isn't one of the essential health
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
benefits like uh under the Affordable
 
05:30:53.788 --> 05:30:53.798 align:start position:0%
Care Act like um PSA isn't covered the
 
05:30:57.030 --> 05:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
same way that test wasn't included under
 
05:31:00.590 --> 05:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
the ACA so there is um depending on your
 
05:31:03.070 --> 05:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
your uh your your individual plan you
 
05:31:05.510 --> 05:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
may or may not have uh cost sharing
 
05:31:07.628 --> 05:31:07.638 align:start position:0%
there I guess I don't my plan doesn't
 
05:31:10.310 --> 05:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
have any so I all I can speak is from my
 
05:31:13.310 --> 05:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
personal experience with PSA testing uh
 
05:31:13.320 --> 05:31:14.910 align:start position:0%
personal experience with PSA testing uh
there

05:31:14.910 --> 05:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't think they they're not um
 
05:31:20.230 --> 05:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
you're not talking apples to apples
 
05:31:22.030 --> 05:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't think
 
05:31:24.750 --> 05:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
so there aren't um I think there are
 
05:31:27.788 --> 05:31:27.798 align:start position:0%
additional there would be more C sharing
 
05:31:30.110 --> 05:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
with a breast diagnosis a breast cancer
 
05:31:32.310 --> 05:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
cancer diagnosis than with others as far
 
05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
as I'm aware
 
05:31:37.430 --> 05:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
of actually I want to pick up there yes
 
05:31:40.708 --> 05:31:40.718 align:start position:0%
sir uh tell me a a cheap cancer I don't
 
05:31:43.430 --> 05:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
think there is one exactly so the only
 
05:31:45.270 --> 05:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
reason why this bill wouldn't you say
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
the only reason this bill is here is
 
05:31:52.310 --> 05:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
because these test machines are so damn
 
05:31:54.868 --> 05:31:54.878 align:start position:0%
expensive right the colon now let's say
 
05:31:57.670 --> 05:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
the you know the prostate is you know
 
05:31:59.430 --> 05:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
you say you know that they were don't
 
05:32:01.708 --> 05:32:01.718 align:start position:0%
really have a has but let's there a test
 
05:32:05.070 --> 05:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
it's a blood test for for PSA test BL
 
05:32:08.430 --> 05:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
test but when you have the actual
 
05:32:12.310 --> 05:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
surgery MH or you actually like let's
 
05:32:14.390 --> 05:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
take much more dramatic cancers like
 
05:32:17.628 --> 05:32:17.638 align:start position:0%
esophageal or colon cancers where you've
 
05:32:19.750 --> 05:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
got to take some pretty serious
 
05:32:23.830 --> 05:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
drugs and they're really expensive
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
MH what's the difference between an
 
05:32:31.510 --> 05:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
expensive drug treatment plan okay and
 
05:32:31.520 --> 05:32:32.708 align:start position:0%
expensive drug treatment plan okay and
this

05:32:32.708 --> 05:32:32.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
bill what's the difference between being
 
05:32:36.830 --> 05:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
having already being diagnosed having
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
cancer and going on a drug versus a
 
05:32:40.190 --> 05:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
preventative screening test well no the
 
05:32:41.990 --> 05:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
preventative you don't have to get there
 
05:32:45.030 --> 05:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
oh no no that's only one test okay but
 
05:32:47.708 --> 05:32:47.718 align:start position:0%
then the rest of your life You' got to
 
05:32:50.230 --> 05:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
have these this preventative so-called
 
05:32:52.230 --> 05:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
preventative but we just heard that you
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
don't get cheap you don't get the cheap
 
05:32:56.390 --> 05:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
affordable onetime
 
05:33:00.030 --> 05:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
test I did not hear that this test is on
 
05:33:01.390 --> 05:33:01.400 align:start position:0%
only a onetime
 
05:33:06.030 --> 05:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
test I heard is that you can get it you
 
05:33:08.110 --> 05:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
would pretty much want to do this
 
05:33:10.830 --> 05:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
annually once you've been diagnosed with
 
05:33:13.350 --> 05:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
cancer so I'm just saying where's the
 
05:33:16.910 --> 05:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
cheap cancer I think what I think you
 
05:33:16.920 --> 05:33:18.510 align:start position:0%
cheap cancer I think what I think you
may

05:33:18.510 --> 05:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
may
 
05:33:21.830 --> 05:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
be perhaps misunderstanding what the
 
05:33:23.990 --> 05:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
doctor may have said I think what she
 
05:33:27.190 --> 05:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
said if you have been diagnosed right
 
05:33:29.750 --> 05:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
with breast cancer correct then you were
 
05:33:32.750 --> 05:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
in in a different category right and you
 
05:33:34.708 --> 05:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
would go back and get the same
 
05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
test it's different you going go back
 
05:33:38.830 --> 05:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
and get the cheap mamography test no
 
05:33:40.548 --> 05:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
you're in a different category because
 
05:33:42.948 --> 05:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
you've now had cancer and you you're
 
05:33:44.750 --> 05:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
you're you you're no you're you're
 
05:33:47.230 --> 05:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
tested in a different way you you can
 
05:33:48.910 --> 05:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
come back up and explain it to you I'm
 
05:33:52.030 --> 05:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the cost of this machine
 
05:33:54.390 --> 05:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
the reason why this bill is in here
 
05:33:56.910 --> 05:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
which machine
 
05:33:59.670 --> 05:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
this what are you calling this machine
 
05:34:03.910 --> 05:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
the 3D mamography machine 3D scan the 3D
 
05:34:06.948 --> 05:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
scanner whatever okay so here here's
 
05:34:10.150 --> 05:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying any cancer is
 
05:34:13.030 --> 05:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
expensive when we well we hear today
 
05:34:15.628 --> 05:34:15.638 align:start position:0%
this Tes to treat if you have to treat
 
05:34:19.310 --> 05:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
it exactly so what we have here in terms
 
05:34:23.310 --> 05:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
of when you have been diagnosed uhhuh
 
05:34:25.030 --> 05:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay because you you you flunk the
 
05:34:27.350 --> 05:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
original test right okay now you're
 
05:34:28.948 --> 05:34:28.958 align:start position:0%
going to go in and now they're going to
 
05:34:32.830 --> 05:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
charge you $2,000 for the same test
 
05:34:34.910 --> 05:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
different no it's
 
05:34:37.270 --> 05:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
not that's what she's been trying she
 
05:34:38.590 --> 05:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
tried to explain to you she could
 
05:34:40.110 --> 05:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
probably come back up and explain it is
 
05:34:42.670 --> 05:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
it a different I can see her is it the
 
05:34:44.230 --> 05:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
it's the same diagnostic you're
 
05:34:46.350 --> 05:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
diagnostic whether you're still have the
 
05:34:48.948 --> 05:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
tumors or still have pups or whatever
 
05:34:50.548 --> 05:34:50.558 align:start position:0%
whatever you still have stuff in there
 
05:34:50.558 --> 05:34:54.030 align:start position:0%
whatever you still have stuff in there
right

05:34:54.030 --> 05:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
and maybe the doctor should come back up
 
05:34:59.190 --> 05:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
and explain he's right there so you're
 
05:35:00.708 --> 05:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
when you've been diagnosed with breast
 
05:35:06.190 --> 05:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
cancer so we call a diagnostic mamogram
 
05:35:08.310 --> 05:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
any mamogram that is not a screening
 
05:35:11.110 --> 05:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
mamogram and a screening mamogram is
 
05:35:14.868 --> 05:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
only for women who have no symptoms no
 
05:35:16.470 --> 05:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
active breast cancer it's the same
 
05:35:19.230 --> 05:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
machine the pictures are different right
 
05:35:21.910 --> 05:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
the pictures are are more tailored to
 
05:35:24.868 --> 05:35:24.878 align:start position:0%
the problem and the examination is read
 
05:35:27.310 --> 05:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
real time so that's what a diagnostic H
 
05:35:29.548 --> 05:35:29.558 align:start position:0%
but you still you'll never do it again
 
05:35:32.350 --> 05:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
so when you've had breast cancer for a
 
05:35:34.070 --> 05:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
recent breast cancer diagnosis if you
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
were diagnosed with breast cancer in
 
05:35:39.270 --> 05:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
2021 right you will be asked to return
 
05:35:41.670 --> 05:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
as a diagnostic mamogram patient not a
 
05:35:44.990 --> 05:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
screening mamogram patient for years
 
05:35:47.310 --> 05:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
while we watch your breast more closely
 
05:35:48.990 --> 05:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the cancer doesn't
 
05:35:51.830 --> 05:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
return and Screen the opposite side but
 
05:35:53.708 --> 05:35:53.718 align:start position:0%
to get rid of that
 
05:35:57.310 --> 05:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
cancer you had to pay take expensive
 
05:36:01.310 --> 05:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
drugs right not always
 
05:36:02.948 --> 05:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
you mean there's a cheap cancer drug out
 
05:36:05.150 --> 05:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
there so well you don't always need
 
05:36:07.430 --> 05:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
drugs for a breast cancer sometimes it's
 
05:36:09.030 --> 05:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
just surgery just the remove just the
 
05:36:11.910 --> 05:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
removal okay and so then for the the one
 
05:36:13.590 --> 05:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
you go back a year later you're just
 
05:36:15.750 --> 05:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
going to get the cheap the the one the
 
05:36:19.030 --> 05:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
the the the test that's covered free no
 
05:36:20.708 --> 05:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
you're still going to have to pay for it
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I'm talking about if
 
05:36:25.868 --> 05:36:25.878 align:start position:0%
you've had if you've had breast cancer
 
05:36:29.070 --> 05:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
if you were diagnosed this year for um
 
05:36:31.070 --> 05:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
it say
 
05:36:32.910 --> 05:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
you know 2024 with breast cancer
 
05:36:35.150 --> 05:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
diagnosis you were treated entirely in
 
05:36:37.868 --> 05:36:37.878 align:start position:0%
2024 you would be in a diagnostic
 
05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
mamogram category for two years five
 
05:36:43.788 --> 05:36:43.798 align:start position:0%
years and how much is that test so that
 
05:36:47.230 --> 05:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
test is yeah $1,000 could be depending
 
05:36:49.150 --> 05:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
on the facility you go to and you're in
 
05:36:52.430 --> 05:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
you're out okay okay thank you so I I do
 
05:36:54.510 --> 05:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
have I do understand the situation the
 
05:36:56.270 --> 05:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
reason I'm trying to describe this to
 
05:36:56.280 --> 05:36:57.990 align:start position:0%
reason I'm trying to describe this to
you

05:36:57.990 --> 05:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
Ry the reason why I'm going through this
 
05:37:03.990 --> 05:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
with you Ry is that you represent cancer
 
05:37:04.000 --> 05:37:05.948 align:start position:0%
with you Ry is that you represent cancer
right

05:37:05.948 --> 05:37:05.958 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:37:08.510 --> 05:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
so and I think we've had bills before in
 
05:37:12.430 --> 05:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
the past on cancer bills sure my fear is
 
05:37:15.270 --> 05:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
that if we pass this legislation uhuh
 
05:37:16.990 --> 05:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
with no deductibles we said okay we're
 
05:37:19.390 --> 05:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to get rid of the
 
05:37:22.708 --> 05:37:22.718 align:start position:0%
deductibles what other Cancer Treatments
 
05:37:26.430 --> 05:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is supplemental screening
 
05:37:29.670 --> 05:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's screening okay but the screening
 
05:37:33.430 --> 05:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
every year it's a annual screening yes
 
05:37:34.910 --> 05:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
not the same as for people that have
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
been diagnosed
 
05:37:39.070 --> 05:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
I'm may I ask a question representative
 
05:37:40.750 --> 05:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank
 
05:37:44.948 --> 05:37:44.958 align:start position:0%
you is the diagnostic mamogram that the
 
05:37:47.390 --> 05:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
patient will have to have perhaps every
 
05:37:50.590 --> 05:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
year for years after the problem has
 
05:37:53.190 --> 05:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
been found is that can I finish my
 
05:37:56.470 --> 05:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
question is that more expensive than the
 
05:37:59.230 --> 05:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
regular screening mamogram that someone
 
05:38:01.830 --> 05:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
gets is it is it notably more expensive
 
05:38:04.510 --> 05:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
as far as I know yes but it's different
 
05:38:07.750 --> 05:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:11.430 --> 05:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
is I'm all done it's not the same thing
 
05:38:13.670 --> 05:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
though I'm all done I'm I'm all I'm all
 
05:38:15.670 --> 05:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
set I got it are we debating here yeah
 
05:38:17.830 --> 05:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
exactly apparently we are but it's not
 
05:38:20.910 --> 05:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
the same thing I I I'm totally wrong I
 
05:38:22.910 --> 05:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
have no idea what I'm talking about I'm
 
05:38:25.510 --> 05:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
not suggesting I have no fear that no
 
05:38:27.868 --> 05:38:27.878 align:start position:0%
other cancer bill is going to come in
 
05:38:31.670 --> 05:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
and say we want to be be deductible free
 
05:38:31.680 --> 05:38:32.548 align:start position:0%
and say we want to be be deductible free
for

05:38:32.548 --> 05:38:32.558 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:38:35.430 --> 05:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
screenings I who knows what it is it's
 
05:38:37.670 --> 05:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
cancer cancer is a bad thing don't you
 
05:38:39.390 --> 05:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
think well yes I do think cancer is a
 
05:38:40.750 --> 05:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
bad thing and I think it's very
 
05:38:42.190 --> 05:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
important that people get preventative
 
05:38:44.948 --> 05:38:44.958 align:start position:0%
screenings but I don't think it's a joke
 
05:38:47.510 --> 05:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm uh this is not a joke I don't think
 
05:38:49.910 --> 05:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
it is either but I think it's being I
 
05:38:52.830 --> 05:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
think I'm being spoken to like it is I
 
05:38:56.150 --> 05:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
am very sorry if you feel that way I was
 
05:38:57.830 --> 05:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
being very serious I don't think you
 
05:38:59.510 --> 05:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
were Mr chairman I've known you for
 
05:39:02.628 --> 05:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
almost 30 years I don't think you
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
were it's thank you very much and I have
 
05:39:06.788 --> 05:39:06.798 align:start position:0%
a great deal of respect for you I truly
 
05:39:09.310 --> 05:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
do but I know when you're joking with me
 
05:39:11.548 --> 05:39:11.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
05:39:14.150 --> 05:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
you I have no other cards so I will
 
05:39:16.390 --> 05:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
close the public
 
05:39:16.400 --> 05:39:18.750 align:start position:0%
close the public
hearing

05:39:18.750 --> 05:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:39:22.350 --> 05:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
oh okay Representative Steve Boer wants
 
05:39:22.360 --> 05:39:25.030 align:start position:0%
oh okay Representative Steve Boer wants
to

05:39:25.030 --> 05:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:28.440 --> 05:39:30.788 align:start position:0%
 
Steve

05:39:30.788 --> 05:39:30.798 align:start position:0%
Steve
 
05:39:33.310 --> 05:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um I've been sitting here
 
05:39:35.708 --> 05:39:35.718 align:start position:0%
listening and I was holding the card to
 
05:39:38.150 --> 05:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
last because I didn't
 
05:39:41.070 --> 05:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
realize I didn't want to waste your time
 
05:39:44.270 --> 05:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
going over the same thing over and over
 
05:39:48.230 --> 05:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
again but it occurred to me that we're
 
05:39:51.510 --> 05:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
missing I think we're overlooking what
 
05:39:55.788 --> 05:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:59.590 --> 05:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
do what this bill is doing is when a a
 
05:40:03.310 --> 05:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
lady goes in a woman goes in and has a
 
05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
test they find in this test a dark
 
05:40:12.708 --> 05:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
spot so then after they get the little
 
05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
letter in the mail saying we've seen a
 
05:40:15.360 --> 05:40:16.350 align:start position:0%
letter in the mail saying we've seen a
dark

05:40:16.350 --> 05:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
dark
 
05:40:19.548 --> 05:40:19.558 align:start position:0%
spot we recommend you to go and have
 
05:40:22.548 --> 05:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
another look
 
05:40:26.468 --> 05:40:26.478 align:start position:0%
see so now the woman has to make a
 
05:40:30.150 --> 05:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
second appointment for another test
 
05:40:32.830 --> 05:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
test there has been no
 
05:40:36.310 --> 05:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
Diagnostics done there's nothing done
 
05:40:38.310 --> 05:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
other than the fact that they now have
 
05:40:41.390 --> 05:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
to go have this secondary
 
05:40:44.830 --> 05:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
test this secondary test comes out of
 
05:40:44.840 --> 05:40:45.948 align:start position:0%
test this secondary test comes out of
their

05:40:45.948 --> 05:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:40:49.590 --> 05:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
pocket because it falls in the
 
05:40:49.600 --> 05:40:51.310 align:start position:0%
pocket because it falls in the
deductible

05:40:51.310 --> 05:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
deductible
 
05:40:55.270 --> 05:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
so they go and take this test they still
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what they
 
05:41:01.310 --> 05:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
have the test is
 
05:41:05.030 --> 05:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
done they then determine is there
 
05:41:08.628 --> 05:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
something more has to be done after the
 
05:41:08.638 --> 05:41:10.310 align:start position:0%
something more has to be done after the
secondary

05:41:10.310 --> 05:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
secondary
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
test still no diagnostic they still not
 
05:41:16.670 --> 05:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
been said they had cancer and there's a
 
05:41:21.230 --> 05:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:25.430 --> 05:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
cancer they just have an ABM
 
05:41:30.110 --> 05:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
morality so if they go for that third
 
05:41:34.110 --> 05:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
test once again it becomes out of that
 
05:41:34.120 --> 05:41:38.110 align:start position:0%
test once again it becomes out of that
high

05:41:38.110 --> 05:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:41.070 --> 05:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
deductibility at that point this third
 
05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:51.910 --> 05:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
cancer so at that point it switches from
 
05:41:51.920 --> 05:41:53.270 align:start position:0%
cancer so at that point it switches from
this

05:41:53.270 --> 05:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:41:57.190 --> 05:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
plan to now you're diagnosed with cancer
 
05:42:01.390 --> 05:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
you fall under your 8020 or your 75
 
05:42:05.350 --> 05:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
whatever it is 6040 plan portion because
 
05:42:07.190 --> 05:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
to get to that point you've already
 
05:42:09.990 --> 05:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
burned up your high deductibility just
 
05:42:13.990 --> 05:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
paying for the tests to figure out do I
 
05:42:17.070 --> 05:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:20.708 --> 05:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
problem so when one's saying oh you've
 
05:42:24.070 --> 05:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
got cancer way up here no we're not
 
05:42:26.110 --> 05:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
talking about cancer way up here we're
 
05:42:28.868 --> 05:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
just talking out trying to figure out a
 
05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
plan plan to figure out what's
 
05:42:35.708 --> 05:42:35.718 align:start position:0%
wrong and what this Bill is saying is
 
05:42:38.830 --> 05:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
please allow this
 
05:42:43.948 --> 05:42:43.958 align:start position:0%
person to be able to get through a B to
 
05:42:47.510 --> 05:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
C to figure out what it is because a
 
05:42:50.510 --> 05:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
majority of the time after they've been
 
05:42:50.520 --> 05:42:51.270 align:start position:0%
majority of the time after they've been
to

05:42:51.270 --> 05:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:42:54.990 --> 05:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
be they found out there's no other issue
 
05:42:59.670 --> 05:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
then they go back into normal Cycles of
 
05:43:02.670 --> 05:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
doing their testing whereas if they have
 
05:43:05.468 --> 05:43:05.478 align:start position:0%
to go to C and they're diagnosed then
 
05:43:07.788 --> 05:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
yes they're put in a special category
 
05:43:10.030 --> 05:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
which then says you have to have your
 
05:43:14.190 --> 05:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
screening and it's not deductible so as
 
05:43:17.350 --> 05:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
trying to separate the two together this
 
05:43:22.350 --> 05:43:22.360 align:start position:0%
bill is only trying to address a and b
 
05:43:26.150 --> 05:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
not C doesn't say if I have cancer now I
 
05:43:28.628 --> 05:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
want you to pay for it all it's saying
 
05:43:28.638 --> 05:43:29.750 align:start position:0%
want you to pay for it all it's saying
is

05:43:29.750 --> 05:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:43:32.670 --> 05:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
I want to be able to have this test
 
05:43:35.070 --> 05:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
where the first one is the
 
05:43:38.788 --> 05:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
screen that says oh you got the spot we
 
05:43:40.868 --> 05:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
don't know what the spot
 
05:43:44.230 --> 05:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
is and then B that's where they do a
 
05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
finer Point as the doctor said they do
 
05:43:52.150 --> 05:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
the finer points of things to make the
 
05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
determination is it cancer we still
 
05:43:57.830 --> 05:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
don't know until they've done that and
 
05:44:01.670 --> 05:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is only Happ asking that that
 
05:44:04.430 --> 05:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
portion up until
 
05:44:08.190 --> 05:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:11.310 --> 05:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
diagnosed is covered as part of your
 
05:44:14.910 --> 05:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
free mamogram that's what it's trying to
 
05:44:17.070 --> 05:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish representative grassy has a
 
05:44:18.670 --> 05:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
question so if I'm understanding this
 
05:44:20.708 --> 05:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
correctly based on all of the comments
 
05:44:22.070 --> 05:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
were made previously you're saying once
 
05:44:23.350 --> 05:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
a person has been
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
diagnosed these treatments are no longer
 
05:44:27.990 --> 05:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
diagnostic they're now part of the
 
05:44:30.270 --> 05:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
treatment that that's correct thank you
 
05:44:33.430 --> 05:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that follows that path C it would go
 
05:44:35.230 --> 05:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
under the insurance plan that goes under
 
05:44:36.590 --> 05:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
the insurance
 
05:44:36.600 --> 05:44:39.910 align:start position:0%
the insurance
plan

05:44:39.910 --> 05:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:43.270 --> 05:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
correct that's in layman's term I I
 
05:44:45.110 --> 05:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
guess I misunderstood because I thought
 
05:44:47.750 --> 05:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
from every other test that that patient
 
05:44:50.750 --> 05:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
takes for the rest of their
 
05:44:56.190 --> 05:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
life is going to not be the simple the
 
05:44:58.990 --> 05:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
the regular thing the the free one the
 
05:45:01.230 --> 05:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
free one was talking talking and walking
 
05:45:03.350 --> 05:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
or walking and talking but the once
 
05:45:06.310 --> 05:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
you've been diagnosed you're no longer a
 
05:45:09.468 --> 05:45:09.478 align:start position:0%
walker talker you're now going to have
 
05:45:12.670 --> 05:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:15.910 --> 05:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
annually for the yes the
 
05:45:19.230 --> 05:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
deductible not get it free like you
 
05:45:21.270 --> 05:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
would if you were still in the
 
05:45:23.990 --> 05:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
walkie-talkie so that means we're not
 
05:45:25.868 --> 05:45:25.878 align:start position:0%
just giving the
 
05:45:29.548 --> 05:45:29.558 align:start position:0%
,000 the first time they were taking
 
05:45:31.788 --> 05:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
that every time that woman goes in and
 
05:45:33.830 --> 05:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
gets another
 
05:45:37.270 --> 05:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
test every time she gets a diagnosis
 
05:45:41.868 --> 05:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
test she is going to be hit with ,000
 
05:45:45.030 --> 05:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
and what we're about to do is give her a
 
05:45:45.040 --> 05:45:46.948 align:start position:0%
and what we're about to do is give her a
lifetime

05:45:46.948 --> 05:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
lifetime
 
05:45:49.750 --> 05:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
waiver from that
 
05:45:52.110 --> 05:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
deductible you're only
 
05:45:56.948 --> 05:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
given no no okay well let's we'll figure
 
05:45:58.390 --> 05:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
this out we'll figure this out in the
 
05:45:58.400 --> 05:46:00.110 align:start position:0%
this out we'll figure this out in the
SubCom

05:46:00.110 --> 05:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
SubCom
 
05:46:04.430 --> 05:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:04.440 --> 05:46:14.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:46:14.990 --> 05:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:27.788 --> 05:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:27.798 --> 05:46:36.868 align:start position:0%
 
time

05:46:36.868 --> 05:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:38.150 --> 05:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
if you're going to testify please put
 
05:46:40.750 --> 05:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
turn in your cards so I know who I have
 
05:46:42.990 --> 05:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to be thinking that
 
05:46:44.350 --> 05:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
I'm getting near the end and all of a
 
05:46:48.708 --> 05:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:56.030 --> 05:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
yes what's
 
05:46:57.718 --> 05:46:59.628 align:start position:0%

has I I all I know was somebody put the
 
05:47:12.070 --> 05:47:12.080 align:start position:0%

Pro good afternoon Mark and I'm sorry

05:47:33.390 --> 05:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:37.150 --> 05:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
nothing good afternoon uh thank you Mr
 
05:47:39.750 --> 05:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and the committee uh my name is
 
05:47:44.110 --> 05:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
Mark PR I'm a representing Hillsboro 15
 
05:47:48.788 --> 05:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
which is Manchester w 8 uh today uh I'm
 
05:47:52.390 --> 05:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
introducing hos Bill
 
05:47:57.510 --> 05:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
1081 uh been a long day um and it's a
 
05:48:01.910 --> 05:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
simple housekeeping B that just directs
 
05:48:06.468 --> 05:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
health insurance companies to send the
 
05:48:11.030 --> 05:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
check for ambulance service to the
 
05:48:14.430 --> 05:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
ambulance right and not to the patient
 
05:48:18.150 --> 05:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
because uh what we hear is that a lot of
 
05:48:19.830 --> 05:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
them are confused why did I get this
 
05:48:22.110 --> 05:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
check what do I do with this check how
 
05:48:25.310 --> 05:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
do I do something with this check where
 
05:48:29.350 --> 05:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
am I sending it to right um so so
 
05:48:29.360 --> 05:48:30.468 align:start position:0%
am I sending it to right um so so
they're

05:48:30.468 --> 05:48:30.478 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:48:33.868 --> 05:48:33.878 align:start position:0%
inconveniencing the patient who isn't
 
05:48:35.590 --> 05:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
probably in in the best shape seeing how
 
05:48:37.310 --> 05:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
they just had to take an ambulance right
 
05:48:38.788 --> 05:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
and now they're trying to deal with this
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
when they probably have other things uh
 
05:48:47.390 --> 05:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:51.270 --> 05:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
know I've heard that insurance companies
 
05:48:55.190 --> 05:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
don't send checks to out of network Pro
 
05:48:57.948 --> 05:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
providers but I know I've used out of
 
05:49:01.110 --> 05:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
network doctors and I have never
 
05:49:03.468 --> 05:49:03.478 align:start position:0%
received a check for the doctor that I
 
05:49:06.150 --> 05:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
have to send to the doctor it always
 
05:49:08.150 --> 05:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
just goes right to the
 
05:49:11.350 --> 05:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
doctor and as far as I can tell and I've
 
05:49:12.990 --> 05:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
been at this for a little while couple
 
05:49:16.430 --> 05:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
of years now the ambulance emergency
 
05:49:16.440 --> 05:49:17.548 align:start position:0%
of years now the ambulance emergency
ambulance

05:49:17.548 --> 05:49:17.558 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
05:49:21.110 --> 05:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
service is the only one that they send
 
05:49:21.120 --> 05:49:22.510 align:start position:0%
service is the only one that they send
the

05:49:22.510 --> 05:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:49:25.270 --> 05:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
check to the
 
05:49:29.350 --> 05:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
patient not really sure why I kind of M
 
05:49:30.948 --> 05:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get us to go in
 
05:49:33.230 --> 05:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
network you know kind of blackmail us
 
05:49:34.868 --> 05:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
into doing it you know we'll send you
 
05:49:37.750 --> 05:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
the check if if you jump in our network
 
05:49:39.230 --> 05:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
but we really don't want to be in the
 
05:49:42.750 --> 05:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
network so
 
05:49:46.270 --> 05:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
um that's pretty much my gist on the
 
05:49:46.280 --> 05:49:48.150 align:start position:0%
um that's pretty much my gist on the
bill

05:49:48.150 --> 05:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:49:51.670 --> 05:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's a simple fix as you can
 
05:49:55.270 --> 05:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
see in the uh in the bill itself we're
 
05:49:57.750 --> 05:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
just crossing out one one line in this
 
05:50:00.190 --> 05:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
whole thing just cleans it up tells them
 
05:50:03.628 --> 05:50:03.638 align:start position:0%
to send it to us and and I think that's
 
05:50:06.270 --> 05:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
just better for everybody involved and
 
05:50:08.948 --> 05:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take questions okay
 
05:50:08.958 --> 05:50:10.270 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take questions okay
representative

05:50:10.270 --> 05:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:50:14.230 --> 05:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um and thank you for
 
05:50:17.110 --> 05:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
coming to testify uh uh I'm going to ask
 
05:50:19.788 --> 05:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
you if you're aware of two things um the
 
05:50:22.788 --> 05:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
first is that um at least as far as I
 
05:50:25.350 --> 05:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
know in conquered New Hampshire there
 
05:50:28.548 --> 05:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
are no in network and uh ambulance
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
providers that are in network with
 
05:50:33.548 --> 05:50:33.558 align:start position:0%
Anthem uh so Anthem always sends the
 
05:50:34.708 --> 05:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
check to the
 
05:50:40.230 --> 05:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
patient and uh are you aware of the
 
05:50:43.430 --> 05:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
incredible remarkable hassle it is for
 
05:50:45.670 --> 05:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
the patient to then deal with that check
 
05:50:47.670 --> 05:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
and figure out what to do with it and I
 
05:50:50.628 --> 05:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
speak here from personal experience um
 
05:50:52.750 --> 05:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
with an insurance company that said oh
 
05:50:55.830 --> 05:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
well they're out of network um and there
 
05:50:58.670 --> 05:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
are no in network ambulance providers
 
05:51:01.468 --> 05:51:01.478 align:start position:0%
and I said to the this person uh from
 
05:51:04.590 --> 05:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
the insurance company I said if you woke
 
05:51:07.350 --> 05:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
up at 3:00 in the morning in
 
05:51:10.708 --> 05:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
excruciating pain you would do exactly
 
05:51:14.190 --> 05:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
what I did and that is call 911 and get
 
05:51:17.708 --> 05:51:17.718 align:start position:0%
into whatever ambulance they sent um and
 
05:51:20.430 --> 05:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
she said yes that's true but she still
 
05:51:23.910 --> 05:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
send the check to me um and I guess I'm
 
05:51:26.390 --> 05:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
saying are you aware of these things I
 
05:51:28.510 --> 05:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
am and that's why I'm bringing this bill
 
05:51:31.548 --> 05:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
forth right because we have those
 
05:51:34.628 --> 05:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
patients that I work for eping fire
 
05:51:34.638 --> 05:51:35.628 align:start position:0%
patients that I work for eping fire
perfect

05:51:35.628 --> 05:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
05:51:38.430 --> 05:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
disclusion um and we have those people
 
05:51:39.948 --> 05:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
call us all the time hey I got this
 
05:51:41.350 --> 05:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
check it has your name on it I don't
 
05:51:43.390 --> 05:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
know what to do with it where do I where
 
05:51:44.788 --> 05:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
do I send this and we have to give them
 
05:51:46.350 --> 05:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
the address they have to stick in an
 
05:51:48.390 --> 05:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
envelope and send it to us when they
 
05:51:50.150 --> 05:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
have other things to worry about so yes
 
05:51:52.628 --> 05:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:55.750 --> 05:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
aware well
 
05:51:58.830 --> 05:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
when I I'm pretty sure you send a letter
 
05:52:01.070 --> 05:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
after you've done the you send a letter
 
05:52:02.750 --> 05:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
to the patient and tell them that when
 
05:52:05.350 --> 05:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
they do get that check ahead of time
 
05:52:07.190 --> 05:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
because I I certainly know that Peter
 
05:52:10.230 --> 05:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
bro does that I don't believe we do okay
 
05:52:14.030 --> 05:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
because I know Peter bro does yeah okay
 
05:52:15.628 --> 05:52:15.638 align:start position:0%
repres I was wondering if you could
 
05:52:18.110 --> 05:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
answer a question I know that there's a
 
05:52:19.628 --> 05:52:19.638 align:start position:0%
I guess it's a study committee that was
 
05:52:22.270 --> 05:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
formed by is formed by um commissioner
 
05:52:24.868 --> 05:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
beton court and who said that this is
 
05:52:26.830 --> 05:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
not a legislative issue so I'm wondering
 
05:52:30.390 --> 05:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
how this ties in with I believe Senators
 
05:52:32.468 --> 05:52:32.478 align:start position:0%
here who is on that committee how this
 
05:52:34.270 --> 05:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
ties in with what the commissioner's
 
05:52:36.310 --> 05:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
doing so unfortunately I wasn't able to
 
05:52:37.510 --> 05:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
make it to that Commission because I
 
05:52:39.150 --> 05:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
would have tried to have dealt with it
 
05:52:40.990 --> 05:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
then I found about found out about the
 
05:52:44.190 --> 05:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
commission too late apparently but I I
 
05:52:46.990 --> 05:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
believe this is a legislative issue okay
 
05:52:48.590 --> 05:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
just to follow up he said it was not so
 
05:52:48.600 --> 05:52:49.670 align:start position:0%
just to follow up he said it was not so
I'm

05:52:49.670 --> 05:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:52:52.030 --> 05:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
confused I'm confused now
 
05:52:56.350 --> 05:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
too good so the issue of the commission
 
05:52:59.948 --> 05:52:59.958 align:start position:0%
was the reimbursement dollar
 
05:53:03.468 --> 05:53:03.478 align:start position:0%
amount the issue that that Mark bringing
 
05:53:08.070 --> 05:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
in is sort of been a side issue it to
 
05:53:09.830 --> 05:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
the overall it it certainly would be
 
05:53:11.628 --> 05:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
because it would be an overall Final
 
05:53:14.270 --> 05:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
Solution what representative BR he's
 
05:53:17.510 --> 05:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
bringing this in because the ambulance
 
05:53:19.910 --> 05:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
issue has never been solved it can
 
05:53:21.990 --> 05:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
seemingly can't solve and he was just
 
05:53:25.230 --> 05:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
saying at least can you at least just
 
05:53:29.788 --> 05:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
send us that check and and uh at at as
 
05:53:33.430 --> 05:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
as a in the meantime before the ultimate
 
05:53:35.150 --> 05:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
solution is
 
05:53:38.150 --> 05:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
solved representative
 
05:53:41.708 --> 05:53:41.718 align:start position:0%
speaker it seems very straightforward uh
 
05:53:44.230 --> 05:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
but who determines the size of the check
 
05:53:46.350 --> 05:53:46.360 align:start position:0%
I mean is it just whatever is covered in
 
05:53:48.070 --> 05:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
whatever the person's insurance policy
 
05:53:50.510 --> 05:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
is regardless of what the ambulance
 
05:53:53.150 --> 05:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
ended up spending to do it boy that's a
 
05:53:56.468 --> 05:53:56.478 align:start position:0%
whole another road to go down so they're
 
05:53:58.868 --> 05:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
going to send us an amount and whatever
 
05:53:58.878 --> 05:53:59.830 align:start position:0%
going to send us an amount and whatever
they

05:53:59.830 --> 05:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:54:02.270 --> 05:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
decide exactly and I'm not really sure
 
05:54:05.190 --> 05:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
how they decide that but they do okay
 
05:54:08.110 --> 05:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
and it's not it's usually nowhere near
 
05:54:10.708 --> 05:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
what we've requested what we've built I
 
05:54:13.590 --> 05:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
know when the oil company comes and
 
05:54:16.830 --> 05:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
drops oil in my tank they send me a bill
 
05:54:19.910 --> 05:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
for $1,000 and and I know if I said hey
 
05:54:21.708 --> 05:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
I only want to pay
 
05:54:24.110 --> 05:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
300 the next person knocking on my door
 
05:54:27.270 --> 05:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
would probably be a police officer so
 
05:54:29.230 --> 05:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
that's a whole another story okay that's
 
05:54:31.468 --> 05:54:31.478 align:start position:0%
separate from this I just want to get
 
05:54:33.150 --> 05:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
the check because like the
 
05:54:35.510 --> 05:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative said she got this check
 
05:54:37.948 --> 05:54:37.958 align:start position:0%
and she had no idea what she supposed to
 
05:54:40.510 --> 05:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
do with it and unfortunately that
 
05:54:43.350 --> 05:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
happens quite a bit I also would just
 
05:54:45.708 --> 05:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
throw in a curveball here there is two
 
05:54:47.510 --> 05:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
different kinds of checks that actually
 
05:54:50.788 --> 05:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
come up yeah and that is um you whether
 
05:54:53.468 --> 05:54:53.478 align:start position:0%
the claim was made under the med
 
05:54:57.590 --> 05:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
pay and of their auto insurance and that
 
05:54:59.868 --> 05:54:59.878 align:start position:0%
will uh theoretically could be a higher
 
05:55:02.910 --> 05:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
dollar amount and that would go to
 
05:55:05.788 --> 05:55:05.798 align:start position:0%
directly to the again to the the person
 
05:55:07.830 --> 05:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
who had the insurance but that dollar
 
05:55:10.468 --> 05:55:10.478 align:start position:0%
amount would be whatever usually what
 
05:55:13.628 --> 05:55:13.638 align:start position:0%
the uh the the ambulance build it build
 
05:55:15.910 --> 05:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
for as long as it stays under what the
 
05:55:18.590 --> 05:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
total med pay was so what just so we
 
05:55:20.670 --> 05:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
everybody know in a discussion we're not
 
05:55:22.670 --> 05:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
talking about that issue not we're
 
05:55:22.680 --> 05:55:24.070 align:start position:0%
talking about that issue not we're
talking

05:55:24.070 --> 05:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
talking
 
05:55:27.310 --> 05:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
about insurance health insurance and
 
05:55:28.868 --> 05:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
health insurance meaning that you
 
05:55:31.070 --> 05:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
weren't in your car you had your heart
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
attack or whatever inside your home your
 
05:55:35.670 --> 05:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
health insurance is picking it up and
 
05:55:37.868 --> 05:55:37.878 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies says we don't
 
05:55:40.030 --> 05:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
have a contract we don't have anything
 
05:55:43.190 --> 05:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
with this ambulance company and uh and
 
05:55:46.190 --> 05:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that that they don't
 
05:55:47.708 --> 05:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
have a dollar amount in what they have
 
05:55:50.390 --> 05:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
so they have what they believe is the
 
05:55:53.750 --> 05:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
the appropriate fee and that is what the
 
05:55:56.430 --> 05:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner is trying to
 
05:55:59.390 --> 05:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
negotiate and work out out a solution in
 
05:56:01.310 --> 05:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
terms of how that dollar amount is
 
05:56:04.230 --> 05:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
addressed and how is it really truly the
 
05:56:06.468 --> 05:56:06.478 align:start position:0%
appropriate dollar but it's still
 
05:56:08.468 --> 05:56:08.478 align:start position:0%
outside of the the fundamental issue
 
05:56:11.070 --> 05:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
which he described everybody which is
 
05:56:13.990 --> 05:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's because they don't have an
 
05:56:16.628 --> 05:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
agreement with the insurance company in
 
05:56:19.390 --> 05:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
that case if they did if they were as a
 
05:56:22.788 --> 05:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
as a provider that check would go
 
05:56:26.030 --> 05:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
directly to them but they don't have
 
05:56:28.548 --> 05:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
that contract at even a lesser amount of
 
05:56:30.868 --> 05:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
money and and of course it's what they
 
05:56:32.430 --> 05:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
decide that they think is the
 
05:56:34.350 --> 05:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount okay you've already
 
05:56:36.110 --> 05:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
had a question so
 
05:56:39.510 --> 05:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
now so what what we're talking about
 
05:56:41.510 --> 05:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
here because we've we've been dealing
 
05:56:44.030 --> 05:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
with these this ambulance stuff for the
 
05:56:46.310 --> 05:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
last several years all we're dealing
 
05:56:48.948 --> 05:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
with here is that as I understand this
 
05:56:52.430 --> 05:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
bill is that in this situation where the
 
05:56:56.868 --> 05:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
insurer has a contract with a provider
 
05:57:00.230 --> 05:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
the money goes to the provider if the
 
05:57:01.990 --> 05:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
provider is out of
 
05:57:04.788 --> 05:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
network the insurance company has the
 
05:57:07.430 --> 05:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
practice of paying whatever they're
 
05:57:10.510 --> 05:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
going to pay to the insured and not to
 
05:57:13.190 --> 05:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
the ambulance company and what this bill
 
05:57:15.788 --> 05:57:15.798 align:start position:0%
is directed to do is to have the
 
05:57:18.750 --> 05:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
insurance company send the money to the
 
05:57:21.230 --> 05:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
outof network provider whatever it is
 
05:57:23.390 --> 05:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
that they have decided to pay rather
 
05:57:25.030 --> 05:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
than to the
 
05:57:27.868 --> 05:57:27.878 align:start position:0%
insured so that in effect out of network
 
05:57:29.830 --> 05:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
work and network will be treated the
 
05:57:32.070 --> 05:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
same that's that that is my
 
05:57:33.628 --> 05:57:33.638 align:start position:0%
understanding that's that and then we
 
05:57:36.030 --> 05:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
can if everybody understands that and
 
05:57:37.948 --> 05:57:37.958 align:start position:0%
and and they're okay with that we can go
 
05:57:41.590 --> 05:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:43.910 --> 05:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
chairman has a question thank you I
 
05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
think I might have a good one here um
 
05:57:49.868 --> 05:57:49.878 align:start position:0%
what you believe uh in
 
05:57:53.628 --> 05:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
2018 there was a study uh committee
 
05:57:56.390 --> 05:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
study commission that issued a report on
 
05:57:58.830 --> 05:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
the subject it was chaired by by Lori
 
05:58:01.670 --> 05:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
sandborn uh one of the findings
 
05:58:04.510 --> 05:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
is reimbursement checks issued to both
 
05:58:06.030 --> 05:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
the insured and the provider lead to a
 
05:58:08.350 --> 05:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
number of problems it is confusing and
 
05:58:10.468 --> 05:58:10.478 align:start position:0%
inconvenient for the consumer makes it
 
05:58:11.350 --> 05:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
difficult for the provider to get
 
05:58:13.750 --> 05:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
payment Anthem does not issue checks to
 
05:58:16.190 --> 05:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
two payes and the first recommendation
 
05:58:18.990 --> 05:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
of the report is delete the phrase or
 
05:58:21.230 --> 05:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
buy a check payable to the insured and
 
05:58:22.830 --> 05:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
the ambulance service provider from the
 
05:58:24.990 --> 05:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
first sentence of so the first
 
05:58:26.430 --> 05:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation of this report is your
 
05:58:30.708 --> 05:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
bill so would you you believe yes yes I
 
05:58:32.948 --> 05:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
would and I'm surprised I have to be
 
05:58:32.958 --> 05:58:35.310 align:start position:0%
would and I'm surprised I have to be
here

05:58:35.310 --> 05:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:38.590 --> 05:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
again okay representative Gibbs has
 
05:58:41.190 --> 05:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you uh this is another would you
 
05:58:43.510 --> 05:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
believe I'm afraid would you believe
 
05:58:46.390 --> 05:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
that for conquered patients dealing with
 
05:58:48.990 --> 05:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
Anthem nobody sends a letter to the
 
05:58:51.548 --> 05:58:51.558 align:start position:0%
patient right about how the money is
 
05:58:54.390 --> 05:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
going to be paid the check just re just
 
05:58:56.750 --> 05:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
appears in the mail with no explanation
 
05:59:00.190 --> 05:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
at all as to why you're getting it or
 
05:59:02.230 --> 05:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes even who the ambulance company
 
05:59:04.390 --> 05:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
was that you're supposed to send it to
 
05:59:07.070 --> 05:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
so you have no idea what to do with it
 
05:59:09.788 --> 05:59:09.798 align:start position:0%
correct which is troublesome for
 
05:59:12.708 --> 05:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
patients who are having issues already
 
05:59:14.190 --> 05:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
you know because they needed an
 
05:59:15.708 --> 05:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
ambulance and now they have to deal with
 
05:59:19.110 --> 05:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
this which we don't think is fair on a
 
05:59:21.390 --> 05:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
number of
 
05:59:24.948 --> 05:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
reasons and we all set thank you very
 
05:59:38.070 --> 05:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:48.230 --> 05:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:50.670 --> 05:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
croll is this it for health insurance
 
05:59:54.110 --> 05:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
mandate day or do I have another
 
05:59:56.350 --> 05:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
one no we have another we have another
 
05:59:58.030 --> 05:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
Insurance day don't we yeah I think we
 
06:00:04.310 --> 06:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:07.070 --> 06:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon Mr chairman members
 
06:00:08.390 --> 06:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee again for the record my
 
06:00:10.150 --> 06:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
name is Heidi croll I work at Gallagher
 
06:00:11.788 --> 06:00:11.798 align:start position:0%
Callahan and gartell and I'm here today
 
06:00:13.390 --> 06:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
on behalf of ahip which is America's
 
06:00:16.110 --> 06:00:16.120 align:start position:0%
health insurance plans
 
06:00:19.230 --> 06:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
um this bill is one that you've seen um
 
06:00:22.868 --> 06:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
many times before
 
06:00:26.310 --> 06:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
um I've participated in the uh uh
 
06:00:28.110 --> 06:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholder processes and study
 
06:00:30.230 --> 06:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
committees along the way um including
 
06:00:32.590 --> 06:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
the one that was um convened by the
 
06:00:34.948 --> 06:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
insurance department uh at the end of
 
06:00:37.590 --> 06:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
last session and numerous stakeholder um
 
06:00:41.070 --> 06:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
meetings were held um and I think you
 
06:00:42.548 --> 06:00:42.558 align:start position:0%
know we're kind of at the point where we
 
06:00:44.750 --> 06:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
tried to come to resolution um and I
 
06:00:47.750 --> 06:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
think at this point without success uh
 
06:00:50.868 --> 06:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
on on that on that effort um not for
 
06:00:53.110 --> 06:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
lack of um trying I think people you
 
06:00:55.788 --> 06:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
know uh learned a lot of information
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
shared uh their thoughts and opinions
 
06:01:00.030 --> 06:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
and I I think people learned a lot but
 
06:01:03.510 --> 06:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't come to a resolution
 
06:01:06.070 --> 06:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
um as you've heard I mean again
 
06:01:08.670 --> 06:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
obviously this is a policy decision but
 
06:01:11.270 --> 06:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
um when the ambulance providers are out
 
06:01:13.948 --> 06:01:13.958 align:start position:0%
of network sending the check to the
 
06:01:16.190 --> 06:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
patient is the only leverage that the
 
06:01:19.510 --> 06:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
carrier has to try to get the carrier to
 
06:01:22.230 --> 06:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
to try to get the provider to come into
 
06:01:22.240 --> 06:01:23.868 align:start position:0%
to try to get the provider to come into
Network

06:01:23.868 --> 06:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
Network
 
06:01:27.990 --> 06:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
um and the tug and pull here is is that
 
06:01:30.670 --> 06:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
um when a provider an ambulance provider
 
06:01:33.310 --> 06:01:33.320 align:start position:0%
is out of network um they are allowed to
 
06:01:37.708 --> 06:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
balance bill um and so anything you know
 
06:01:39.190 --> 06:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
they have their full charge and whatever
 
06:01:41.468 --> 06:01:41.478 align:start position:0%
is not covered by the insurance um
 
06:01:44.548 --> 06:01:44.558 align:start position:0%
company is balance Bill to the patient
 
06:01:48.230 --> 06:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
um there was mention of uh for an outof
 
06:01:50.910 --> 06:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
Network doctors um that they do get a
 
06:01:53.788 --> 06:01:53.798 align:start position:0%
check directly that's negotiated um
 
06:01:56.548 --> 06:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
between the outof network doctor and the
 
06:01:58.670 --> 06:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
carrier and the difference is that under
 
06:02:01.430 --> 06:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
the no surprises act the doctors are not
 
06:02:05.310 --> 06:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to balance bill um so that is a
 
06:02:08.990 --> 06:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think an important distinction um and
 
06:02:12.070 --> 06:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
of course balance billing is um you know
 
06:02:15.150 --> 06:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
harmful to to client to to patients um
 
06:02:16.910 --> 06:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
and we've had a balance you know we've
 
06:02:18.468 --> 06:02:18.478 align:start position:0%
got our own New Hampshire statute on the
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
book for a while around balance billing
 
06:02:22.350 --> 06:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
no balance billing um but ambulance
 
06:02:24.110 --> 06:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
providers you know have not been part of
 
06:02:24.120 --> 06:02:26.350 align:start position:0%
providers you know have not been part of
that

06:02:26.350 --> 06:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:02:28.708 --> 06:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
um so I think you know I would just
 
06:02:30.430 --> 06:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
leave it at that it's it's really and
 
06:02:31.948 --> 06:02:31.958 align:start position:0%
the final thing I guess I would say is
 
06:02:33.548 --> 06:02:33.558 align:start position:0%
that when the check does go to the
 
06:02:37.270 --> 06:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
patient um in part it's that's the only
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship that the
 
06:02:40.590 --> 06:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
carrier has it's the contractual
 
06:02:43.110 --> 06:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
relationship with the patient um and not
 
06:02:45.628 --> 06:02:45.638 align:start position:0%
with in this case not with the ambulance
 
06:02:48.070 --> 06:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
provider so
 
06:02:50.350 --> 06:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
um I'll leave it at that happy to answer
 
06:02:51.708 --> 06:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
any questions but I know it's late in
 
06:02:52.948 --> 06:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
the day and there are other people who
 
06:02:54.628 --> 06:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
would like to speak as
 
06:02:57.590 --> 06:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
well okay so does everybody understand
 
06:03:01.230 --> 06:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
that the difference between you and a uh
 
06:03:04.070 --> 06:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
the anesthesiologist who didn't have is
 
06:03:08.190 --> 06:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
not in network is that they do pay the
 
06:03:10.910 --> 06:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist directly because the
 
06:03:14.708 --> 06:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist promises not to balance
 
06:03:14.718 --> 06:03:16.548 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist promises not to balance
bill

06:03:16.548 --> 06:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:03:19.868 --> 06:03:19.878 align:start position:0%
so so if you're willing to promise not
 
06:03:22.830 --> 06:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
to balance bill then they'll send you a
 
06:03:26.110 --> 06:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
check promise toay what we
 
06:03:29.350 --> 06:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
s right but that's the same issue with
 
06:03:32.868 --> 06:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
the NZ cist the enologist sends out a
 
06:03:36.070 --> 06:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
big fat Bill and they say we're not
 
06:03:37.750 --> 06:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
going to pay that big fat Bill we're
 
06:03:42.548 --> 06:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:45.548 --> 06:03:45.558 align:start position:0%
one that's correct your service is
 
06:03:47.788 --> 06:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
totally different that is correct did
 
06:03:50.510 --> 06:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
you do something that nobody else is
 
06:03:52.390 --> 06:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
which is that we got to pay for you to
 
06:03:56.190 --> 06:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
be Stand By and that's the
 
06:03:56.200 --> 06:03:59.190 align:start position:0%
be Stand By and that's the
problem

06:03:59.190 --> 06:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:04:01.390 --> 06:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
that's that no doubt that is the the
 
06:04:03.468 --> 06:04:03.478 align:start position:0%
heart of the problem is that that we're
 
06:04:06.468 --> 06:04:06.478 align:start position:0%
paying for you to be there not not be
 
06:04:08.070 --> 06:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
you know to be on
 
06:04:12.270 --> 06:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
call and I'm sure you I've never heard
 
06:04:15.030 --> 06:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
anybody complain about any that's true
 
06:04:18.190 --> 06:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
except we did have problem in Kean for a
 
06:04:21.548 --> 06:04:21.558 align:start position:0%
while okay yeah thank you for taking my
 
06:04:23.910 --> 06:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
question how difficult would it be to
 
06:04:26.750 --> 06:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
send that same check the same amount
 
06:04:29.070 --> 06:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
that you send to the patient to the
 
06:04:32.830 --> 06:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
person or the or the the ambulance uh
 
06:04:35.110 --> 06:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
company that provides the service
 
06:04:38.030 --> 06:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
service why how is that so difficult to
 
06:04:41.628 --> 06:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
do or why I don't think it's an issue of
 
06:04:44.230 --> 06:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
being it's difficult that we know we
 
06:04:46.030 --> 06:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
know that the ambulance is going to send
 
06:04:48.230 --> 06:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
a bill they're out of network they're
 
06:04:51.150 --> 06:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
going to send a bill to the patient and
 
06:04:53.628 --> 06:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
the carrier has given the patient
 
06:04:54.990 --> 06:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
because that's who the contractual
 
06:04:57.830 --> 06:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
Arrangement is with the carer has given
 
06:05:00.628 --> 06:05:00.638 align:start position:0%
the patient the reimbursement that they
 
06:05:02.390 --> 06:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
would you know standard reimbursement
 
06:05:05.430 --> 06:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
for the service the part with what they
 
06:05:08.910 --> 06:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
would have given if the
 
06:05:12.150 --> 06:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
fire accepted so the idea is that the
 
06:05:13.230 --> 06:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
06:05:16.430 --> 06:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
$1,000 and and the insurance company's
 
06:05:19.548 --> 06:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
paying 750 instead of paying the 750 to
 
06:05:21.628 --> 06:05:21.638 align:start position:0%
the ambulance directly they sending the
 
06:05:24.510 --> 06:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
750 to the patient because they know the
 
06:05:26.670 --> 06:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
patient has got to write that thousand
 
06:05:28.590 --> 06:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
check to the
 
06:05:31.270 --> 06:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
ambulance the the the the provider would
 
06:05:33.910 --> 06:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
be paid directly if they are in network
 
06:05:36.708 --> 06:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
and I know that you know there are
 
06:05:39.390 --> 06:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers who are in network
 
06:05:43.230 --> 06:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
um but not not of them certainly not
 
06:05:46.830 --> 06:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
municipal fire departments just a just
 
06:05:51.070 --> 06:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
to follow up could could you um send a a
 
06:05:54.230 --> 06:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
notice with the check to the patient
 
06:05:57.670 --> 06:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
that they need to send this check to the
 
06:05:57.680 --> 06:05:59.350 align:start position:0%
that they need to send this check to the
ambulance

06:05:59.350 --> 06:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
06:06:01.628 --> 06:06:01.638 align:start position:0%
service I can check with I I can check
 
06:06:02.910 --> 06:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
with the carriers I don't know what
 
06:06:05.190 --> 06:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
their Protocols are um but no that's
 
06:06:08.830 --> 06:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:08.840 --> 06:06:10.750 align:start position:0%
 
yep

06:06:10.750 --> 06:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
yep
 
06:06:14.990 --> 06:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
y That's excuse me isn't it typical when
 
06:06:17.070 --> 06:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
a health insurance company makes a
 
06:06:20.468 --> 06:06:20.478 align:start position:0%
payment that they uh that that they
 
06:06:22.430 --> 06:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
describe what they're paying
 
06:06:24.590 --> 06:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
for you know you get you get a check
 
06:06:27.670 --> 06:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
stub or an EOB right typically with
 
06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
insurance and says this is what we're
 
06:06:32.670 --> 06:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
paying for so so you you don't I I've
 
06:06:34.230 --> 06:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
never had this happen so when you send
 
06:06:38.150 --> 06:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
out a check to to a policy
 
06:06:41.350 --> 06:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
holder for an ambulance service that's
 
06:06:43.190 --> 06:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
been provided by an out of network
 
06:06:46.230 --> 06:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
provider you don't include an EOB
 
06:06:48.350 --> 06:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
explaining what the check is you just
 
06:06:51.788 --> 06:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
send a check that says made out to John
 
06:06:52.788 --> 06:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
Smith for
 
06:06:55.150 --> 06:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
$424 and the person and and John Smith
 
06:06:56.948 --> 06:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
has no idea why you got a check for $4
 
06:06:58.990 --> 06:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
$24 I'm just trying to understand this
 
06:07:00.670 --> 06:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
I've never had this occur in my life
 
06:07:02.110 --> 06:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
before I would have to check with the
 
06:07:04.270 --> 06:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
carriers you know ahip is an association
 
06:07:06.030 --> 06:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
so I don't know individual we have to
 
06:07:08.590 --> 06:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
ask Insurance comp we do have Anthem so
 
06:07:11.310 --> 06:07:11.320 align:start position:0%
you can ask Anthem that
 
06:07:14.190 --> 06:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
question yes no yes yeah would you
 
06:07:17.708 --> 06:07:17.718 align:start position:0%
believe that if you had mortgage or rent
 
06:07:20.230 --> 06:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
payment due and you had no money what
 
06:07:21.548 --> 06:07:21.558 align:start position:0%
are you going to do with the check I
 
06:07:23.310 --> 06:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
mean and I'm not I'm not condemning it I
 
06:07:24.990 --> 06:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
mean if you you have a choice between
 
06:07:27.070 --> 06:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
paying your rent and not and you get get
 
06:07:28.430 --> 06:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
this check you're going to use it well
 
06:07:30.350 --> 06:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
that's a related issue but it's not the
 
06:07:31.910 --> 06:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
same it's not the same question
 
06:07:31.920 --> 06:07:33.708 align:start position:0%
same it's not the same question
representative

06:07:33.708 --> 06:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:07:36.868 --> 06:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you and I I'm going to
 
06:07:38.590 --> 06:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
apologize Upfront for the way I'm going
 
06:07:40.190 --> 06:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
to put this because I just don't know
 
06:07:42.868 --> 06:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
how else to put it and I speak here from
 
06:07:45.110 --> 06:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
personal experience where I've been
 
06:07:49.030 --> 06:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
driven crazy several times and you said
 
06:07:52.150 --> 06:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
that the reason that the in insurance
 
06:07:54.510 --> 06:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
companies send the check to the patient
 
06:07:57.030 --> 06:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
is because that's the only way they
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
leverage over the ambulance companies to
 
06:08:01.230 --> 06:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
try to get the ambulance companies to
 
06:08:04.070 --> 06:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
come in in network
 
06:08:07.548 --> 06:08:07.558 align:start position:0%
so it's okay with the insurance company
 
06:08:10.468 --> 06:08:10.478 align:start position:0%
it's okay with you that you drive the
 
06:08:12.948 --> 06:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies Drive the
 
06:08:15.430 --> 06:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
patient crazy in order for the insurance
 
06:08:16.990 --> 06:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
companies to get leverage over the
 
06:08:19.110 --> 06:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies which the patient
 
06:08:21.948 --> 06:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
has absolutely no control over
 
06:08:21.958 --> 06:08:25.190 align:start position:0%
has absolutely no control over
whatsoever

06:08:25.190 --> 06:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:28.030 --> 06:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
question so I I I don't think the
 
06:08:29.468 --> 06:08:29.478 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are trying to
 
06:08:31.270 --> 06:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
intentionally Drive their their members
 
06:08:33.510 --> 06:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
crazy I don't they don't think member um
 
06:08:35.910 --> 06:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
customer service is important to them so
 
06:08:38.270 --> 06:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
um we know how those mental mental
 
06:08:41.390 --> 06:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
health benefits I would how high they
 
06:08:44.788 --> 06:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
pay I would say if there are ways to
 
06:08:47.510 --> 06:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
improve the co uh communication and the
 
06:08:49.990 --> 06:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
correspondence um between the carrier
 
06:08:52.708 --> 06:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
and the patient um when that check
 
06:08:55.510 --> 06:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
arrives um I'm not familiar with what
 
06:08:57.548 --> 06:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
that looks like but if there's a way to
 
06:08:59.230 --> 06:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
improve that communication so that it is
 
06:09:02.750 --> 06:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
clear um I think we'd be open to you
 
06:09:05.750 --> 06:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
know talking about that thank you very
 
06:09:09.030 --> 06:09:09.040 align:start position:0%

06:09:21.868 --> 06:09:21.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:24.110 --> 06:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:09:26.030 --> 06:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
committee I won't I have a whole long
 
06:09:27.750 --> 06:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
letter here but I won't won't read it
 
06:09:31.150 --> 06:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
because I know the day is late and
 
06:09:33.708 --> 06:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
um things but but I what what I do want
 
06:09:35.430 --> 06:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
to say is my name is Michael sear I'm
 
06:09:36.948 --> 06:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
the fire chief of the Tilton Northfield
 
06:09:39.110 --> 06:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
fire district so I'm the chief of Tilton
 
06:09:41.750 --> 06:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
and Northfield and I'm representing the
 
06:09:43.310 --> 06:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of Fire Chiefs
 
06:09:46.628 --> 06:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
and supported this bill um I'll cut
 
06:09:49.548 --> 06:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
right to the chase on this my currently
 
06:09:51.990 --> 06:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
my department is not in network with any
 
06:09:55.628 --> 06:09:55.638 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers over the past year my
 
06:09:58.468 --> 06:09:58.478 align:start position:0%
department received 164 claims directly
 
06:10:00.990 --> 06:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
paid from carriers with which our
 
06:10:02.830 --> 06:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
department is not in
 
06:10:06.350 --> 06:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
network at the same time we have had to
 
06:10:10.070 --> 06:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
attempt to recover 29 claims totaling $
 
06:10:10.080 --> 06:10:11.910 align:start position:0%
attempt to recover 29 claims totaling $
43,2

06:10:11.910 --> 06:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
43,2
 
06:10:14.628 --> 06:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
something5 are averaging
 
06:10:18.070 --> 06:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
$1,492 each from individuals who have
 
06:10:20.590 --> 06:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
received checks directly from the
 
06:10:22.990 --> 06:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
carriers ambulance providers do not need
 
06:10:25.390 --> 06:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
to be in network to receive payments it
 
06:10:27.310 --> 06:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
happens in our department routin rely so
 
06:10:30.788 --> 06:10:30.798 align:start position:0%
we do receive checks from directly from
 
06:10:33.910 --> 06:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
pay uh carriers all the
 
06:10:36.590 --> 06:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
time there are many times where we just
 
06:10:39.110 --> 06:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't and then the bill goes I mean the
 
06:10:42.270 --> 06:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
check goes to the patient and then they
 
06:10:44.070 --> 06:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
end up getting a bill from
 
06:10:48.628 --> 06:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
us and if they can't resolve that issue
 
06:10:50.750 --> 06:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
they end up going through a process and
 
06:10:53.788 --> 06:10:53.798 align:start position:0%
you know we have uh checks and balances
 
06:10:55.548 --> 06:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
in place if they're if they're a
 
06:10:57.788 --> 06:10:57.798 align:start position:0%
hardship case they can apply for a
 
06:10:59.990 --> 06:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
hardship and we'll wave the bill many
 
06:11:02.910 --> 06:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
times that's what happens but so we do
 
06:11:04.868 --> 06:11:04.878 align:start position:0%
have a process and we don't take people
 
06:11:07.708 --> 06:11:07.718 align:start position:0%
to send people the collections every
 
06:11:10.670 --> 06:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
time that something like this happens so
 
06:11:13.468 --> 06:11:13.478 align:start position:0%
uh we're very sensitive to that so I
 
06:11:15.468 --> 06:11:15.478 align:start position:0%
would suggest that just changing the
 
06:11:18.150 --> 06:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
language in this bill would solve the
 
06:11:20.708 --> 06:11:20.718 align:start position:0%
problem and make everything easier for
 
06:11:22.910 --> 06:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
everybody because uh even in my own
 
06:11:25.708 --> 06:11:25.718 align:start position:0%
department where my own members who have
 
06:11:27.868 --> 06:11:27.878 align:start position:0%
insurance have used an ambulance in
 
06:11:31.270 --> 06:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
their own Community where they live and
 
06:11:32.708 --> 06:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
they have to go through this issue where
 
06:11:34.310 --> 06:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
they're calling their insurance company
 
06:11:37.430 --> 06:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
say Hey you sent me the check and now
 
06:11:39.830 --> 06:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
I'm getting a bill from the town that I
 
06:11:42.628 --> 06:11:42.638 align:start position:0%
live in that I ow that money why didn't
 
06:11:45.150 --> 06:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
you send it to them and it's a process
 
06:11:47.110 --> 06:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
but then when I deal with residents
 
06:11:49.868 --> 06:11:49.878 align:start position:0%
within my own Community especially um
 
06:11:52.270 --> 06:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
elderly people who are really not aware
 
06:11:55.070 --> 06:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
of how the whole system works it's very
 
06:11:56.990 --> 06:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
confusing for them trying to get a hold
 
06:11:59.430 --> 06:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
of the insurance company on the phone is
 
06:12:00.948 --> 06:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
practically damn near impossible I'm
 
06:12:02.430 --> 06:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
sure you've all tried to do it and you
 
06:12:06.708 --> 06:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
get on hold and you're there forever so
 
06:12:09.070 --> 06:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
it's very frustrating for the customer
 
06:12:10.390 --> 06:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's frustrating for the fire
 
06:12:12.270 --> 06:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
departments that are providing the
 
06:12:13.910 --> 06:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
service just trying to recover some of
 
06:12:17.350 --> 06:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
the costs incurred providing the service
 
06:12:19.788 --> 06:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
because what we don't recover ends up
 
06:12:21.390 --> 06:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
going on the tax rate because we're
 
06:12:23.350 --> 06:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
still going to provide the service that
 
06:12:27.110 --> 06:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
the residents of the community uh expect
 
06:12:29.628 --> 06:12:29.638 align:start position:0%
so um I think that's enough for now I
 
06:12:31.070 --> 06:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
Happ to answer any questions
 
06:12:32.910 --> 06:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
representative Terry so I we just want
 
06:12:36.230 --> 06:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
to be clear here with respect to uh your
 
06:12:39.590 --> 06:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
billing of the the the person for whom
 
06:12:42.830 --> 06:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
you provided the service this person in
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
this instance in which I'm citing
 
06:12:45.910 --> 06:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
receives a
 
06:12:49.708 --> 06:12:49.718 align:start position:0%
check from the insurance carrier for X
 
06:12:52.390 --> 06:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
number of dollars you're out out of
 
06:12:53.990 --> 06:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
network provider so that's why you
 
06:12:56.468 --> 06:12:56.478 align:start position:0%
didn't get anything you bill for the
 
06:12:59.590 --> 06:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
total amount of your service to the
 
06:13:02.270 --> 06:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
person who you provided the service for
 
06:13:06.510 --> 06:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
who received a check from his or her
 
06:13:09.390 --> 06:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
insurer and there are instances in which
 
06:13:13.110 --> 06:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
you get nothing from the the person for
 
06:13:15.548 --> 06:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
whom you uh provided the service or
 
06:13:18.030 --> 06:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
you're only getting an amount that's
 
06:13:19.990 --> 06:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
equal to the amount of the check was
 
06:13:22.230 --> 06:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
provided how can you can you can you
 
06:13:24.390 --> 06:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
break that down for us because I can I
 
06:13:25.868 --> 06:13:25.878 align:start position:0%
can foresee a situation where somebody
 
06:13:27.590 --> 06:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
gets a check and then they just decide
 
06:13:29.670 --> 06:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
they're just not going to pay anything
 
06:13:31.510 --> 06:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
now is that is that are you describing
 
06:13:33.948 --> 06:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
situations like that to us yes we have
 
06:13:37.350 --> 06:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
situations like that um unfortunately we
 
06:13:40.948 --> 06:13:40.958 align:start position:0%
have some um people within my community
 
06:13:43.670 --> 06:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
that call for the ambulance on a regular
 
06:13:46.788 --> 06:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
basis and they have insurance they get a
 
06:13:50.150 --> 06:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
check and they don't send the check to
 
06:13:51.990 --> 06:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
the fire department they actually use
 
06:13:54.310 --> 06:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
that as part of their income in my opin
 
06:13:56.070 --> 06:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion that's what it seems
 
06:13:56.080 --> 06:13:57.750 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion that's what it seems
like

06:13:57.750 --> 06:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:13:57.760 --> 06:14:00.150 align:start position:0%
like
you're

06:14:00.150 --> 06:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:01.990 --> 06:14:02.000 align:start position:0%

06:14:23.830 --> 06:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
two hello chairman hunt and members of
 
06:14:25.190 --> 06:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for the
 
06:14:26.670 --> 06:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify my name is
 
06:14:28.110 --> 06:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
Sabrina Dunlap I'm director of
 
06:14:30.548 --> 06:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
government relations for Anthem I know
 
06:14:33.628 --> 06:14:33.638 align:start position:0%
it is very late and as uh chairman hunt
 
06:14:35.708 --> 06:14:35.718 align:start position:0%
knows I I can talk a lot about ambulance
 
06:14:38.110 --> 06:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
we have been talking about this for a
 
06:14:40.708 --> 06:14:40.718 align:start position:0%
long time years but in fact since about
 
06:14:42.030 --> 06:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
last year when you all had a bill in
 
06:14:43.708 --> 06:14:43.718 align:start position:0%
front of you very similar to this we did
 
06:14:46.070 --> 06:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
have I had my own meetings um with
 
06:14:47.390 --> 06:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers and then the
 
06:14:49.350 --> 06:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
insurance department organized meetings
 
06:14:51.750 --> 06:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
and I will say you know I think everyone
 
06:14:54.350 --> 06:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
was at the table in good faith these
 
06:14:56.310 --> 06:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
issues are complicated in part because
 
06:14:57.868 --> 06:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
you're talking about some private
 
06:14:59.708 --> 06:14:59.718 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers and then a whole lot
 
06:15:02.468 --> 06:15:02.478 align:start position:0%
of municipalities I'm involved in my
 
06:15:04.750 --> 06:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
little Town's local government so I
 
06:15:06.708 --> 06:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
totally understand the complexities that
 
06:15:09.030 --> 06:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
go into ambulance and running it and it
 
06:15:11.270 --> 06:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
gets complicated when you know my town
 
06:15:13.510 --> 06:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
has decided that we're going to pay for
 
06:15:16.070 --> 06:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
247 ambulance and that costs a lot of
 
06:15:18.110 --> 06:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
money and the town does get money from
 
06:15:19.990 --> 06:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
insurance companies but part of it does
 
06:15:21.310 --> 06:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
fall to the taxpayers so it's like a
 
06:15:23.150 --> 06:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
whole another ball of wax that's
 
06:15:24.910 --> 06:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
involved with this issue that we don't
 
06:15:27.230 --> 06:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
have with other parts of healthcare
 
06:15:29.230 --> 06:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
um I will also just say that you know
 
06:15:30.990 --> 06:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
the focus has been on Commercial
 
06:15:33.708 --> 06:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
Insurance but a very significant number
 
06:15:36.270 --> 06:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
of of people in the realm of ambulance
 
06:15:39.110 --> 06:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
are have Medicare and Medicaid um so I
 
06:15:40.910 --> 06:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
don't think the focus on commercial
 
06:15:42.990 --> 06:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
insurance is going to like solve the
 
06:15:46.350 --> 06:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
problem um so I'm I'm happy to talk
 
06:15:47.708 --> 06:15:47.718 align:start position:0%
offline more about this I just want to
 
06:15:49.948 --> 06:15:49.958 align:start position:0%
make a few other points Anthem does have
 
06:15:51.430 --> 06:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
a significant number of ambulance
 
06:15:53.548 --> 06:15:53.558 align:start position:0%
providers in network both private
 
06:15:57.628 --> 06:15:57.638 align:start position:0%
companies and municipalities um um and I
 
06:15:59.310 --> 06:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
think the key difference that's been
 
06:16:02.430 --> 06:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned is balance billing so what
 
06:16:04.990 --> 06:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
happens if a provider is out of network
 
06:16:06.868 --> 06:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
we have no contractual relationship with
 
06:16:09.510 --> 06:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
them none whatsoever and so they send
 
06:16:10.708 --> 06:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to use big numbers
 
06:16:13.030 --> 06:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
because keep the math easy they send us
 
06:16:14.868 --> 06:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
a bill for $10,000 they're out of
 
06:16:16.948 --> 06:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
network we say the allowed amount is
 
06:16:19.868 --> 06:16:19.878 align:start position:0%
$5,000 we pay them the allowed amount in
 
06:16:22.708 --> 06:16:22.718 align:start position:0%
many cases the member then gets the
 
06:16:24.310 --> 06:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
balance bill of
 
06:16:26.708 --> 06:16:26.718 align:start position:0%
$5,000 that's because ground ambulance
 
06:16:28.948 --> 06:16:28.958 align:start position:0%
was excluded from the no surprises act
 
06:16:31.990 --> 06:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
which prohibits balance billing so so
 
06:16:36.990 --> 06:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
that is the key issue um and you know it
 
06:16:39.590 --> 06:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
is it does seem sort of silly I I can
 
06:16:41.270 --> 06:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
understand you know this notion of like
 
06:16:43.390 --> 06:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
why send the check to the member but the
 
06:16:44.628 --> 06:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
fact is we have a contractual
 
06:16:46.310 --> 06:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
relationship with the member we don't
 
06:16:48.468 --> 06:16:48.478 align:start position:0%
with out of network providers and the
 
06:16:50.230 --> 06:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
goal is to get them in network and I I
 
06:16:52.150 --> 06:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
think you know we are we continue to
 
06:16:53.750 --> 06:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
have these conversations we're coming to
 
06:16:55.390 --> 06:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
the table in good faith there was a
 
06:16:57.990 --> 06:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
comment about not knowing why insurance
 
06:16:59.990 --> 06:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
companies pay what we pay well during
 
06:17:01.230 --> 06:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
those many meetings with the insurance
 
06:17:03.270 --> 06:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
department it wasn't totally clear to
 
06:17:04.990 --> 06:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
many of us how the ambulance companies
 
06:17:06.990 --> 06:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
come up with what they what they charge
 
06:17:09.110 --> 06:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
so um I think these are complicated
 
06:17:11.590 --> 06:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
issues again happy to take questions
 
06:17:13.628 --> 06:17:13.638 align:start position:0%
happy to talk more about this um but I
 
06:17:15.030 --> 06:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
will say I think everyone has come to
 
06:17:17.230 --> 06:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
the table in good faith I don't think
 
06:17:19.590 --> 06:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
this bill striking that language solves
 
06:17:22.110 --> 06:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
a problem thank you very
 
06:17:24.868 --> 06:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
much representative AMT thank you Mr
 
06:17:26.030 --> 06:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking our question
 
06:17:29.708 --> 06:17:29.718 align:start position:0%
questions just so I understand uh what's
 
06:17:31.830 --> 06:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
the process involved in getting an
 
06:17:34.110 --> 06:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance provider to come into Network
 
06:17:36.708 --> 06:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
why is that such a why why might they be
 
06:17:39.070 --> 06:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
resistant to that thank you for the
 
06:17:41.110 --> 06:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
question so my understanding is first of
 
06:17:43.150 --> 06:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
all I think it's made more complicated
 
06:17:45.590 --> 06:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
because we have so many towns that have
 
06:17:47.868 --> 06:17:47.878 align:start position:0%
their own little ambulance company or
 
06:17:49.030 --> 06:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know they run their own ambulance
 
06:17:49.990 --> 06:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
and so you're talking about
 
06:17:53.110 --> 06:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities and private companies um
 
06:17:55.510 --> 06:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
the process is the same that we use with
 
06:17:57.548 --> 06:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
other providers where you know there's
 
06:17:59.350 --> 06:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
Outreach made you come to the table and
 
06:18:01.830 --> 06:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
you negotiate in good faith and I'd say
 
06:18:03.670 --> 06:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
both sides have to give a little on that
 
06:18:05.750 --> 06:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm not on the Contracting team so I
 
06:18:07.468 --> 06:18:07.478 align:start position:0%
don't know all the details but generally
 
06:18:09.270 --> 06:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
it's you know two parties coming to the
 
06:18:11.310 --> 06:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
table to negotiate what they think is a
 
06:18:13.030 --> 06:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
fair price and then once the providers
 
06:18:15.230 --> 06:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
in network they know what they're going
 
06:18:17.190 --> 06:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:18:22.350 --> 06:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
paid yeah well given that I know have a
 
06:18:25.270 --> 06:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
County uh Ambulance Service in which I'm
 
06:18:27.510 --> 06:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
sit on the fight finance committee and
 
06:18:31.150 --> 06:18:31.160 align:start position:0%
um my take uh where what the problem is
 
06:18:32.390 --> 06:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
and it was a little bit of what we
 
06:18:34.788 --> 06:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
talked about just before which is that
 
06:18:36.788 --> 06:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
when it comes to health care services
 
06:18:38.590 --> 06:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
that that it's by appointment and
 
06:18:40.350 --> 06:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
they'll take you when they're going to
 
06:18:43.390 --> 06:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
take you and the problem is is that our
 
06:18:45.190 --> 06:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance services are
 
06:18:49.468 --> 06:18:49.478 align:start position:0%
247 and so now we have a cost analysis
 
06:18:51.590 --> 06:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
problem to you know you want to have
 
06:18:53.910 --> 06:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
that ambulance available all the time
 
06:18:57.230 --> 06:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
but the reality is they can't Bill like
 
06:19:00.190 --> 06:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
we normally do in terms of healthcare or
 
06:19:02.510 --> 06:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
on a per hourly per
 
06:19:06.350 --> 06:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
service case and that's the discrepancy
 
06:19:07.830 --> 06:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
and if I could that reminds me of one
 
06:19:10.070 --> 06:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
other thing one other issue that came up
 
06:19:11.948 --> 06:19:11.958 align:start position:0%
during those meetings was this issue of
 
06:19:13.990 --> 06:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
treat no transport and there were
 
06:19:15.590 --> 06:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
comments made that carriers don't cover
 
06:19:17.030 --> 06:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
treat no transport which is where the
 
06:19:18.788 --> 06:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
ambulance shows up they don't transport
 
06:19:20.830 --> 06:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
the patient what we discovered was at
 
06:19:22.990 --> 06:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
least Anthem we do have codes for treat
 
06:19:25.910 --> 06:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
no transport but they were very rarely
 
06:19:27.110 --> 06:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
used and so this was part of the
 
06:19:28.788 --> 06:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
discussion it's it's like the nature of
 
06:19:31.190 --> 06:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance makes it difficult in many
 
06:19:34.190 --> 06:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
cases to get someone's insurance info
 
06:19:36.110 --> 06:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
and you know build that and get paid for
 
06:19:37.910 --> 06:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
that service so that's an issue where
 
06:19:39.430 --> 06:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
like I don't know what the answer is we
 
06:19:41.430 --> 06:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
cover it there's a code for it so I
 
06:19:42.590 --> 06:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
think there's probably an education
 
06:19:44.670 --> 06:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
piece on that but there's also just you
 
06:19:46.868 --> 06:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
know it's just Complicated by
 
06:19:50.350 --> 06:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
Nature great thank you thank you very
 
06:19:54.750 --> 06:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:54.760 --> 06:20:02.310 align:start position:0%
 
Chris

06:20:02.310 --> 06:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:04.270 --> 06:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon it's very rare that I get
 
06:20:05.990 --> 06:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
the last word and since I'm going home
 
06:20:07.788 --> 06:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
this is gonna be great I won't get it
 
06:20:10.910 --> 06:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
there um so thanks for the opportunity
 
06:20:12.548 --> 06:20:12.558 align:start position:0%
just you in the
 
06:20:15.030 --> 06:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
road uh my name is Chris Dew was I'm
 
06:20:17.070 --> 06:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
from Hollis New Hampshire I just be
 
06:20:19.390 --> 06:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
brief um I am employed by American
 
06:20:21.430 --> 06:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
Medical Response AMR ambulance I also
 
06:20:23.030 --> 06:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Ambulance
 
06:20:25.510 --> 06:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
Association we support representative PR
 
06:20:28.270 --> 06:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
bill bill um I will point out um and
 
06:20:30.030 --> 06:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
I've been here before and testified on
 
06:20:32.590 --> 06:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
the same uh or similar bills I will
 
06:20:34.430 --> 06:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
point out that the leverage that we're
 
06:20:36.150 --> 06:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get here or have been trying
 
06:20:38.590 --> 06:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
to get for the last 10 plus years is not
 
06:20:40.510 --> 06:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
working so I think we need to do
 
06:20:42.510 --> 06:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
something else and this would be a great
 
06:20:45.830 --> 06:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
first step for uh fairness and an
 
06:20:47.350 --> 06:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the insurance carriers
 
06:20:49.150 --> 06:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
to come to the table and get the
 
06:20:50.910 --> 06:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
attention of the ambulance providers by
 
06:20:52.868 --> 06:20:52.878 align:start position:0%
doing this and getting these folks to
 
06:20:54.910 --> 06:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
try to come into Network I think would
 
06:20:56.750 --> 06:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
it would be great
 
06:20:59.030 --> 06:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
second to that um and chairman you
 
06:21:01.390 --> 06:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
reference it um the ambulance providers
 
06:21:03.390 --> 06:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
ground were left out of the no surprises
 
06:21:05.548 --> 06:21:05.558 align:start position:0%
act for a very specific reason and it's
 
06:21:10.310 --> 06:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
because of the cost for Readiness the um
 
06:21:12.990 --> 06:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
federal government put together a ground
 
06:21:14.548 --> 06:21:14.558 align:start position:0%
ambulance patient billing committee
 
06:21:17.070 --> 06:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
Which senate Apprentice was on they'
 
06:21:18.628 --> 06:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
have come up with their recommendations
 
06:21:20.270 --> 06:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
which are being finalized and they're
 
06:21:21.948 --> 06:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
going to be voted on and sent to
 
06:21:24.990 --> 06:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
Congress so that Congress can include
 
06:21:27.110 --> 06:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance es in the no surprises
 
06:21:28.708 --> 06:21:28.718 align:start position:0%
act so within a very short period of
 
06:21:28.718 --> 06:21:30.110 align:start position:0%
act so within a very short period of
time

06:21:30.110 --> 06:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:21:33.270 --> 06:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
legislatively that piece will be solved
 
06:21:35.788 --> 06:21:35.798 align:start position:0%
um in the meantime I think it's prudent
 
06:21:37.990 --> 06:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
given the way that um healthc care and
 
06:21:40.110 --> 06:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
the economy is being driven that we take
 
06:21:42.150 --> 06:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
the patient out of the middle and get
 
06:21:43.788 --> 06:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
the ambulance providers the dollars that
 
06:21:45.548 --> 06:21:45.558 align:start position:0%
they need so that they can do the
 
06:21:47.510 --> 06:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
services that everyone needs and and
 
06:21:50.270 --> 06:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
wants to be provided with thank
 
06:21:54.548 --> 06:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
you great any questions see
 
06:21:54.558 --> 06:21:56.390 align:start position:0%
you great any questions see
none

06:21:56.390 --> 06:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
none
 
06:21:59.310 --> 06:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
okay what I got here
 
06:22:03.350 --> 06:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh Heather stal is in support of the
