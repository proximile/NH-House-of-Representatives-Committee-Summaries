I hope everybody had a real Pleasant
 
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.490 align:start position:0%
I hope everybody had a real Pleasant
summer

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
summer
 
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
humid hot crummy weather but other than
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
that uh I hope you got some rest and
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
time away from all this
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
um one word and by the way I've had some
 
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
comments about this bottle I sometimes
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
have here I'm not trying to sell Hood
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
milk but it's it's always empty full of
 
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
water and so it's my way of keeping
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
hydrated throughout the the day and I
 
00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
have to refill it two or three times so
 
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
I encourage people here to bring you
 
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
know fluids in here and and whether it
 
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
be a cup of coffee or or water or tea
 
00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
exactly I need something like that
 
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
yeah what do you have in that flask
 
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.629 align:start position:0%
yeah what do you have in that flask
okay

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh we've had those in the past not on
 
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
this committee had a little bit more
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
than H2O in in the flask
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
um so I I'd like to just before we get
 
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
into uh our discussion today on 354 and
 
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
and and on top of that uh School
 
00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
building Aid it's a huge topic which we
 
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
have before us here and it's critical
 
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's a costly program but it's also
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
I feel that fourth leg of instruction
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
and learning if we need to have schools
 
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
which house the facilities necessary for
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
the chemistry labs and for the classroom
 
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
space for the conference rooms for
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
special education on and on it goes and
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
and keep them current
 
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to do just before we get
 
00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
going on this for the committee here
 
00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
um to explain some of the things which
 
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
have gone on in the last couple days in
 
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
this week and previous weeks so that you
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
can be up to Snuff and I can get a
 
00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
little feedback from you one of the
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
things I did do on uh let's see this is
 
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
what Thursday was uh uh when on Tuesday
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
night there was a meeting over at
 
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
Concord High School dealing with the
 
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
ed306 rules
 
00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
and I had an opportunity attend that
 
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
particular hearing they've been uh these
 
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
rule revision which we've talked about
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
which is really very critical and
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
important to uh the minimum standards
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
for public school approval
 
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
um have these hearings been occurring
 
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and if school
 
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
districts request them this is what
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
meeting was requested by the
 
00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:36.539 align:start position:0%
superintendent Merrimack and Concord and
 
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
it was attended fairly well I thought
 
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:42.140 align:start position:0%
there must been about 50 60 people there
 
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh the issue though uh we if Fred
 
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
bramonte who is the previous a previous
 
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
chair of the school board for our state
 
00:08:56.449 --> 00:08:56.459 align:start position:0%

00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
uh following that there was there's some
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
questions and some issues which were
 
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
and I indicated to him we are concerned
 
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
that there's portions there which may be
 
00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:14.459 align:start position:0%
contrary to current statute but also are
 
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
eliminating some of the key elements
 
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:18.620 align:start position:0%
within subject areas and curriculum
 
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899 align:start position:0%

go over there's been a lot going on
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
we've had the teacher shortage going
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
meeting going on we've had the
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
disillusionment uh group for the charter
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
schools we've had the EFA oversight
 
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
committee meeting we've had yesterday
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
the commission for civics education over
 
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:34.940 align:start position:0%
at Granite State
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on a lot of issues
 
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
are are percolating and
 
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.629 align:start position:0%
are are percolating and
um

00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
it all comes down to Dollars and cents
 
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.110 align:start position:0%
it all comes down to Dollars and cents
and

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to get right now if we if
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
there's not any other issues on it and
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
looking at 354 and explain what we'd
 
00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
like to do today at 11 o'clock we do
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
have a zoom coming in with a Joel from
 
00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
the education Commission in the states
 
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
dealing with school building Aid
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to take a break
 
00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
shortly at right right around 10 30 or
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
so thereabouts for a short time for the
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
technology people here to come in and
 
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
set it all up and where we can stand and
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
wander a little bit and then sitting
 
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
down three hours in the morning is not
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
the best thing we healthy thing we
 
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
should all be doing
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
so in the morning what I like to start
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
out right now is you do have a copy of
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
the uh some myths I wrote these aren't
 
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
official minutes the subcommittees we
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
usually don't have them but I wrote down
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
some thoughts immediately following what
 
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
we did in June 12 2003 23.
 
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.850 align:start position:0%
we did in June 12 2003 23.
and

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
um there's on on that page
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
the following handoffs attached for
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
provided committee members we we had a
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
copy of 354.
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
the list of issues needing resolution
 
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
and there is like a through I and
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
probably a lot more issues were brought
 
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.889 align:start position:0%
probably a lot more issues were brought
up

00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
welcome Jen how is Alaska
 
00:15:05.449 --> 00:15:05.459 align:start position:0%
was it really
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
what time do you get home last night
 
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
yeah the red eye is hard to take out of
 
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.389 align:start position:0%
yeah the red eye is hard to take out of
there

00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:18.230 align:start position:0%
there
um

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:20.579 align:start position:0%
well welcome back and we'll we'll keep
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
you awake
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
um the list of issues needing resolution
 
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
a through I there are not all of them
 
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
but is there a way to fund smart
 
00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:31.019 align:start position:0%
projects alongside or separate from
 
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
larger projects I'm this is looking at
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
school building as a total not just the
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
chart or the charter school issue how do
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
Charters fit into the process building
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
support for emergency projects we have
 
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
emergency projects to come up throughout
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
this state and there could be a charter
 
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
or could be a rigor school with arsenic
 
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
in the water or a roof that's leaking
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
where's the funding come up for that
 
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
those are emergency situations I'm sure
 
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
Amy has some ideas in that do security
 
00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
and severe safety issues need special
 
00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
prioritization what is the process for
 
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
previously listed applications of set
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
applications are denied so do they flow
 
00:16:11.689 --> 00:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
over to the next year do they go to the
 
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:13.100 align:start position:0%
top of the Heap
 
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
do those projects go to the top of the
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
list in future considerations should the
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
state share of Grant Awards be offset by
 
00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:23.339 align:start position:0%
by sale of facility property equipment
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
Etc from older facility you know or does
 
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
that go back to the district and
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
um G uh identify funding methods that
 
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
ensure long-term sustainability and
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
identify sources such funds that's a big
 
00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:39.889 align:start position:0%
identify sources such funds that's a big
one

00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
eight should a flat funding per pupil
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
Grant system be considered strengths and
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
weaknesses of that we did have a
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
proposal as recall before division two
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
last year that was put forth by
 
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative hole of having a flat
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
funding scenario
 
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
that's something that I'm sure it's not
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
going away it's it's coming back at us
 
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
the Senate's already putting forward
 
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
legislation in that regard
 
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.210 align:start position:0%
legislation in that regard
um

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
how do the following criteria conditions
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
possibly impact flat funding community
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
property values family income projected
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
grade levels and proposed facility
 
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
geographic location Democrat
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
demographics Etc it all goes on should
 
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
80 percent of the state Grant be
 
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
provided immediately or in consideration
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
of a lesser percentage divide over the
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
length of the bond
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
those were some of the issues which were
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
brought up in conjunction with Where We
 
00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.330 align:start position:0%
brought up in conjunction with Where We
Are

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
Are
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
um I have taken the time to do some
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
exploring and working with some
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets here which I'm going to
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
pass out in a little bit here that came
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
from the ideas came from ECS and some of
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
the other states which we have out there
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
and also based upon what we had
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
presented at division two last year
 
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:57.539 align:start position:0%
but the first thing I'd like to do is
 
00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:00.539 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about hb354 and the
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
purpose of that was to provide funding
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
for Charter Public Schools
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
I'd like to try to identify clearly some
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
of those issues which would impact the
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
funding of the these schools at a 30
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
percent level
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
um so I want to open it up right now to
 
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
a discussion here as to you know why we
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
should do this or why we shouldn't do
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
this or the weaknesses where the
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
strengths what needs to be resolved
 
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
through legislation
 
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
any thoughts on it right now
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
are we all coming in pretty cold in this
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
topic well I
 
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
I think that when we had the initial
 
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
discussions on 354 we found that there
 
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:45.260 align:start position:0%
were inconsistencies in the statutes
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
related to whether
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
funding should be available to school
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
funding School building Aid funding
 
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
should be a
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
available to Charter Schools so I think
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
that um you know that's the point that
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
we start from really on this and
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
I my consideration is that their Public
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
Schools so I think that I would side
 
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
with the statute that says they are
 
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.710 align:start position:0%
with the statute that says they are
eligible

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the direction we
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
should take
 
00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:21.350 align:start position:0%
should take
yes

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:24.500 align:start position:0%
Rick in your uh discussions with the
 
00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
desolution of
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
a charter school
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
was there conversation about the
 
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
allocation of the assets
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
before the assets go from that charter
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
school we and when we were here to talk
 
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
about the dissolution of a charter
 
00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
school yeah
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
we it was an organizational meeting
 
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
and Senator Lang is now the chair of
 
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
that committee we did not get into that
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
discussion uh it is
 
00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
on the list of things to do because that
 
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
would be one of the concerns that I'd
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
have I mean even if we did provide
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
funding for them as a where where do the
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
assets lie because you've got uh you've
 
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
got an independent
 
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
um non-profit basically running the
 
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.450 align:start position:0%
um non-profit basically running the
school

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:16.460 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
and particularly I think if if the
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
if the school is from the school
 
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.150 align:start position:0%
if the school is from the school
district

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
I mean we have a there was an article in
 
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
the paper yesterday
 
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
regarding uh the lakes in The Lakes area
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
where you had the school building that
 
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
was going to be going to the Charter
 
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.510 align:start position:0%
was going to be going to the Charter
School

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
School
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
and the question that I was having as
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
you begin to retrofit the building
 
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
there's a cost for that I'm assuming
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's a certain amount of startup
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
costs that the charter school does
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
receive for the federal government from
 
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
the state and so just what happens this
 
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
is just a question what do we do with
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
those assets if in fact there is a
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
dissolution of the of that particular
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
Charter School
 
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
and if they're going to be looking at
 
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.020 align:start position:0%
that yeah if I could
 
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
um I think there was General agreement
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
that there needed to be some structure
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
laid out for dissolution plans they're
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
pretty much boilerplate
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
it seems now uh in the uh Charter School
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
application which is a requirement
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
um but uh for instance I think with the
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
charter school you're thinking of
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
um uh when they submitted their
 
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
application and were approved they did
 
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
not have a building
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
now they have a building so
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
um you know I would agree that uh the
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
dissolution plan should be Revisited in
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
those types of circumstances because
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
it's changed completely at this point
 
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
there there's a purchase of sale
 
00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
agreement and so forth that outlines
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
some things but I think we need to go
 
00:22:00.409 --> 00:22:00.419 align:start position:0%
back to the uh application and revise
 
00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:03.059 align:start position:0%
the dissolution plan in those
 
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
circumstances and I I think doe
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
indicated that
 
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
um there were they had looked briefly in
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
other states don't seem to have too much
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
in that regard in terms of dissolution
 
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:20.780 align:start position:0%
plans either so um but they are
 
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
in full agreement that the committee
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
should head in that direction so so if I
 
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
may follow up with one so Glenn are you
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
saying that um
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
the doe right now is beginning to look
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
because we have what
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
how many we have four or five that have
 
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
their own building seven I think we have
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
seven in this packet here you're going
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
to see that I handed out there there is
 
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
a communication which we got from doe
 
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
regarding that
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
oh let me get that see if that memo is
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
yes it is
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
um it's from town Bayer is it b-a-y-e-r
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
Amy Amy why don't you we're going to be
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
talking doe and you have that computer
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
on your lap there why don't you just
 
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
come on up and sit right at one of these
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
mics at the table up here because if
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's others who want to testify
 
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
they're gonna have to replace Amy Amy
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
watch this come up and just be you know
 
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
we've done this many times when we are
 
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
asking the technical support from doe
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
just to participate with us
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
that way you can
 
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.529 align:start position:0%
that way you can
yeah

00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:33.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
but the the communication that you see
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
it's this sheet right in this pack of
 
00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:43.010 align:start position:0%
it's this sheet right in this pack of
material

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
when I I did communicate with them
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
and this is from
 
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.430 align:start position:0%
and this is from
um

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
um tal and and Caitlin Davis
 
00:23:57.529 --> 00:23:57.539 align:start position:0%
says there's 21 schools that lease
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
there are 11 schools that own
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
and three schools have not opened yet
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
but will likely lease
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
that's there there are a few of the
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
three I think there's two that are are
 
00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.890 align:start position:0%
three I think there's two that are are
now

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
open I think I think they're opening the
 
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
next door next fall down the road and
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
then the other one is not that sounds
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
correct there were two that opened this
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
and and so if if you look at the cheat
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
just below that sheet that I I'm
 
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
referencing right now you can see the
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
names of the schools and the population
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
within those schools over the uh
 
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
remember when we're looking at a charter
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
school we're not looking at admr we're
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
looking at ADM a
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
because when we when you do uh your
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
school building Aid Amy you look at the
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
average of the last five years of admr
 
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
um that's correct but it wouldn't apply
 
00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:00.419 align:start position:0%
here anyway because Charters that's to
 
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
calculate the building Aid rate where
 
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
charter schools are just a flat 30 so we
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
don't actually apply the calculation at
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
all yeah and so but if we were use a
 
00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:08.570 align:start position:0%
all yeah and so but if we were use a
student

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
population number in there for the grant
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
the comstab was 30 whatever percentage
 
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
then they it would be you have to be an
 
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
adma rather than the admr because they
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
don't have res because they have them
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
from different residents districts but
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
they do have attendance correctly just
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that um if you were I guess
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is if you were to put
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
them in the building Aid calculation we
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
could use adma instead of admr but the
 
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
other factor in there is median family
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
income so we'd also have to solve that
 
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
problem the building Aid rate is a
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
function of those two things medium
 
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
family income and uh equalized valuation
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
for people right yes yeah that that
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
impacts the 30 to 60 percent I I get
 
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
that but if we had a flat rate of 30
 
00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.769 align:start position:0%
that but if we had a flat rate of 30
percent

00:25:56.769 --> 00:25:56.779 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
irregardless of ADM correct or
 
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
regardless of medium family income or
 
00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:04.220 align:start position:0%
the other just it's flat 30 flat Thirty
 
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
and if we had the population would be an
 
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
average or would it be of the previous
 
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.149 align:start position:0%
average or would it be of the previous
year

00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:13.940 align:start position:0%
it's um a little more complicated
 
00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:15.539 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
um it actually isn't really that
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
complicated it's a ranking so it's a
 
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
ranking where you fall within the state
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
that's why the building Aid rates don't
 
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
change very much even if median family
 
00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
income changes or equalized valuation
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
per pupil because it's where you rank
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.610 align:start position:0%
within the state
um

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
explain that a little bit more so the
 
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
building Aid calculation is essentially
 
00:26:39.409 --> 00:26:39.419 align:start position:0%
the median family income you rank all
 
00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
the municipalities then you find the
 
00:26:45.049 --> 00:26:45.059 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per pupil using admr
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
and you rank those and the average of
 
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
those rankings you enter a table so that
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
like let's say if you were number one in
 
00:26:59.450 --> 00:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
the median family income and you were
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
number 20 in equalized valuation per
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
pupil that's where your rank is you
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
would average those I should have picked
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
better numbers but the average of 21
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
which is ten and a half you take that
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
number 10 and a half and you'd enter the
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
table to see what building Aid rate you
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
fall into there's bracketed uh rates for
 
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
what they call the building Aid Factor
 
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
okay I understand that I thought you're
 
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
talking about the ranking of the
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
applications oh no no the rate the rank
 
00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
from The Medium family income and
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.659 --> 00:27:32.029 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:32.039 --> 00:27:32.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
they answer the question I believe
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
there's seven is that correct seven
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
owned uh it sounds right but I'm not
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
sure I don't
 
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
yeah well according to this memo right
 
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.750 align:start position:0%
yeah well according to this memo right
here

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.090 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
so the disillusionment and the there
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of issues
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
um do you give building Aid to a charter
 
00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:00.299 align:start position:0%
would you give building a to a charter
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
school if the building they're in didn't
 
00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:03.649 align:start position:0%
school if the building they're in didn't
meet

00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
meet
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
Life Safety fire safety codes and
 
00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:09.529 align:start position:0%
Life Safety fire safety codes and
no

00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
um not only um to Charter Schools
 
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
um would not receive building a they
 
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
also wouldn't be occupying that for
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
um student occupancy so it's not really
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
a question about building Aid it's that
 
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
they're a public school and have to meet
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
all the same regulations same similar
 
00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:27.299 align:start position:0%
with private schools private schools
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
have certain safety regulations that
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
they're required to meet to public
 
00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:33.539 align:start position:0%
schools have more more requirements but
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be operating a facility if
 
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
they did not meet their life and health
 
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
and safety requirements okay
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
so what I'd like to do is just take a
 
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
second and explain this pack the
 
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
materials I just gave you
 
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:49.909 align:start position:0%
so that
um

00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:57.020 align:start position:0%
11 are you still looking at that so
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
well ten right owned one two three four
 
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
yeah see that's that's probably on
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
purpose because they don't they don't
 
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
have it's virtual so they don't have a
 
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:41.630 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh that the second sheet are going
 
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:48.740 align:start position:0%
underneath this one identifies
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six seven eight
 
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
and it lists their adma
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
for since 2018 through 2022 I I went
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
back five years simply because we go
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
back five years for the other side as an
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
average but uh and but was it that's
 
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
admr this is ADM a
 
00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.130 align:start position:0%
admr this is ADM a
um

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
the the highlighted in in black is the
 
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.409 align:start position:0%
the the highlighted in in black is the
average

00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:30:24.419 --> 00:30:25.789 align:start position:0%
average
um

00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:33.419 align:start position:0%
the the lighter color below whereas um
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
for example like the academy for science
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
design which has 528 kids in it the
 
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059 align:start position:0%
average is 526 if we use the average of
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
five years the average for three years
 
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
would be 529 and if you use the most
 
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
recent year which would 2020 would be
 
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.850 align:start position:0%
recent year which would 2020 would be
528.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
528.
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
um so that's what the lighter color is
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
the lighter color is the average of
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
three years
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
some of them don't have for example if
 
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
you come down to
 
00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
Gathering Waters uh Charter School
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
it's I got an adma for the one year 2022
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
so that if we used a one year that would
 
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
be sliding over there and that's what
 
00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
we'd use
 
00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:18.299 align:start position:0%
but this lists what their populations
 
00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:19.430 align:start position:0%
but this lists what their populations
are

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
some of those are pretty good sized
 
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
so the number of kids
 
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.549 align:start position:0%
so the number of kids
that

00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
are in The Five-Year average for own
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools is 1 409 kids and for
 
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
the three years is one thousand four
 
00:31:44.649 --> 00:31:44.659 align:start position:0%
hundred forty six it's very very close
 
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
very close
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
so and then if you were to add in the
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
the one that has just the one year it'd
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
be a little higher
 
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know I didn't see anything for
 
00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:04.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
so obviously this is a growing list of
 
00:32:12.659 --> 00:32:13.909 align:start position:0%
so obviously this is a growing list of
schools

00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
and Facilities
 
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
Amy when when we have these new schools
 
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
coming in what's the process that the
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
doe does to recognize someone the State
 
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
Board approves
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
do they ask about the facility itself
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't know um towel
 
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
would take them through the um the
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
school board approval for Charter
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
procedure for the facility approval
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
which is separate because that happens
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
after you can't get a facility unless
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
you know your Charter is going to be
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
approved by the state board so after
 
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
um they have a charter that's approved
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
by the state board they if they want a
 
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
facility that's approved then they go
 
00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:54.419 align:start position:0%
through our facility approval process
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
which is making sure that they have a
 
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
emergency operation plan on file that
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
they have their certificate of occupancy
 
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
and they have a approval by the town
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
they don't have asbestos in their
 
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
building they're testing their water
 
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
drinking water for lead and things like
 
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.610 align:start position:0%
drinking water for lead and things like
that

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:14.389 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
um representative black can I um is this
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
the table that you were going over
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
I I hadn't started yet I was gonna I was
 
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.789 align:start position:0%
I I hadn't started yet I was gonna I was
gonna

00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
this is just an example has some just
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
some numbers in there which you know are
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
not solid but it's it's a concept which
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to have something very
 
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
similar coming at us only not using any
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
square footage called based upon
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
population from the Senate
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
so a lot of issues let me explain what
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
we got here in front of you in this
 
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
thing so we can go through it this is
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
and this is in regard to both Charters
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
and public schools
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
I went through and looked at other
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
states and I kind of latched on to the
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
state of Tennessee and several others
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
which have a formula
 
00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:13.379 align:start position:0%
which is sustainable and predictable one
 
00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
of the issues which we have with school
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
building Aid right now is that you saw
 
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
the list we had come to Amy when there
 
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:24.419 align:start position:0%
were 17 applications in last go around
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
how many did you approve three or two
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
have been approved and we're waiting for
 
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
the next waiting here next for our other
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
funding so all these school districts
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
in order to get that application in here
 
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
they've had to put forth a lot of
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
dollars with Architects with Engineers
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
trying to get this application in so it
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
can be looked at as Amy's Amy does
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
they have to put forward 70 80 000
 
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.829 align:start position:0%
they have to put forward 70 80 000
easily

00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
easily
 
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
and they're saying we didn't get an
 
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.329 align:start position:0%
and they're saying we didn't get an
award

00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:56.339 align:start position:0%
award
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
but we had to put forth all this money
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
by the time we get an application
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
approved which might be 10 years from
 
00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.450 align:start position:0%
approved which might be 10 years from
now

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
that may have be done again
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
so they're saying and the people in the
 
00:35:12.849 --> 00:35:12.859 align:start position:0%
communities are saying that's an expense
 
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
that is uh difficult to you know get
 
00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
approved through the voters to go to
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
that site plan site design and all that
 
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
which is done through Architects and
 
00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.790 align:start position:0%
which is done through Architects and
engineers

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
engineers
 
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
so what
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
what the idea I think that J.R Hull is
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
trying to present and that was
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
um one which it was very quick Amendment
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of holes in it and
 
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
we couldn't go with it but he was trying
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
to come up can we do something that's
 
00:35:43.849 --> 00:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
more predictable
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
so a school district knows that they're
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
going to have X number of dollars
 
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.210 align:start position:0%
going to have X number of dollars
available

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
and they can plan for that 10 15 years
 
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
and that is a type of an uh uh formula
 
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.910 align:start position:0%
and that is a type of an uh uh formula
that

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to do something right here
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
with I'm not necessarily sold on it I'm
 
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
just presenting it to us for discussion
 
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
purposes only
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
so the formula has in the spreadsheet
 
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
these columns a b c d e f g h in in the
 
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.790 align:start position:0%
these columns a b c d e f g h in in the
bottom

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.510 align:start position:0%
bottom
um

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
if you look at formula going across and
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
we have extras of these of people out
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
here want to
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
have a copy and follow along with us
 
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.410 align:start position:0%
have a copy and follow along with us
okay

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
yeah and there's a few more right here
 
00:36:35.089 --> 00:36:35.099 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:49.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
okay everybody I think it probably has a
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
copy right now
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
um so looking at the First Column a
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's just your District identification
 
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.130 align:start position:0%
that's just your District identification
number

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
column B is you're going across the
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet identifies the community or
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
the school district this is exactly what
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
we have in current law the the districts
 
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
right there
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
the next column across is your admr for
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
that school district and it's an average
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
of the five years prior to this
 
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:35.060 align:start position:0%
so that would give you a pretty accurate
 
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
understanding of what your residence
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
student population is like
 
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong on that Amy
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
you're doing good okay so far okay so
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
far okay then then in this particular
 
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:56.630 align:start position:0%
far okay then then in this particular
yes

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.210 --> 00:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
that that's a diff that's referencing
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
Charters okay okay so this is right now
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
we're jumping to a formula which would
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
be for the rigor right here if it was
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
the charter as you even looked in the
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
The Proposal was put forth by represent
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
a whole there was another line and
 
00:38:16.609 --> 00:38:16.619 align:start position:0%
that's in back in the back of this
 
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:21.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
yeah it's Amendment uh to hb2
 
00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:35.099 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's it's there and you
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
notice that
 
00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:41.099 align:start position:0%
he has on line 14 through line 16 the
 
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
admr for the school districts but notice
 
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
it's adma and line 20 and through 22.
 
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.619 --> 00:38:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's like apples and oranges
 
00:38:59.569 --> 00:38:59.579 align:start position:0%
so you would well he had it that you
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
would get 30 of your ADM
 
00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.530 align:start position:0%
would get 30 of your ADM
a

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
in in the bill
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
that for his flat model
 
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple of variables the
 
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
three three that that's that is that's a
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
variable it's it's different than than
 
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
it would be for districts that's what
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to go through right now
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
um see if as you're going across the
 
00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet D what I did is I looked at
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
what they had years ago down in
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
Tennessee not years ago about five six
 
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
years ago cost of construction
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
and the cost of construction
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
was based upon square footage per pupil
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
now I've used just for ease of doing
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
this I took an average because the cost
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
if you took square footage per pupil for
 
00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
an elementary school a middle school and
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
the high school they're different
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
and some of the differences that they
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
that was in that report that I looked at
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
was that the elementary
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
per pupil square footage was used back
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
then was 105 square feet
 
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
for the middle school was 110 for a high
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
school was 130.
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
I went through and calculated the
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
percentage of kids in the state which
 
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
are in high schools 9 through 12.
 
00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's about 32 33 percent of our student
 
00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.670 align:start position:0%
it's about 32 33 percent of our student
population

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
and K through 8 is the other
 
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
and so taking the average of these
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
numbers I came up and used to figure 114
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
square feet it could be changed any
 
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
figure you want to use you can use
 
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
but that suggests to get this concept
 
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
across so that square footage was
 
00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.290 align:start position:0%
across so that square footage was
multiplied

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
multiplied
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
at 114 square foot per pupil
 
00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:07.619 align:start position:0%
and at 153 dollars per square foot
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
the cost in Allenstown for example for
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
the costler project would be 9.5 million
 
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.890 align:start position:0%
the costler project would be 9.5 million
dollars

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
but there's other costs
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
which are part of this other than just
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
the building a building
 
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
um with with a contractor and the other
 
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
costs include
 
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
costs for equipment which is put inside
 
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
the building so an additional 10 percent
 
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
was put on there it's on the front seat
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
architect fees seven percent
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
and there's a 20-year debt retirement at
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
six percent
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
so it takes care of the debt so it's a
 
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
total of 123 percent
 
00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:50.579 align:start position:0%
uh is a hundred percent for the cost
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
that we have there in the column
 
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.790 align:start position:0%
that we have there in the column
um

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
the let's see well the one that says 9.5
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
that column multiply that by 123
 
00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.130 align:start position:0%
that column multiply that by 123
percent

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
the cost of that building would now be
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
11.7 million dollars
 
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
it's a district which gets 60 percent
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
based upon their rate of medium family
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
income and equalize valuation per pupil
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
sixty percent of for the state multiply
 
00:42:26.089 --> 00:42:26.099 align:start position:0%
times that 11.7 million would come out
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
to seven million dollars
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
spread over a period a life cycle of 40
 
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.730 align:start position:0%
spread over a period a life cycle of 40
years

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
the amount that they would receive
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
annually would be a hundred and seventy
 
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
six thousand forty nine dollars 81 cents
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
annually that would go to the district
 
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
the concept we're looking at this money
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
would not go to the district it would
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
stay in a building fund controlled by
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
and the interest would go back into the
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
pot that this money is constantly
 
00:43:01.859 --> 00:43:03.589 align:start position:0%
pot that this money is constantly
gaining

00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
gaining
 
00:43:03.599 --> 00:43:05.089 align:start position:0%
gaining
the

00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this whole money is for
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
renovation and construction I'm not
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
changing the rationale or that we use
 
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
currently for building Aid and to access
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
this money it's there for the towns but
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
they still have to complete their
 
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
application that with meeting the
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
criteria and the standards and that
 
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
would go through doe and doe would then
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
authorize the use that money from that
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
fund that's theirs over a period of time
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
um that's the basic concept behind this
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bottom line on this
 
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:41.339 align:start position:0%
type thing on the fourth page the cost
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
of this for the state would be 38
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
million dollars annually
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
we also have a debt or a tail which
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
we're paying off and saying it's roughly
 
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
25 million dollars 24 million dollars
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere around that neighborhood
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
adding that on top of appropriating 50
 
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars isn't going to do it
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
we'd have to appropriate somewhere
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
closer to 60 something or 75 million
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
dollars to get this thing going
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
and there may be some money left over in
 
00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:14.099 align:start position:0%
the pot I know I'm going through a lot a
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
lot here but the money that could that
 
00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
like the interest money gain could be
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
used for emergency projects
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh projects which need immediate
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
attention that the state recognizes need
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
to be done this is a concept which is
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
very similar to what Senator Lang is
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
bringing forward on I don't think he's
 
00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:36.020 align:start position:0%
using the square footage and all that
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
this this formula right here would if
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's done properly would even break it
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
down for square footage by the number of
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
kids that are middle Elementary and high
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
school within each district
 
00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
yeah Cassandra
 
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:58.970 align:start position:0%
yeah Cassandra
yeah

00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
guys that's if you find it all those
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
projects yes annually
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
and of course it would change over the
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
years based on population shifts and the
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
averages there but this is what you
 
00:45:14.329 --> 00:45:14.339 align:start position:0%
would get for example let's look at
 
00:45:14.339 --> 00:45:16.970 align:start position:0%
would get for example let's look at
Berlin

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
right where it's 60 you're 60 yeah
 
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.349 align:start position:0%
right where it's 60 you're 60 yeah
um

00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh went across here so you would be seen
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
each year 349
 
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
113.26 right and the town would have to
 
00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
come up with 10 million so I'm just
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
looking at the two and you have to come
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
up with either State share for your
 
00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
project is about 13 right no your
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
project would total cost additional cost
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
94 million dollars no that's Bedford
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
just look down one oh okay excuse me 23
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
23 yes yes and I was on the wrong line
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
and the state would be about 13. that's
 
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
right so the city would have to come up
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
with about 10. I mean just to round
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
things off
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
so that total at the last on the last
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
page of 38 million is to is that annual
 
00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
allocation that every single School
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
District potentially would get yes okay
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
yeah got it thanks on this for me now if
 
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
you were to change it for example over a
 
00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
30-year life expect cycle
 
00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
you jump it by another 10 million
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
dollars it'd be 48 million dollars
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
that would be the mathematics involved
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
but we try there's a lot of anything to
 
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:32.220 align:start position:0%
change in this is going to right it's
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
going to have a ripple effect across a
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet this is a the concept that
 
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
was brought up at division two yeah but
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
it wasn't as thorough as this or brought
 
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
in some of those conditions are criteria
 
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
so it's something that the legislature
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
is probably going to be faced with
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
having to make a decision how are we
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to do this so so this this concept
 
00:46:59.809 --> 00:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
is basically creating a bank account
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
for each School District
 
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
Reserve funding right and and and the
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
state basically reserves that money
 
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
until the school district says we want
 
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
to build a project
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
yeah and you could have some small
 
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
districts saying after two years well I
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
want to do this I want to do this
 
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
maintenance maintenance is not the same
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
part of this right here that's important
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
so that's important there has to be a on
 
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
this concept there has to be some kind
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
of a Clearinghouse an approval process
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
so you still want to be building
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
according to the standards that we
 
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
just a question so the assumption is so
 
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
I get this right the assumption is that
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
over this course of these x amount of
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
years 20 years 30 years 40 years every
 
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
school district in the state will need
 
00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
to build something
 
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
even though if they don't know that the
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
Assumption the way that's written
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
here you have the life of a building is
 
00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
unless everything is wrong I just think
 
00:47:59.809 --> 00:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
that's that's what tuition on the same
 
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
page that's the concept okay the other
 
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
issue is does this money go into a
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
reserve account within the school
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
district or is it held outside
 
00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
and all that invested so then from that
 
00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:18.020 align:start position:0%
you get interest
 
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
and you could you build with that bigger
 
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
pot and that would pay off some of our
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
debt faster
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
um it also with any other of that
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
Surplus interest and there would be with
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
that amount of money accruing that would
 
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:36.740 align:start position:0%
give that option for emergency
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
applications so uh under this plan
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
could one school district
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
borrow money from another school
 
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
district I'm serious I mean if if if one
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
had we don't have any building plans for
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
the next five or six years and we've got
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
this pot of money here so sure we'll
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
loan it to you assuming that when we get
 
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
ready to do some billing we might be
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
able to borrow it back from you I mean
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's just a question whether or not
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
that's part of this plan or is it just
 
00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:13.220 align:start position:0%
singly singularly
 
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
identified per School District in a big
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
account because I think the float you're
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
of 38 million dollars or whatever it is
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
is a lot more than 13. so I think so
 
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
that was just it's and I'm not raising
 
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
this to be funny but I'm just because I
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
know somebody's going to think about
 
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
that oh yeah sure it's like going down
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
the black hole here but I I I think that
 
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
that it would have to be for that school
 
00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.630 align:start position:0%
that it would have to be for that school
district

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
and before the school district's gonna
 
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
be able to access their pot of money
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to demonstrate to
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
the doe that it's paralleling the
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
standards and criteria that we expect a
 
00:49:56.089 --> 00:49:56.099 align:start position:0%
Schoolhouse look like and they see that
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
it's not just maintenance or custodial
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
type work it is truly renovation and
 
00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
that those start standards we have
 
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
currently in place yeah I would assume
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
that it is just per School District
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
because yes so Robin Peter to pay Paul
 
00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.030 align:start position:0%
because yes so Robin Peter to pay Paul
yeah

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:50:13.609 --> 00:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
I I think the question also would play
 
00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
into is that money kept in the state
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
account yes or in a local account if
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
it's a local account you know oh no who
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
knows no I I if this if you go into this
 
00:50:25.609 --> 00:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
kind of thing it's got to be held in the
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
state yeah absolutely definitely
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
Amy what are your thoughts on this I
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
know you've had this this this whole
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
thing presented we went through it last
 
00:50:36.599 --> 00:50:37.730 align:start position:0%
thing presented we went through it last
year

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
the concept
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
so I would just keep in mind
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
um that this process would be excellent
 
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
in 40 years because a school will have
 
00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:52.859 align:start position:0%
banked enough money
 
00:50:52.859 --> 00:50:54.530 align:start position:0%
banked enough money
um

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
to potentially have a construction
 
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
project but for example in Berlin that
 
00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:02.089 align:start position:0%
project but for example in Berlin that
example

00:51:02.089 --> 00:51:02.099 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
that 13.9 million dollars that you
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
pointed out just keep in mind that
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be available for 40
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
years the the account is going to get
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
349 000 for 40 years so that means
 
00:51:20.049 --> 00:51:20.059 align:start position:0%
for a for a real construction project
 
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
349 thousand dollars is not going to do
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
anything for Community
 
00:51:25.319 --> 00:51:26.510 align:start position:0%
anything for Community
um

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
the actual construction costs for a
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
total project run about 500 to 600 per
 
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
square foot
 
00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:36.020 align:start position:0%
um I realize there's a there's a 23
 
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
addition here uh in the calculation but
 
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.690 align:start position:0%
addition here uh in the calculation but
so

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:44.329 --> 00:51:44.339 align:start position:0%
for New England for our projects
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
um across the country they are not at a
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
hundred and fourteen dollars per square
 
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
foot so like I realized this is a table
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
and you can plug in different numbers
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
and a concept but when you start talking
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
about a total of 38 million we really
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
could be talking about a three times
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
that really could be talking about 120
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
million or so I I get that yeah I
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
understand I just want to make sure
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
other people understood because there
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
was a question about the 13 million like
 
00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:11.900 align:start position:0%
running this process
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
parallel to a process
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
um to assist schools that haven't
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
already been built you know their
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
buildings are already 70 80 years old so
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
it just for me it makes me nervous
 
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
because it feels like a little bit of a
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
delay for 40 years before you get
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
something actually up and running but
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
running it in parallel I mean the
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
concept ultimately is great had we
 
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
thought about it 40 years ago so why not
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
why not start now I'm not saying that
 
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
that that's why not start now that's
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
great just I'm thinking it probably
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
needs to run along a parallel program to
 
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
fund schools now yeah that was the
 
00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:53.290 align:start position:0%
fund schools now yeah that was the
criticism

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:53.300 align:start position:0%
criticism
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
the transition period of getting to
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
where you want this thing functioning
 
00:52:59.930 --> 00:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a lot of time and
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
there's issues out there we know that
 
00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
that need attention but we're not
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
addressing them either now under our
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
situation right three possible projects
 
00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:11.900 align:start position:0%
out of 17
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
uh and and
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
I've talked to several superintendents
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
their their biggest concern is
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
predictability how can I and
 
00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.510 align:start position:0%
predictability how can I and
sustainability

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
sustainability
 
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
how can I predict
 
00:53:28.569 --> 00:53:28.579 align:start position:0%
I can do this building here this year
 
00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
and and that helps the voters understand
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
that too so under our present situation
 
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
it's a crap shoot you should submit your
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
application you may or may not get it
 
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
so and then the only other thing I'd say
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
is it probably should be some kind of
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
price index each year because you know
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
if you delay a project one year you're
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
probably already going to lose 349 000
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
you know on these you know our projects
 
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
are coming just for like scale you know
 
00:53:59.569 --> 00:53:59.579 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh 20 million dollar
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
project is a is a cheap project these
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
days for a small you know we're talking
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
about 20 30 40 90 we're main you know
 
00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
because that's a good comparison Maine
 
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts isn't always the best
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
comparison but Maine is already building
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
um schools over 100 million dollars and
 
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
so just like scale wise obviously it
 
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
depends on the type of school
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
um and the number of students there but
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're still talking about large projects
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
so just keeping in mind that scale
 
00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:29.099 align:start position:0%
that's all I would say and that scale is
 
00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
important you know I I built School up
 
00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
in Alaska was at that time 96 million
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
dollars it's a high school
 
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
we had oil money to do it but
 
00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
it's uh over nine dollars a barrel today
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
um it's so we have buildings like that
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
in this state too that are potential for
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
that that would wipe out what we're
 
00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
doing in our present formula we would
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
never be able to accomplish that with 80
 
00:54:57.849 --> 00:54:57.859 align:start position:0%
up front
 
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
so so we have a quandary here as far how
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to handle this so Amy um as
 
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
you look at your
 
00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
your spreadsheet or whatever your uh
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
your Ouija board you use to look at this
 
00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
stuff how is there a differentiation
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
between new construction
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis that of renovation
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
is there is there a differentiation
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
between priority as far as a new
 
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
building vis-a-vis a retrofitting an
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
older building no there wouldn't be a
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
priority and I'd say more our
 
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
communities are
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
cost wise it used
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
that you see easy cheaper to do
 
00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:41.099 align:start position:0%
renovation but that's not always the
 
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
case the costs are really relatively
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
similar and so there's a big push to
 
00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
focus more on renovation not from the
 
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
department but just
 
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
um globally or Community wise it can be
 
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
more sustainable schools are used to
 
00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
having that building in their community
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
and they're attached to it and it
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean that you're
 
00:56:04.609 --> 00:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
saving money or not for renovation
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
versus you know
 
00:56:06.839 --> 00:56:09.170 align:start position:0%
versus you know
yes

00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
just a quick question what do you
 
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
consider the life cycle of a building
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
yeah 40 years is good I mean in 40 years
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
is uh 40 years is what the data shows to
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
um after 40 years you're looking at some
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh significant deterioration of a
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
building of a school building
 
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.430 align:start position:0%
building of a school building
specifically

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
of that type of building
 
00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
so I I think the concept is good because
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
I I think if you look at big picture
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
okay New Hampshire needs to invest in
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
its school buildings
 
00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:44.099 align:start position:0%
I mean I have a school 98 years old the
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
other one 51 years old
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
and with the biomass going down the
 
00:56:49.319 --> 00:56:50.210 align:start position:0%
and with the biomass going down the
tubes

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
tubes
 
00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
um will never come up with 10 million
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
dollars you know raised locally
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
some plan that we knew down the road I
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
think 40 years is a long time because
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
then you got to start almost all over
 
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
again don't you
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
if that time were a little bit shortened
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
and I'm watching Littleton that's gone
 
00:57:16.849 --> 00:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
through that situ you know this process
 
00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:21.059 align:start position:0%
for years yes and Colebrook going
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
through it
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
who knows maybe years you know
 
00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
who who knows right
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
um but I like the idea
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
of the investment in our buildings for
 
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
our kids
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
because like I say they vary all over
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
the state and I really wanted to get a
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
survey out find out how many schools
 
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
actually had that double vestibule
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
entrance for school safety
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
because I know ours do not because we
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
never could generate the local funds
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know to be able to do that on a 98
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
year old building but I know there are a
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
lot of other small towns that have
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
particularly older buildings and they're
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
The Hub of those communities but I do
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
like that concept of looking
 
00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
at that big picture
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
that's what I hear from a lot of
 
00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
superintendents they they're looking for
 
00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:22.690 align:start position:0%
superintendents they they're looking for
predictability

00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:22.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
experience can I go back to a comment
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
you made
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
um Rick's chives predicating the the
 
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
numbers on the 114 square foot right
 
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
that's all right and you you said the
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
average cost in Hampshire is five to six
 
00:58:36.119 --> 00:58:36.950 align:start position:0%
average cost in Hampshire is five to six
hundred

00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh correct for the total project cost so
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
that would I think in the table it's
 
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
114. uh 153 and then there's a 23 bump
 
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
so 180 dollars a square foot let's run
 
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
this table it's yours basically you're
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
talking three times that
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
um approximately yeah in Baltimore okay
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
so these numbers would be three times
 
00:58:58.980 --> 00:58:59.870 align:start position:0%
so these numbers would be three times
that

00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
um also the square footage um is 114 on
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
the table and our state average that
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
that schools cannot meet in design is
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
approximately 140 square feet we're
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
really closer to 180. it does depend
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
Elementary Middle High but that 140 we
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
have not seen a school be able to meet
 
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
that with the special education
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
um spaces that are needed and
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
um and keeping class sizes down to
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
closer to 20 than 25. I'm not sure about
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
Tennessee but uh in New Hampshire the 20
 
00:59:30.839 --> 00:59:32.150 align:start position:0%
Tennessee but uh in New Hampshire the 20
is

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
um where people you know the schools are
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
kind of floating yeah it's amazing so
 
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying 140 would be the minimum
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
minimum or 180.
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
um minimum would be 140 140 square feet
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
but then I made in that threshold
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
um it varies I'm trying to think of the
 
00:59:50.089 --> 00:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
numbers that's got categories of you
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
know the the smaller your school is
 
00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:56.339 align:start position:0%
population wise the more square foot per
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
pupil you need because you still need a
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
cafeteria space you still need a gym
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
space right
 
01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
um but I would say the average is
 
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
between if you wanted to use an average
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
150 to 1
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
70 or 80. the range though is probably
 
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
140 to 200 like if you wanted to think
 
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
like wow 120 square feet per pupil
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's a tight spool
 
01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:24.299 align:start position:0%
um and they've got their spaces like
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
probably really maximized and then 200
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
square feet per pupil is
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
um is closer to probably that school has
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of special education or special
 
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
services in there in in their school
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
districts okay thank you thank you
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
so one of the questions I'd have too um
 
01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:49.430 align:start position:0%
so one of the questions I'd have too um
first

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.329 --> 01:00:52.339 align:start position:0%
I I wonder if this is kind of a
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
multi-prong approach would be better
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
because I think of the schools that are
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
in line for building ad but they're
 
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
number four five on the list and they
 
01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:04.859 align:start position:0%
come away with with nothing where as in
 
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
under this program at least they'd have
 
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
something in the bank but we can't do
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know we can't fund both things at
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
the same time with this the pot of money
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
that we have but I wonder if we could
 
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
tweak it enough that you could still
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
move on everybody could still move on
 
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
rather than depending on one for source
 
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
of funding and that's that very short
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
okay now the question I would have how
 
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
do you deal with the projection of
 
01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
student population
 
01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
when you begin to look at either
 
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
renovating a building or building a new
 
01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.170 align:start position:0%
renovating a building or building a new
building

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
how do you know what the student
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
population is going to be in 10 years
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a very very good question in
 
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
order to apply for building Aid you have
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
to submit some statistical analysis of
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
your projected population on those
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
projections in a lot of schools are
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
going down
 
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
um so we use the Cur whatever their
 
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
current enrollment is for sizing the
 
01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.430 align:start position:0%
current enrollment is for sizing the
school

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:15.299 align:start position:0%
it is a little risky because there are
 
01:02:15.299 --> 01:02:16.609 align:start position:0%
it is a little risky because there are
some

01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
enrollment if you are not talking about
 
01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
alternative types of Education
 
01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
enrollment could look like does come in
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
waves so there could be an uptick I know
 
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's not a popular statement
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
um but um that is what like a lot of the
 
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.210 align:start position:0%
um but um that is what like a lot of the
enrollment

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
experts say but then you have to compare
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
that with alternative types of Education
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
impacting public schools and and it's
 
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
really difficult to to project
 
01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:46.740 align:start position:0%
um so we don't see many designs we see
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
schools proposing for some increase in
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
population depending on the school
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
district but the state doesn't pay for
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
that portion of that increase we cap it
 
01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:00.059 align:start position:0%
at their existing enrollment numbers if
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
okay now what we also
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
have to always consider is we have a
 
01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
debt we're paying off
 
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh on top of for example just going the
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
flow there and let's say we had
 
01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
something where was 38 million dollars
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
which we obligate this year or whatever
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
year it might be
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
in looking at the chart right here
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
we handed out the last one the tail and
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
the debt for FY 2425
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
the total obligations
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
are close to 50 million bucks
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
so we appropriate 50 million dollars
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
supposedly each year so that leaves 50
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars left but that drops off
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
very quickly here so if I go down let's
 
01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
say to
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
fy2829 the debt is
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
27 million dollars total so it's in the
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
present formula it's going to give us
 
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
more money for school construction and
 
01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.490 align:start position:0%
more money for school construction and
renovation

01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:09.059 align:start position:0%
but it's still not going to catch up
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
with the needs which we have
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh with a formula like this if the money
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
were invested
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
and if you put 38 or 50 million dollars
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
in the pot or 60 million you'd have to
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
put 38 million plus the debt for let's
 
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:25.849 align:start position:0%
put 38 million plus the debt for let's
say

01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:25.859 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
another 50 million on top of that
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
to pay off the debt if you're it's it's
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to come up more than what we
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
are presently allocating anyway I think
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
you shake or bake this it's going to
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
have to be more money to start out so
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
you can build up that state pot and the
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
interest will then help accrue and take
 
01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:47.339 align:start position:0%
care of some of those immediate issues
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
in that transition process
 
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
I don't have the figures in that because
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
I haven't done that calculation as far
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
as what the interest would garnish
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
against us
 
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
can yes um could I just put a reminder
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
out there to because I feel like this
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
gets lost sometimes that 50 million
 
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
dollar cap was put in place in 2013.
 
01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
um and I just want people to remember
 
01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
that in the late 2000s 2009 maybe even
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
2010 the state was spending over 60
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
maybe even 64 million dollars per year
 
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:26.099 align:start position:0%
um before that cap if you account the
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
bond in 2010 when that started too so
 
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
like just thinking about the amount of
 
01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
money that we were spending was more
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
back in 2009 2010 2011 than it is now
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
it's just something to keep in mind too
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
I think that the kind of gets lost
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
because the cap is there in the law but
 
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
it was a number that could be
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
sustainable yeah and then I also want to
 
01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
point out uh since this is a work
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
session I did run some numbers
 
01:05:57.839 --> 01:05:58.970 align:start position:0%
session I did run some numbers
um

01:05:58.970 --> 01:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
um for you all because this this chart
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
here there's another
 
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
potential mesh with what you have here
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
too and that's that keep in mind that
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
the state my Bureau has all the all
 
01:06:15.049 --> 01:06:15.059 align:start position:0%
construction projects prior to the
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
moratorium were funded through the
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Education there was no
 
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
ranking list they put an application in
 
01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
and the state funded that share okay so
 
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
again I think it's very important to not
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
lose sight that that those projects were
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
funded all of them prior to the
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
moratorium so this because of that we
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
have a very robust list of projects all
 
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
the way back
 
01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:40.010 align:start position:0%
the way back
um

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:42.299 align:start position:0%
we have them in paper form back from the
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
40s and 50s but we have them all in a
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
database from 1970 and on so if you kind
 
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
of wanted to mesh this with a credit of
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
some schools have already received some
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
square footage then you could do that
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
you could do something potentially like
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
you know if you got
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to make this too technical
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
but if you got so much square footage
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
built last year then that could come off
 
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
your credit at a hundred percent right
 
01:07:14.329 --> 01:07:14.339 align:start position:0%
because it was just built last year and
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
then you could traction that off 40 40 1
 
01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
over 40 is two and a half percent so you
 
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
could take two and a half percent and
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
reduce that every year which means that
 
01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:27.299 align:start position:0%
somebody that took building Aid and
 
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
built you could take their square
 
01:07:31.609 --> 01:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
footage and reduce it by two and a half
 
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
percent each year as you go back
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
something to
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
kind of shift some of that money to
 
01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
districts that haven't tapped into
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
building a for a long time and then
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
shift less money to those districts that
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
have received building Aid in the last
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
40 years and then the last number I
 
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to put out there is that
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
um just again for scale
 
01:07:58.609 --> 01:07:58.619 align:start position:0%
um the state
 
01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:00.299 align:start position:0%
um funded
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh in over a 37-year period that happens
 
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
to be from 1973
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
um to 2009 before the moratorium
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
um 27 million square feet of Renovations
 
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
and additions uh to schools and that
 
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
average square footage I can put this
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
all in numbers and I can confirm my
 
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
numbers later but that average square
 
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
footage is about 700
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
000 square feet per year that the
 
01:08:35.329 --> 01:08:35.339 align:start position:0%
program was operating at that time if
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
you take that and multiply it by 550 a
 
01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
square foot and you apply the average
 
01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
rate of 38 percent you come out to be
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
154 million dollars of state aid per
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
year so just giving you that kind of
 
01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:51.050 align:start position:0%
year so just giving you that kind of
um

01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
the take home math on that is if you
 
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
were to compare today's dollars to what
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
the program was doing prior to the
 
01:09:02.329 --> 01:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
moratorium it's approximately in today's
 
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
dollars about 154 million if you were to
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
look at the last
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
um since 1973 to prior to Marge for you
 
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
so some numbers fruits are thought I
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if that confuses things it
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
makes things better or we were funding
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
all Commerce you put an application in
 
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
it was approved
 
01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:25.259 align:start position:0%
um well that's not no that's not true it
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
was approved under the regulations the
 
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
only projects that were eligible were
 
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
approved they still had caps on square
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
footage they still had caps on the a
 
01:09:34.849 --> 01:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
dollar amount
 
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
um I understand that Amy but if they
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
they complied with all the standards the
 
01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
criteria they were approved correct
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
correct now it's not that way corrects
 
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
okay and that is limited right we were
 
01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:48.299 align:start position:0%
in terms of the rest of states in this
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
country funding at about the average
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
level around 20th or 29th somewhere in
 
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
that in of the states now we're nowhere
 
01:09:58.330 --> 01:09:58.340 align:start position:0%
near that we're at Rock Bottom correct
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
so it has changed and our debt was
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
significant back then you know it you
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
know it was 540 plus million dollars
 
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
so so we I I what I'm just trying to say
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
is that I think we have come to the
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
point where we got to do something here
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a transition plan
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some kind of formula
 
01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
and we've got to help the school
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
districts uh ah yeah we have buildings
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
that don't have an Arctic our entry
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
areas that are secure
 
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
we have Littleton grade school which is
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
two-story building that's just some
 
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
trouble we've got Colebrook right now
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
they can't get the bonding done to do
 
01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
their school
 
01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:40.310 align:start position:0%
their school
so

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some answers to this
 
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
and I I think that we can't just keep
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
tweaking the formula we and I know
 
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
there's legislation you you've given me
 
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
to try to put forward here regarding the
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and all that and the
 
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
application process
 
01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
that's good we'll we'll do we'll do that
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
but uh somehow we've got to really shift
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
our gears a little bit here and and plan
 
01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.229 align:start position:0%
our gears a little bit here and and plan
for

01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
so how to be Forward Thinking uh
 
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
we've got to be we gotta do something
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
that's true now in looking at this
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet too if you go to the next
 
01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
sheet Beyond
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
if you took this formula
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
and applied it to Charter Schools
 
01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
there is one sheet that looks sort of
 
01:11:33.649 --> 01:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
like this in the in the bundle
 
01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
and if and I I took a three-year average
 
01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
I should have just taken the last year
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
of adma uh but a rate you can see what
 
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
the state share would be for those
 
01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
buildings because there are very few of
 
01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
them there's only like seven or so I
 
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
used square footage not a whole lot of
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
square footage so the annual cost for
 
01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
the whole state all Charter Schools will
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
be around 232 thousand dollars
 
01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.770 align:start position:0%
be around 232 thousand dollars
annually

01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
annually
 
01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the last one of those
 
01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
I put one in there for a specific School
 
01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh Academy for Science and design they
 
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
would receive 85 000 a year out of this
 
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
out of this pot if it's funded at 30
 
01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:28.010 align:start position:0%
out of this pot if it's funded at 30
percent

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
using the same type of formula
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
so the charter schools are not going to
 
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
eat a whole lot out of this the biggest
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
elephant in the room is the school
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
districts the charter schools are very
 
01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
insignificant they basically have a
 
01:12:44.209 --> 01:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
little less than two percent of our
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:53.169 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:53.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
that's just more informational for you
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
right there what it would cost so is
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
this based upon the whole formula yeah
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I I when I did the formula because
 
01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
I couldn't throw at this in because uh
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's no five-year average there's
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
none of that for the of the resident
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have resident they use adma
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
and so but the formula you can see is
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
basically is similar
 
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:22.250 align:start position:0%
basically is similar
um

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
and the state shares over 40 years it
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
was based upon a flat 30 percent for all
 
01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
so in the in the grand picture the big
 
01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
picture of the charter schools have they
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
become part of this and the funded at
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
that level is not going to be a
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
can I ask why they're put at 30 percent
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
there's they don't fit in the formula
 
01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:00.620 align:start position:0%
that's in law right now isn't it
 
01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
right now okay so it's not now this not
 
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
arrived at the same way but that's a
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
statute correct I don't know how it got
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
there it's a minimum it's the minimum
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
well how would you figure out
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
medium family equalized property
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
valuation and all that that'd be a huge
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
issue with the charter school seeing the
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
kids come from various districts
 
01:14:32.209 --> 01:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
or towns
 
01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
I think that'd be a huge huge
 
01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
well that's why I asked because it
 
01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.310 align:start position:0%
well that's why I asked because it
sounds

01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
sounds
 
01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.649 align:start position:0%
sounds
amazing

01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:39.659 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
have you had inquiries from Charter
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
Schools before building a yes I'm sure
 
01:14:48.169 --> 01:14:48.179 align:start position:0%
that Charter Schools would like to
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
um you know be able to fill out an
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
application we've had Charter Schools
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
fill out an application it's a it's an
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
easy ad for us I mean like to our to our
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
list you know it's not like it's
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
overwhelming we'll get one charter
 
01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
school probably every once in a while
 
01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
that would probably put an application
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
in uh in there in uh it is for
 
01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
substantial the current laws it's for
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
substantial renovation and new
 
01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
construction so it's not a I think
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not just charter schools
 
01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
public school districts too might
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstand that what the purpose of
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
building Aid is and want to do a roof or
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know a window project or things like
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
that that are not eligible
 
01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.070 align:start position:0%
that that are not eligible
so

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
letting you have more information
 
01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.050 align:start position:0%
letting you have more information
tonight

01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
when a charter school
 
01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
when a charter school initiates its
 
01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.250 align:start position:0%
when a charter school initiates its
program

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
and it has a site that it's in
 
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
does it get Federal money
 
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
for the site development or the Building
 
01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:53.270 align:start position:0%
for the site development or the Building
Development

01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
Development
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
Etc how how is that currently worked if
 
01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
I'm starting a charter school and I
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
let's say I don't own a building I'm
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
just I want to lease it but I need to to
 
01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.450 align:start position:0%
just I want to lease it but I need to to
retrofit

01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
retrofit
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
Etc what's what's the difference there
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
is a small lease Aid so that was what it
 
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
represents on the lease this morning too
 
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
weren't you or talk about the lease
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
program well I can yeah I think it'd be
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
good then you're hitting our topic we
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
need to address in terms of the federal
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
funding that's available
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how much of that is
 
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
available for
 
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
um you know startup with a building I
 
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
don't think very much I
 
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
um I know that the building that was
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
purchased by our local charter school
 
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
that's going to be starting up they're
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
talking about I think it's at least
 
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
seven or eight hundred thousand dollars
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
in renovations to get started to open
 
01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
the door including ADA compliance and
 
01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
safety compliance with egress and and so
 
01:16:58.970 --> 01:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
forth and where does that where does
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
that money get generated from obviously
 
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
not from they're talking about having to
 
01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
raise it okay so uh there well actually
 
01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
I think yeah okay yeah
 
01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:12.500 align:start position:0%
um uh probably going to do a mortgage
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
instruction mortgage
 
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and then factor into their budget the
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
that annual cost of
 
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
that loan that debt all right it's going
 
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
to eat the he's speaking about the one
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
in OSP yeah I thought they got about 1.1
 
01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
million started from Federal
 
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
right but I don't think that they can
 
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
use that for the renovation of the the
 
01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:41.570 align:start position:0%
use that for the renovation of the the
building

01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
Amy I'll double check but I don't think
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's about I I it's broken I think
 
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
earlier that we have to have an
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
understanding of the lease program how
 
01:17:53.689 --> 01:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
does that work
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
so the lease aid program so it does fall
 
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
under RSA 19815 so it falls under the
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
building Aid regulations but they're a
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
separate appropriation so the building
 
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
appropriation is to school districts
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
that own their own building lease eight
 
01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
is to charter schools that lease
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
buildings uh and so the Lee said right
 
01:18:17.050 --> 01:18:17.060 align:start position:0%
now is 30
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
of the eligible costs in at least 30
 
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
each 50 000. you've capped out at fifty
 
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars correct um and I I
 
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
don't have the numbers in front of me
 
01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
but I'm gonna ballpark it and say half
 
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
the schools receive the full 30 and half
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
the schools are subject to the cap
 
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
um so in this new formula you write like
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
Academy of Science design getting 85 000
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
per year that's a really big win for
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
them because if they were to lease a
 
01:18:46.729 --> 01:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
building they'd only get 30 percent uh
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh I mean fifty thousand dollars thirty
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
percent up to fifty thousand dollars so
 
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
Academy for Science and design is
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
definitely one of those that gets capped
 
01:18:57.290 --> 01:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
significantly by lease aid but um other
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
school this other charter schools are
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
being able to pay the Department of
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
Education through lease aid pays for
 
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's it's separate than
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
building AIDS so what we do is we take
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
the appropriation and appropriate it if
 
01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough money then we
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
prorate everybody at the same rate if we
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
ran out of money we might only end up
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
paying them 85 percent of what their
 
01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
award would have been because that's all
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
the money we have this year we will not
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
be um doing any
 
01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
um prorating because we have enough uh
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
funds to how much do we appropriate a
 
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
year for a lease a uh it's changed over
 
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
the just like the moratorium lisaid was
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
also not funded I I believe maybe the
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
last three years this might be our third
 
01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
or maybe our fourth year of funding
 
01:19:46.739 --> 01:19:47.390 align:start position:0%
or maybe our fourth year of funding
um

01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
I am again who can't promise these
 
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
numbers are accurate but I think the
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
first year it was like 200 000 or 250
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
000 for lease Aid and I think we
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
prorated everybody we cut their payments
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
by like 60 because we couldn't it wasn't
 
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
even near enough so then the next uh
 
01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
biennium they uh appropriated
 
01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
um I think a half a million dollars and
 
01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
then they also increased the cap it went
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
from thirty thousand dollar cap to a
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollar cap and I think
 
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:17.219 align:start position:0%
we've still had to prorate schools
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
um maybe
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
90 uh we were able to give them 90 of
 
01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
their award and then the last two years
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
we've given about 100 percent
 
01:20:30.649 --> 01:20:30.659 align:start position:0%
but that's a separate project it's a
 
01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
separate budget line item correct the
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
this current biennium it's 850 000 per
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
year that we have for lease Aid
 
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
and I think the requests are somewhere
 
01:20:44.689 --> 01:20:44.699 align:start position:0%
near six hundred thousand dollars so we
 
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
had enough money assist lease program
 
01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
just for Charter Schools or for
 
01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
districts as well it's just for Charter
 
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
Schools we don't have any school
 
01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
districts that at least anyway but it is
 
01:20:58.850 --> 01:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
the the law actually we say it actually
 
01:21:01.010 --> 01:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
covers Career and Technical Education
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
Centers too but the law I don't know if
 
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
it's in House Bill 2 or somewhere along
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
the appropriation the appropriation of
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
that 850 000 says that it's only for
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools even though lease Aid is
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
available for Career and Technical
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
Education Centers as well with that said
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any career in technical
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
Education Centers at least so nobody has
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
any heartburn over that requirement but
 
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
um in the law it's specific to Charter
 
01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:31.070 align:start position:0%
um in the law it's specific to Charter
Schools

01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
Schools
 
01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
a lot to this
 
01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
we heard the other day in the
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
dissolution we were trying to figure out
 
01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
uh there are schools that start out
 
01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:53.219 align:start position:0%
Leasing but then end up buying and
 
01:21:53.219 --> 01:21:54.229 align:start position:0%
Leasing but then end up buying and
owning

01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
owning
 
01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
but when the charter was initially
 
01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
written there is no no language or you
 
01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:05.090 align:start position:0%
written there is no no language or you
know

01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
for the possible dissolution of
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
something eventually they've owned
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
and so so the dissolution according to
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
what we heard from Caitlin is basically
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
a boilerplate of several issues
 
01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:20.810 align:start position:0%
a boilerplate of several issues
that

01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
many places are using but there's no
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
real definition am I correct Glenn and
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
where I'm going with this I think so
 
01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.090 align:start position:0%
where I'm going with this I think so
yeah

01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
we didn't have time to look at them
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to have more coming to us
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
because this was just an organizational
 
01:22:33.179 --> 01:22:34.189 align:start position:0%
because this was just an organizational
meeting

01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
charges that granted
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
I think there's something business side
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
his own
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
I I couldn't honestly tell you that
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
there there are some charters in trouble
 
01:23:01.729 --> 01:23:01.739 align:start position:0%
yeah but uh uh in looking at these
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
numbers of attendance that we see here
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
some when we see school has 298 kids
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
call 300 kids Seacoast
 
01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
and you look at the science academy uh
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
they're they're pretty good micro
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
Society Academy those are are fairly
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
good-sized schools
 
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
the grade levels I don't know what
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
specifically their grade levels most of
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
them don't have a high school mostly the
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
so going back then of course we we're
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
going to take a break here in about
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
seven minutes here so we accept the zoom
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we told the people for the
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
ECS they're going to come in and talk
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
more about funding plans and
 
01:23:53.209 --> 01:23:53.219 align:start position:0%
possibilities for for public school
 
01:23:53.219 --> 01:23:55.910 align:start position:0%
possibilities for for public school
buildings

01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.970 align:start position:0%
buildings
um

01:23:58.970 --> 01:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
I guess are there any further questions
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
on this right now I think we should come
 
01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
down and say
 
01:24:08.689 --> 01:24:08.699 align:start position:0%
do we move forward or where are we on
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
funding of some type for charter schools
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
are we recognizing that the they do need
 
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
some support or we're already doing a
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
my first
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah what was I talking how to
 
01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:27.169 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah what was I talking how to
turn

01:24:27.169 --> 01:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
turn
 
01:24:27.179 --> 01:24:28.490 align:start position:0%
turn
um

01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
I think we need to address the building
 
01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
and then once we have a system in place
 
01:24:43.729 --> 01:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
then it makes sense to include Charter
 
01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
but we have so many buildings that are
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:49.729 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:24:49.729 --> 01:24:49.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
that we have to prioritize just when the
 
01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
applications come in with the monies
 
01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
that we have now they have to be
 
01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:58.130 align:start position:0%
that we have now they have to be
prioritized

01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.010 --> 01:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
you should go ahead Glenn um
 
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
we have to build pending the routine for
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
Charter School building I think 354 too
 
01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
right I need to address that
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
um this just today in New Hampshire
 
01:25:15.649 --> 01:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
Business Review an article as Charter
 
01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
Schools expand in New Hampshire the push
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
is on to find more space enrollment
 
01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
numbers policy changes are creating
 
01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:23.990 align:start position:0%
numbers policy changes are creating
tensions

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
tensions
 
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh a growing number of charter schools
 
01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
and I think that we have to their Public
 
01:25:37.729 --> 01:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
we have to also Define
 
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
or the asset who owns yes
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
because when you're going to be dealing
 
01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
with public companies going to a private
 
01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:53.149 align:start position:0%
with public companies going to a private
entity

01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
entity
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
and unless I'm wrong
 
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
a chart a public charter school is run
 
01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
in all the cases today there is the
 
01:26:12.169 --> 01:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
option for a district
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
um to do a charter school right
 
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
um right
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
um and and in that instance Glenn
 
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
there's no question in my mind where the
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
facility is and who owns it but when
 
01:26:25.729 --> 01:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
you've got
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
the number that we have now they're
 
01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.550 align:start position:0%
the number that we have now they're
growing

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
that are in fact independent groups
 
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
receiving public monies that are now
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
going to have assets
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
that that to me the desolution question
 
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
the group looking at that I'm assuming
 
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
they're going to look to see where do
 
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
those assets go what does it mean to
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
have an asset who owns it
 
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
when it's being paid for with public
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
monies I mean that that is a to me
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
that's a threshold question
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
that needs to be answered I think before
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
we start talking
 
01:26:59.159 --> 01:27:00.709 align:start position:0%
we start talking
about

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
building Aid further building Aid going
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
in I mean that's it only seems logical
 
01:27:07.729 --> 01:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
to me to have that understanding first
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
except because right now Amy I'm I'm
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
assuming it's it's not clear
 
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
who owns the asset
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
I guess I would just keep in mind the
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
way this house bill 354 is written
 
01:27:29.209 --> 01:27:29.219 align:start position:0%
um that they're only getting 1 20th of
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
the payment like the trying to mimic the
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
term of the bond right so
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to figure out like what
 
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
would be the difference between lease
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
Aid paying every year and building Aid
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
every year to a charter school it's not
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
like they're getting the 80 percent up
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
front like the public district schools
 
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
are so to me it's the same risk as
 
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
lisaid you know they're the least say
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're receiving and they're paying
 
01:27:59.810 --> 01:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
their landlord
 
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
um we're building Aid they're putting
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
into an asset
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
um we would have the ability if they um
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
dissolved after two years to stop paying
 
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
building AIDS so we would recoup 18
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
years of we would not be paying 18 years
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
up there
 
01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:16.370 align:start position:0%
up there
um

01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
their building Aid payment if that makes
 
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
sense I feel like that that's the reason
 
01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
that was in there was to to address
 
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
those asset concerns
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
um stop right there for a second if in
 
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
fact we have in law that
 
01:28:33.169 --> 01:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
let's say Berlin
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
has taken building a for school building
 
01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.350 align:start position:0%
has taken building a for school building
a

01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
they closed School building Aid a down
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
five years later
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
I understand my reading was they got to
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
pay back
 
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
that building Aid they had to improve
 
01:28:56.570 --> 01:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
building a that is correct is that the
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
same deal with the charter schools that
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
is also correct but it's just a matter
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
of trying to figure out how
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
a charter school goes under right that
 
01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
if they go bankrupt how do we actually
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
get that money back I'm just saying like
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
with the public school district it might
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
be easier to do with a charter school
 
01:29:16.850 --> 01:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
you might be running a little bit more
 
01:29:18.890 --> 01:29:18.900 align:start position:0%
risk but is it really that much risk
 
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
because you just essentially paid them
 
01:29:25.129 --> 01:29:25.139 align:start position:0%
up a 120th payment every year which is
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
kind of equivalent to lease Aid you're
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
paying a a bill every year to somebody
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
else who owns the asset for me I I don't
 
01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:34.669 align:start position:0%
else who owns the asset for me I I don't
um

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
see with the Rook with the new language
 
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
remember this language wasn't here when
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
the when you first saw the bill but now
 
01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
that this bill is in here and you're
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
paying 120th of the building Aid and it
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
also gets to
 
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
um kind of Representative cascadden's
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
concern like about the amount of dollars
 
01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
um the amount of dollars that would be
 
01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:55.430 align:start position:0%
um the amount of dollars that would be
appropriated

01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
um to that Charter School let's say the
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
charter school ranks higher than the
 
01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
Public District school and they're
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
seeking most likely they're seeking a
 
01:30:04.010 --> 01:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
lot less money than a public school
 
01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
district because they're in typically
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
smaller but let's say they're building
 
01:30:09.649 --> 01:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
Aid they're seeking 1 million in
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
building Aid We're going to be paying
 
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.709 align:start position:0%
building Aid We're going to be paying
them

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.290 --> 01:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars a year
 
01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:19.550 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars a year
um so

01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
um fifty thousand dollars a year is what
 
01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
they would be taking whereas a public
 
01:30:24.890 --> 01:30:24.900 align:start position:0%
District school would be maybe seeking
 
01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars like they just don't
 
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
um I don't see that as being a big
 
01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
threat to the Billy Aid bucket having
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
charter schools there just so but again
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
just process wise I'm I'm not here to
 
01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:39.900 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to formulate process
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
wise it doesn't seem like that would
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
play a role
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I I I agree I I wouldn't
 
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
like to see
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
Charter Public Schools that have made
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
the investment of buying a building be
 
01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
disqualified because they have put down
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
Roots you know and if other schools are
 
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
getting lease Aid
 
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
um I think that's made a step in the
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
right direction to get a building and I
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
don't think they should be penalized for
 
01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:08.270 align:start position:0%
don't think they should be penalized for
that

01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things we did have before the
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
dissolution meeting started I handed Tim
 
01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:14.870 align:start position:0%
dissolution meeting started I handed Tim
Lang

01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
Lang
 
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
um the and you can look it up on the web
 
01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
dissolution of charter schools in North
 
01:31:22.669 --> 01:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
in North Carolina
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
and there's a process in order for them
 
01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:26.219 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
this age you're talking about they have
 
01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
to have a plan and and either the bank a
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they have the substance
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
to support if if the dissolution occurs
 
01:31:42.410 --> 01:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
and they have they have to put that up
 
01:31:44.770 --> 01:31:44.780 align:start position:0%
that's the payback that
 
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
yeah and so you might want to look at
 
01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
what North Carolina has on the web it's
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
just North Carolina Charter School
 
01:31:54.490 --> 01:31:54.500 align:start position:0%
dissolution I think you should hit it
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
but that is certainly an issue which
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
that committee is looking at but if if a
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
school can do this
 
01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
then why would they not be allowed to
 
01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
receive some support building Aid as
 
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.689 --> 01:32:11.699 align:start position:0%
so they're they're they're putting up
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know are all these 501c3s
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know the answer to that
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:26.209 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah right and so there is information
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
um in secretary state's office under
 
01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:34.490 align:start position:0%
um in secretary state's office under
non-profits

01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
non-profits
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
um annual reports filed by all those uh
 
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.689 --> 01:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
so let's take a little break here but um
 
01:32:53.689 --> 01:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
we we've raised some questions that when
 
01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
we meet again we're going to try and get
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
some answers coming in on on the when
 
01:32:59.330 --> 01:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
the the men's one you mentioned this
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
right now Mel
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
dissolution and the ability to pay off
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
that debt
 
01:33:05.159 --> 01:33:05.870 align:start position:0%
that debt
um

01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:08.689 --> 01:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
so what we need to do is let them come
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
in and put this thing together uh let's
 
01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
just take a break and come back at about
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
five minutes of 11 I think that that's
 
01:33:17.629 --> 01:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
when they said they'd have about ready
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll tap in with uh ACS at that
 
01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:23.450 align:start position:0%
and we'll tap in with uh ACS at that
time

01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:38.169 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:33:38.169 --> 01:33:38.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.179 --> 01:33:39.790 align:start position:0%
 
LSR

01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
LSR
 
01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a guy that called my wife
 
01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:45.659 align:start position:0%
and and uh from I didn't add in that
 
01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
last yeah I can send that to you what
 
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
I've got
 
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
LSR okay the Newberry plan
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
so I don't know maybe if we show them
 
01:34:00.360 --> 02:00:08.390 align:start position:0%
so I don't know maybe if we show them
your

02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
I think if you go ahead and turn on your
 
02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
microphone yeah
 
02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
hear you oh okay that's all I had to do
 
02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
hear you oh okay that's all I had to do
yes

02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay folks here at the committee we
 
02:00:22.370 --> 02:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
have here
 
02:00:26.030 --> 02:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
um we have ECS and Joe Moore is here
 
02:00:29.209 --> 02:00:29.219 align:start position:0%
with us from ECS he's right there on the
 
02:00:29.219 --> 02:00:30.950 align:start position:0%
with us from ECS he's right there on the
screen

02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
screen
 
02:00:34.089 --> 02:00:34.099 align:start position:0%
um I'm Rick Ladd for folks at your end
 
02:00:37.010 --> 02:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
I'm chairing the education committee
 
02:00:39.890 --> 02:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
here and we're in the process of looking
 
02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:41.629 align:start position:0%
here and we're in the process of looking
at

02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:00:43.609 --> 02:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
um School building Aid
 
02:00:46.490 --> 02:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
and our formula in New Hampshire
 
02:00:48.490 --> 02:00:48.500 align:start position:0%
is one of which
 
02:00:52.609 --> 02:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
it needs real good look uh we're not
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
able to fund the buildings that we need
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
to fund uh currently under that model uh
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
we we have with us today Amy Clark who
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
is from doe she is an engineer that's
 
02:01:10.370 --> 02:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
very familiar with the program and with
 
02:01:12.109 --> 02:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
the statutes associated with school
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
building aid but what we're looking at
 
02:01:17.209 --> 02:01:17.219 align:start position:0%
is try and find out are there any other
 
02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
states out there that might have some a
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
different way of funding this this uh
 
02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
real need for having facilities that
 
02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
reflect what we require for instruction
 
02:01:33.410 --> 02:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
and curriculum in our classrooms we have
 
02:01:35.570 --> 02:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
a number of buildings in our state which
 
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
are well over 50 years old and some I
 
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
hear one down in Berlin here which which
 
02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh represents from that's 90 how many
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
years old
 
02:01:50.570 --> 02:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
98 years old that's the building they're
 
02:01:54.770 --> 02:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
in so we we have a long way to go so
 
02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
so Joel if you could go ahead and and
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
help us out we'd appreciate it
 
02:02:02.209 --> 02:02:02.219 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you so much chill out
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
and thanks for the to the committee for
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
having us uh Chris they're able to get
 
02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
the PowerPoint up for us awesome well
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
just very briefly want to introduce ECS
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
to the folks who may not be familiar we
 
02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
are a national nonpartisan education
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
policy Center we were created through an
 
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
interstate compact back in the 1960s and
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
so we exist in all those State statutes
 
02:02:27.709 --> 02:02:27.719 align:start position:0%
around the country and our goal is to
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
help all policy makers in the State uh
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's the legislature or the
 
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
governor's office Department offices of
 
02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:36.659 align:start position:0%
fire education or Workforce Development
 
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
to create better policy that works for
 
02:02:41.689 --> 02:02:41.699 align:start position:0%
them again we are non-partisan and
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
non-advocacy so we're not coming at this
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
with any particular angle or telling you
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
how to look at any of the information
 
02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
average State obviously has its own
 
02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
context and you have that best for New
 
02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we can't tell you what the
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
other 49 states are doing and what that
 
02:02:59.930 --> 02:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
looks like for them so how we do that
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
I've got a great policy team here that
 
02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
follows every Bill and every rule of
 
02:03:07.490 --> 02:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
Regulation he comes out of Departments
 
02:03:09.890 --> 02:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
of Education around the country we track
 
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
those compile them and regularly release
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
research and reports one of those uh
 
02:03:16.490 --> 02:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
that we're here to talk about today my
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
colleague Chris duncombe has recently
 
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
completed a 50-state comparison on how
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
States fund School Capital Construction
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
so I will turn it over to Chris for that
 
02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:28.430 align:start position:0%
so I will turn it over to Chris for that
conversation

02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
thank you John thank you chairman live
 
02:03:32.810 --> 02:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
can you hear me all right uh you're
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
coming in fine at this end
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
great perfect Powell thank you all for
 
02:03:39.530 --> 02:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
having me here today us talk State
 
02:03:43.810 --> 02:03:43.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
no I was just asking another member to
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
sit down where he could see the screen
 
02:03:51.890 --> 02:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
great well thank you all for having me
 
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
here today this is a topic that we've
 
02:03:58.609 --> 02:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of interests recently from
 
02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
State leaders so happy to share some of
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
our recent research on this topic area
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
people tend to think of school
 
02:04:06.890 --> 02:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
facilities as largely just a local
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility but states can and do
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
play a significant role in building a
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
maintaining school facilities so today
 
02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to touch on a few topic areas
 
02:04:18.589 --> 02:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
first is just some initial context I'm
 
02:04:19.850 --> 02:04:19.860 align:start position:0%
going to provide some background on
 
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
revenues and who pays for school
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
construction and how New Hampshire
 
02:04:25.250 --> 02:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
compares to other states
 
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
then I'll share findings from the
 
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
research we completed that Joel
 
02:04:30.649 --> 02:04:30.659 align:start position:0%
mentioned on our first 50 state in
 
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
comparison on K-12 School construction
 
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
and the types of financial assistance
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
that states provide as well as going
 
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
through some of the key design choices
 
02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
that states have in determining that
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
financial assistance and then finally
 
02:04:47.209 --> 02:04:47.219 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd um in our initial
 
02:04:49.129 --> 02:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
conversation the herds and interests and
 
02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
allocation methods so I'm going to
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
provide a couple State examples that may
 
02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
be helpful as you're looking to
 
02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:56.589 align:start position:0%
be helpful as you're looking to
um

02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:58.850 --> 02:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
perhaps change our model in New
 
02:04:58.860 --> 02:05:01.490 align:start position:0%
perhaps change our model in New
Hampshire

02:05:01.490 --> 02:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.410 --> 02:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
so in terms of
 
02:05:07.010 --> 02:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources nationally as you all
 
02:05:08.810 --> 02:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
are probably familiar state governments
 
02:05:10.370 --> 02:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
are the largest source of operating key
 
02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
College support they surpass local
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
governments in the 1980s
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
States play uh smaller but still a
 
02:05:18.290 --> 02:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
significant role in K-12 Capital
 
02:05:21.649 --> 02:05:21.659 align:start position:0%
expenditures they contribute 22 of all
 
02:05:23.570 --> 02:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
costs which is equal to an average
 
02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
annual outlay of 54 billion dollars
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll notice if you see the time
 
02:05:31.129 --> 02:05:31.139 align:start position:0%
periods on the slide that for Capital
 
02:05:33.050 --> 02:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
expenditures that's average over an 11
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
period 11-year period and that's because
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
Capital expenses are much more important
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
to variation and I'll go into that in a
 
02:05:41.570 --> 02:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail soon
 
02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
um so it's average over a longer period
 
02:05:45.649 --> 02:05:45.659 align:start position:0%
so it's not skewed by one particular
 
02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
year of large or no investment
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
there's also a substantial state to
 
02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
state variation so State context really
 
02:05:55.490 --> 02:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
does matter for example 10 states
 
02:05:58.010 --> 02:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
provide more than 50 percent of capital
 
02:06:00.350 --> 02:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
costs and that includes New Hampshire
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
and many of you are New England
 
02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
neighbors including Connecticut Maine
 
02:06:07.930 --> 02:06:07.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:10.739 align:start position:0%
meanwhile other states provide less than
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
that and some states provided no Capital
 
02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
Construction Aid and it was required
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
entirely a local responsibility
 
02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:19.970 align:start position:0%
entirely a local responsibility
um

02:06:19.970 --> 02:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:22.609 --> 02:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
so it really does vary for New Hampshire
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
to show the data on Revenue sources
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is somewhat unique in that
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
on the operating side most of the
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
revenue sources come from local sources
 
02:06:35.870 --> 02:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
and this local Reliance is likely due
 
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
back New Hampshire does not collect or
 
02:06:39.890 --> 02:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
personal income tax on wages or salaries
 
02:06:43.070 --> 02:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
or state by general sales tax the state
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
does play a larger role in funding
 
02:06:47.689 --> 02:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures the state funded
 
02:06:49.729 --> 02:06:49.739 align:start position:0%
over half of the capital costs from 2009
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
to 2019 and that compares quite
 
02:06:54.410 --> 02:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
favorably to the National Data I shared
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
on the previous slide showing that
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
states on average provided just 22
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
percent of the costs
 
02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:02.820 align:start position:0%
the data if you're interested in is from
 
02:07:04.430 --> 02:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
from the operating side is on National
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
Center of Education statistics on the
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
capital side is from the 21st century
 
02:07:10.609 --> 02:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
School fund state of our schools report
 
02:07:13.970 --> 02:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
and I have that linked and the resources
 
02:07:15.649 --> 02:07:15.659 align:start position:0%
slide at the end of this presentation if
 
02:07:17.089 --> 02:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
you're interested in getting more
 
02:07:18.770 --> 02:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
information on
 
02:07:22.070 --> 02:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
um funding and funding sources
 
02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
funding does not only vary from state to
 
02:07:26.330 --> 02:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
state but it also varies over time
 
02:07:28.609 --> 02:07:28.619 align:start position:0%
Capital Construction funding is very
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
volatile the graph I have on the slide
 
02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
provides inflation adjusted data from
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
U.S census bureaus and your service will
 
02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
system finances the performance of the
 
02:07:40.910 --> 02:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
economy results in much larger swings in
 
02:07:42.770 --> 02:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
capital funding from both States and
 
02:07:44.510 --> 02:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
local governments compared to operating
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
expenses on facility maintenance that
 
02:07:50.089 --> 02:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
you see in the slide following the 0709
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
reception Capital expenditures dropped
 
02:07:55.370 --> 02:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
26 percent while maintenance and
 
02:07:57.410 --> 02:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
operation support climbed to six percent
 
02:07:59.689 --> 02:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
and so that's not to say that in a six
 
02:08:01.689 --> 02:08:01.699 align:start position:0%
percent decline isn't is nothing
 
02:08:03.890 --> 02:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
distracting a significant budgetary
 
02:08:06.290 --> 02:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
impacts but it's not the more extreme
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
variation that occurs on the capital
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
spending side
 
02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
similarly during more recent economic
 
02:08:14.810 --> 02:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
growth Capital expenditures have
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
increased dramatically and part of the
 
02:08:18.589 --> 02:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
reason why I think we've heard so much
 
02:08:20.209 --> 02:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
from State leaders on this topic area
 
02:08:23.450 --> 02:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
Rising 27 or maintenance and operations
 
02:08:27.169 --> 02:08:27.179 align:start position:0%
supporting the stayed fairly stable
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I provide this information just as
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
for financial planning note especially
 
02:08:33.649 --> 02:08:33.659 align:start position:0%
with concerns about a fiscal flip with
 
02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
the exploration of federal relief
 
02:08:38.030 --> 02:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
dollars and um potential for the
 
02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
downturn of the economy at some point
 
02:08:43.370 --> 02:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
so going into the research that we've
 
02:08:45.890 --> 02:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
completed at ECS
 
02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
um we provide these uh 50 state
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
comparisons to give leaders on a
 
02:08:52.970 --> 02:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
national landscape on what we kind of
 
02:08:54.770 --> 02:08:54.780 align:start position:0%
identify as some of the key decision
 
02:08:57.530 --> 02:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
points this is the first year we've done
 
02:08:59.930 --> 02:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
the Capital Construction 50 state
 
02:09:02.570 --> 02:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
comparison so if there's any gaps that
 
02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
you identify if you get a chance to take
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
a look at the database to the
 
02:09:07.550 --> 02:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
information I share today we're
 
02:09:09.290 --> 02:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
certainly open to suggestions and we're
 
02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:15.649 --> 02:09:15.659 align:start position:0%
from a high level we found that 90 of
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
states provide some rule in supporting
 
02:09:19.850 --> 02:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
School construction either through
 
02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
appropriating funds directly to
 
02:09:23.570 --> 02:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
districts or by writing some type of
 
02:09:25.430 --> 02:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
financing support
 
02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
the research also made clear that state
 
02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
leaders have a lot of different
 
02:09:30.589 --> 02:09:30.599 align:start position:0%
decisions to consider in providing that
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
support such as how to prioritize
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
projects whether there's a dedicated
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue Source in the state or a
 
02:09:41.930 --> 02:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
separate Authority finances projects if
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
voter approval is required for standard
 
02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
local debt issuance or if there's an
 
02:09:49.250 --> 02:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
incentive for consolidation projects and
 
02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
this diversity funding approaches does
 
02:09:53.209 --> 02:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
create an opportunity for states to
 
02:09:54.830 --> 02:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
potentially learn from one another and
 
02:09:56.689 --> 02:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
that's what we hope this 50 state
 
02:09:58.850 --> 02:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
convinced and can be helpful in doing we
 
02:10:01.450 --> 02:10:01.460 align:start position:0%
have the full databases on our website
 
02:10:04.070 --> 02:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
acs.org and we're happy to share any
 
02:10:05.629 --> 02:10:05.639 align:start position:0%
data points of interest directly with
 
02:10:09.050 --> 02:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
before going further I didn't want to
 
02:10:13.370 --> 02:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the the differences and
 
02:10:15.229 --> 02:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
the terms that I'm using when I say
 
02:10:18.050 --> 02:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
Appropriations uh and financing support
 
02:10:20.810 --> 02:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
Appropriations refer to funds
 
02:10:22.609 --> 02:10:22.619 align:start position:0%
distributed to school districts often
 
02:10:24.589 --> 02:10:24.599 align:start position:0%
through a categorical grant program
 
02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
outside of their primary funding formula
 
02:10:28.430 --> 02:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
and these dollars can be used for
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
upfront costs or paying off locally
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
issued debt
 
02:10:33.649 --> 02:10:33.659 align:start position:0%
that distinction here as the state does
 
02:10:35.570 --> 02:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
not require repayment
 
02:10:38.209 --> 02:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
financing support is State assistance
 
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
that can take the form of bond issuance
 
02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing locally issued bonds or
 
02:10:44.810 --> 02:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
loaning money to districts from a state
 
02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
revolving Loan Fund and the distinction
 
02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
being the state requires full or partial
 
02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:51.830 align:start position:0%
being the state requires full or partial
repayment

02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
repayment
 
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
in terms of what we found
 
02:10:56.689 --> 02:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
but we've got that 10 states provide and
 
02:10:59.450 --> 02:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
I will note that this is based upon our
 
02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
view of statutory language and the most
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
recently enacted budget so let's not say
 
02:11:04.199 --> 02:11:05.330 align:start position:0%
recently enacted budget so let's not say
that

02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:06.649 --> 02:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
um states have not done things
 
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
differently in the past but this is what
 
02:11:10.609 --> 02:11:10.619 align:start position:0%
we found from current policy we found
 
02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
that 10 states provide Appropriations
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
but do not provide financing support as
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
you see on the slide
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
seven states and DC provide financing
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
but do not appropriate funds directly to
 
02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:24.709 align:start position:0%
but do not appropriate funds directly to
districts

02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
and 28 States including New Hampshire
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
provide both Appropriations and
 
02:11:31.729 --> 02:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
financing support
 
02:11:34.729 --> 02:11:34.739 align:start position:0%
and five states that we identified for
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
the most recently enacted budget did not
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
provide either so overall that's 90
 
02:11:40.669 --> 02:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
percent of States providing some form of
 
02:11:45.649 --> 02:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.810 --> 02:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
going into some of the design choices
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
that we we flagged as potentially of
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
Interest as states are looking to design
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
their school construction Aid one of the
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
most important roles that we thought in
 
02:11:59.450 --> 02:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
the state who play in this is to try to
 
02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
equalize wealth disparities across
 
02:12:03.470 --> 02:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
districts it's the same with operational
 
02:12:05.629 --> 02:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
funding the state can play role in
 
02:12:07.550 --> 02:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
equalizer and supporting Federal Capital
 
02:12:09.890 --> 02:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
Construction costs and they do that by
 
02:12:13.070 --> 02:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
Factory and local ability to pay States
 
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
use this factored prioritize which
 
02:12:17.810 --> 02:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
projects or receiving funds the amount
 
02:12:20.089 --> 02:12:20.099 align:start position:0%
that they're eligible to receive or both
 
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the
 
02:12:24.530 --> 02:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
um has an index that
 
02:12:24.540 --> 02:12:27.890 align:start position:0%
um has an index that
the

02:12:27.890 --> 02:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
what is the name of that index sorry the
 
02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:31.070 align:start position:0%
what is the name of that index sorry the
wealthy

02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
wealthy
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
um you're the only main factor as an
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
equal evaluation for people and median
 
02:12:38.570 --> 02:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
income included in it so you all do have
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
a ability to pay a lot of States take a
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
few variety of approaches in this the
 
02:12:45.890 --> 02:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
most common is an assessed property
 
02:12:48.109 --> 02:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
value per student which is included in
 
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
your school building in Factor
 
02:12:53.089 --> 02:12:53.099 align:start position:0%
almost every state with wealth
 
02:12:55.129 --> 02:12:55.139 align:start position:0%
Equalization as this included as at
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
least an element of their local ability
 
02:12:58.729 --> 02:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
to pay measure
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
States also factor in a few other items
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
such as household income New Hampshire
 
02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
as median household income or childhood
 
02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
poverty rates for the percentage of
 
02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:09.599 align:start position:0%
students receiving free or lose price
 
02:13:12.649 --> 02:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
meals levels of deadiness compared to
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
property values unemployment rates
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
and Nevada factors in declining property
 
02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
another key decision that we saw in
 
02:13:28.970 --> 02:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
designing this Aid is
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
um to deal with the volatility that I
 
02:13:33.290 --> 02:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
shared earlier some states made dedicate
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
funding for school construction other
 
02:13:38.209 --> 02:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
than General funds as general funds may
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
not be dedicated to school construction
 
02:13:43.370 --> 02:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
and tough Economic Times as as there may
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
be more pressing and immediate needs
 
02:13:47.870 --> 02:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
that require the use of those funds so
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
one strategy is to try to provide some
 
02:13:52.129 --> 02:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
stability by dedicating a revenue Source
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
we identified 19 states that have a
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
dedicated Revenue source
 
02:13:59.870 --> 02:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
the most common being Lottery proceeds
 
02:14:02.569 --> 02:14:02.579 align:start position:0%
or taxes on Casino gaming six states
 
02:14:05.209 --> 02:14:05.219 align:start position:0%
that we identified did that states may
 
02:14:07.850 --> 02:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
also use a sales and use tax as another
 
02:14:09.970 --> 02:14:09.980 align:start position:0%
common source and this could be
 
02:14:12.169 --> 02:14:12.179 align:start position:0%
dedicating the state share our local
 
02:14:14.930 --> 02:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
share of sales tax states may also
 
02:14:17.450 --> 02:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
provide a local option to raise sales
 
02:14:19.850 --> 02:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
tax for school construction I don't have
 
02:14:22.669 --> 02:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
them on this slide but both Virginia and
 
02:14:25.609 --> 02:14:25.619 align:start position:0%
Georgia have that as an option
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
other common Revenue sources include
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
Severance taxes on natural resources for
 
02:14:34.209 --> 02:14:34.219 align:start position:0%
a lot of the energy rich States or
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
revenue from tax assignment or marijuana
 
02:14:39.530 --> 02:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
sales whether that's medical or
 
02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:41.510 align:start position:0%
sales whether that's medical or
recreational

02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
and the last examples being
 
02:14:47.209 --> 02:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
um fees collected from either licensing
 
02:14:50.510 --> 02:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
fees or on criminal fines fees and poor
 
02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:54.950 align:start position:0%
fees or on criminal fines fees and poor
pictures

02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:56.810 --> 02:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
another challenge facing school
 
02:14:58.850 --> 02:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
districts is maintaining too many rather
 
02:15:01.850 --> 02:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
than too few school facilities given
 
02:15:03.709 --> 02:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
that changing demographics across the
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
country it's also being experienced in
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with declining student
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
populations this is an increasing
 
02:15:12.410 --> 02:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
challenge we identified 29 states that
 
02:15:14.750 --> 02:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
provide a financial incentive for
 
02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
the most common was some type of a whole
 
02:15:23.030 --> 02:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
harmless Vision usually that last thing
 
02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
one to five years saying that
 
02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
Consolidated District can't get less per
 
02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
student than they would have received if
 
02:15:31.370 --> 02:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
the two districts had remained separate
 
02:15:34.370 --> 02:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
states also prioritize and provide
 
02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:36.169 align:start position:0%
states also prioritize and provide
additional

02:15:36.169 --> 02:15:36.179 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:15:39.770 --> 02:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
um dollars for construction projects New
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire provides additional for
 
02:15:42.830 --> 02:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
student dollar applications for
 
02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts so not
 
02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
Consolidated but districts that are
 
02:15:49.729 --> 02:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
sharing services
 
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
some states may also provide an
 
02:15:54.649 --> 02:15:54.659 align:start position:0%
additional weight through their formula
 
02:15:57.709 --> 02:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:01.490 --> 02:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
another example that we saw was States
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
offering the lower of the two ability to
 
02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
pay measures for the two consolidating
 
02:16:08.689 --> 02:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
districts so the state would take on a
 
02:16:10.609 --> 02:16:10.619 align:start position:0%
larger share of costs for a certain
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
period usually similar to Lasting as the
 
02:16:14.990 --> 02:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
whole harmless policies
 
02:16:18.109 --> 02:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
and Arizona is unique and they have
 
02:16:19.729 --> 02:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
different local Revenue limits for
 
02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:25.609 --> 02:16:25.619 align:start position:0%
another approach that states have taken
 
02:16:27.530 --> 02:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire is to establish
 
02:16:29.149 --> 02:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
a separate authority to provide
 
02:16:31.490 --> 02:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
oversight and management of debt
 
02:16:33.889 --> 02:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
specific to school construction and to
 
02:16:36.530 --> 02:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
issue debt that is not at the full faith
 
02:16:38.030 --> 02:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
and credit of the state
 
02:16:41.209 --> 02:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
we identify at least 16 States and not
 
02:16:41.219 --> 02:16:41.990 align:start position:0%
we identify at least 16 States and not
all

02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:16:44.450 --> 02:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
um authorities provide full-facing
 
02:16:47.089 --> 02:16:47.099 align:start position:0%
credit outside of the state but some do
 
02:16:49.849 --> 02:16:49.859 align:start position:0%
we identified at least 16 states that
 
02:16:51.049 --> 02:16:51.059 align:start position:0%
have established these authorities
 
02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire school building
 
02:16:52.679 --> 02:16:53.990 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire school building
authority

02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
authority
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
other states provide financing support
 
02:16:59.450 --> 02:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
do so through uh department at the state
 
02:17:01.310 --> 02:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
typically in Department of Revenue or
 
02:17:04.370 --> 02:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer
 
02:17:06.110 --> 02:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
and other states just have local
 
02:17:10.730 --> 02:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
some of the takeaways in doing this
 
02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
research that I wanted to share for the
 
02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
trend of those those High effort states
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
that we saw
 
02:17:22.129 --> 02:17:22.139 align:start position:0%
um based on the state that are spending
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
the most from the 21st century School
 
02:17:26.509 --> 02:17:26.519 align:start position:0%
funds database and what we found in our
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
research the states being Alaska
 
02:17:32.690 --> 02:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts New Jersey Ohio Wyoming is
 
02:17:36.290 --> 02:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
that they steered some common features
 
02:17:38.929 --> 02:17:38.939 align:start position:0%
they typically have a grant that's
 
02:17:40.669 --> 02:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
available District that takes into local
 
02:17:42.410 --> 02:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
ability to pay
 
02:17:44.750 --> 02:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
the state issues bonds to finance
 
02:17:47.450 --> 02:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
projects at lower interest costs and
 
02:17:49.370 --> 02:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
districts would be able to obtain on
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
their own and some have established a
 
02:17:53.810 --> 02:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
separate financing Authority and then
 
02:17:56.030 --> 02:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
finally a dedicated Revenue to provide
 
02:17:58.910 --> 02:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
some some stability prepared to general
 
02:18:04.669 --> 02:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:06.599 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to go into the last topic
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
here and then happy to have more of a
 
02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:10.009 align:start position:0%
here and then happy to have more of a
session

02:18:10.009 --> 02:18:10.019 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:18:10.019 --> 02:18:10.730 align:start position:0%
session
um

02:18:10.730 --> 02:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of allocation methods a state
 
02:18:14.750 --> 02:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
allocation approaches can be really
 
02:18:17.810 --> 02:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
quite complex some states have multiple
 
02:18:19.250 --> 02:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
grants with very different approaches
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
that add to that complexity so in effort
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
to simplify a PlayStation purchase into
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
really large categories allocations that
 
02:18:29.570 --> 02:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
are driven by formula and allocations
 
02:18:31.009 --> 02:18:31.019 align:start position:0%
that are driven by an application
 
02:18:31.019 --> 02:18:32.330 align:start position:0%
that are driven by an application
process

02:18:32.330 --> 02:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
formula allocations are specifics are
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
specified in state law or the state
 
02:18:40.129 --> 02:18:40.139 align:start position:0%
budget in our 50-state comparison we
 
02:18:42.349 --> 02:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
identified a variety of formula driven
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
allocations the states May factor in
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
local ability to pay which I had
 
02:18:48.349 --> 02:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously and those are
 
02:18:51.250 --> 02:18:51.260 align:start position:0%
typically identified by formula
 
02:18:55.370 --> 02:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
States may also distribute or determine
 
02:18:57.530 --> 02:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
how much funding is available for a
 
02:18:59.530 --> 02:18:59.540 align:start position:0%
particular projects based on formula
 
02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
that may factor in enrollment of some
 
02:19:06.969 --> 02:19:06.979 align:start position:0%
number of students that are served by a
 
02:19:10.250 --> 02:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
project that is being proposed they may
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
also factor in square footage of the
 
02:19:15.469 --> 02:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
project or cost per square footage
 
02:19:18.410 --> 02:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
they can be quite simple in Idaho a
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
single dollar amount is allocated per
 
02:19:22.370 --> 02:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
student to all districts based on their
 
02:19:25.009 --> 02:19:25.019 align:start position:0%
attendance counts or they can be quite
 
02:19:27.530 --> 02:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
complex Maryland's capital Improvement
 
02:19:30.530 --> 02:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
program allocates Aid on enrollment
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
projections Baseline square footage cost
 
02:19:37.549 --> 02:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:39.650 --> 02:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
States also allocate funds based on
 
02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
competitive application process and this
 
02:19:44.330 --> 02:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
is where the state designates an agency
 
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
or a separate body to review
 
02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
applications and award funds the review
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
process can have a degree of
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
subjectivity in which the reviewing body
 
02:19:58.250 --> 02:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
has is given a list of priorities and is
 
02:19:59.929 --> 02:19:59.939 align:start position:0%
told to allocate funds based on those
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
priorities or you can have a more
 
02:20:04.849 --> 02:20:04.859 align:start position:0%
objective clearly defined scoring
 
02:20:07.370 --> 02:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
processes and I'll offer a few State
 
02:20:10.190 --> 02:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
examples that I've seen in doing the
 
02:20:13.969 --> 02:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
database North Carolina is one example
 
02:20:16.190 --> 02:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
they have two separate Grant programs
 
02:20:18.889 --> 02:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
both funded by Lottery revenues
 
02:20:20.929 --> 02:20:20.939 align:start position:0%
you know first the public school Capital
 
02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
funds is a program funded annually with
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars from Lottery
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
revenues that's required in the state
 
02:20:31.010 --> 02:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
statute that deposit and is allocated to
 
02:20:33.050 --> 02:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
all the school districts in the state
 
02:20:35.929 --> 02:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
and is based off solely on average daily
 
02:20:35.939 --> 02:20:37.130 align:start position:0%
and is based off solely on average daily
membership

02:20:37.130 --> 02:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
membership
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
they also have a needs-based capital
 
02:20:43.309 --> 02:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
funds and districts must apply to
 
02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
receive these grants the eligibility to
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
receive them is based on assessed
 
02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
property values the adjusted market
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
value taxable property must be less than
 
02:20:56.570 --> 02:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
40 billion dollars to be eligible
 
02:20:59.690 --> 02:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
and in that application process the
 
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
north the North Carolina Department Of
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
Destruction reviews applications and
 
02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
prioritize based on a set list of
 
02:21:09.010 --> 02:21:09.020 align:start position:0%
criteria that includes debt tax ratios
 
02:21:11.450 --> 02:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
whether the project is addressing
 
02:21:13.490 --> 02:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
critical deficiencies and adequately
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
serving student populations whether it's
 
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
a consolidation project whether the
 
02:21:20.450 --> 02:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
district has received one of these
 
02:21:22.250 --> 02:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
commands previously and a few other
 
02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:26.030 align:start position:0%
commands previously and a few other
criteria

02:21:26.030 --> 02:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:28.610 --> 02:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
another example is New Mexico New Mexico
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
created a council to assist districts in
 
02:21:33.530 --> 02:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
applying for Construction Grants and to
 
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
review and award funds membership on the
 
02:21:39.650 --> 02:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
council is specified in statute has nine
 
02:21:42.130 --> 02:21:42.140 align:start position:0%
members includes the governor the SUV
 
02:21:44.690 --> 02:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
superintendent of Public Instruction and
 
02:21:46.550 --> 02:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
a variety of executive and legislative
 
02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:48.170 align:start position:0%
a variety of executive and legislative
appointments

02:21:48.170 --> 02:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
the council has a more sophisticated
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
approach for awarding funds than I don't
 
02:21:55.550 --> 02:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
know maybe not sophisticated is the
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
a more formulated approach to awarding
 
02:22:04.490 --> 02:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
funds they rely on a facilities
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
assessment database to prioritize
 
02:22:10.429 --> 02:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
applications this database is populated
 
02:22:12.050 --> 02:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
with information that is gathered
 
02:22:14.510 --> 02:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
through Capital master plan submitted by
 
02:22:16.490 --> 02:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
districts to the state and by field
 
02:22:18.590 --> 02:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
assessments to determine School
 
02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
efficiencies the council uses the
 
02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:22.550 align:start position:0%
efficiencies the council uses the
applications

02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
applications
 
02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:23.450 align:start position:0%
applications
um

02:22:23.450 --> 02:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:25.250 --> 02:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
based on the information collected in
 
02:22:27.410 --> 02:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
the database to create a facility index
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
condition and that index ranks all the
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
project applications and that is how
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
they determine how to award funds so I
 
02:22:35.929 --> 02:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
would say this is a slightly more
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
rigorous application-based approach
 
02:22:40.429 --> 02:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave you with some of the
 
02:22:44.090 --> 02:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
resources that I've mentioned and also
 
02:22:46.370 --> 02:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
send this also to the subcommittee so
 
02:22:48.410 --> 02:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
that you have all the access to all this
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
information and thank you for helping me
 
02:22:52.910 --> 02:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
go through these slides and I'm happy to
 
02:22:55.010 --> 02:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
have a bit more of a conversation
 
02:22:56.929 --> 02:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much Chris that's
 
02:22:59.809 --> 02:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
informative it's it's a broad picture
 
02:22:59.819 --> 02:23:01.790 align:start position:0%
informative it's it's a broad picture
uh

02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:04.010 --> 02:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
right now from the committee are there
 
02:23:07.610 --> 02:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
any questions or need for additional
 
02:23:08.990 --> 02:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
information you may have heard from
 
02:23:13.550 --> 02:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:15.770 --> 02:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
I I have a question just to start out
 
02:23:20.090 --> 02:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
with um under the allocation method she
 
02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned that Idaho
 
02:23:25.010 --> 02:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
as a single dollar amount which they
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
allocate each year based upon must be
 
02:23:30.410 --> 02:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
average daily membership fit in
 
02:23:32.690 --> 02:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
residence or something such as that
 
02:23:35.690 --> 02:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
how do they take into account
 
02:23:37.969 --> 02:23:37.979 align:start position:0%
but how would they take into account the
 
02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
needs that a high school may have need
 
02:23:43.250 --> 02:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
for more space more square footage than
 
02:23:46.370 --> 02:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
than a grade school
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
so so
 
02:23:50.690 --> 02:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
we've had some discussion regarding
 
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
funding based upon population student
 
02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:56.030 align:start position:0%
funding based upon population student
enrollment

02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
02:23:56.040 --> 02:23:57.469 align:start position:0%
enrollment
um

02:23:57.469 --> 02:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:01.849 --> 02:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
I I guess the question is has that
 
02:24:04.429 --> 02:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
allocation process run into any problems
 
02:24:07.130 --> 02:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
with the needs of specific buildings for
 
02:24:09.770 --> 02:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
different age levels
 
02:24:11.389 --> 02:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
um that's a great question and we did
 
02:24:15.530 --> 02:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
see a lot of states that that factor in
 
02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
grade level and their application of
 
02:24:19.849 --> 02:24:19.859 align:start position:0%
project announced I can I can go through
 
02:24:22.130 --> 02:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
and grab a few examples of those States
 
02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
and provide them to Idaho actually has I
 
02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned one of their grants they have
 
02:24:29.330 --> 02:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
two grants that they provide that first
 
02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
grant is they allocated just on average
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
daily attendance they use attendance as
 
02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to enrollment account students
 
02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
so it's an attendance account and it's a
 
02:24:40.730 --> 02:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
flat amount so it does not vary based
 
02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
upon student grade level but they also
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
have a separate grant that is it's kind
 
02:24:48.050 --> 02:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
of similar to to North Carolina where I
 
02:24:49.250 --> 02:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned they have this enrollment
 
02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
driven and this needs based and then
 
02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
they also have a needs-based grant that
 
02:24:55.969 --> 02:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
is available to eligible districts I
 
02:24:57.770 --> 02:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
don't believe that Grant either takes
 
02:25:00.349 --> 02:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
into account grade level but that is a
 
02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
factor that some states have done
 
02:25:03.420 --> 02:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
factor that some states have done
um

02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:14.030 --> 02:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
seeing if I can find an example
 
02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
Arizona is a state that does that
 
02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:19.910 align:start position:0%
Arizona is a state that does that
Arkansas

02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
California

02:25:22.910 --> 02:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:25.010 align:start position:0%
 
Delaware

02:25:25.010 --> 02:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
Delaware
 
02:25:27.650 --> 02:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
Florida so there's there's quite a few
 
02:25:29.450 --> 02:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
examples of states that are taking into
 
02:25:31.550 --> 02:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
account grade level and it can provide
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
that complete list and additional
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
information on those states to members
 
02:25:39.410 --> 02:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
of the committee so that's basically
 
02:25:41.690 --> 02:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
you're you're talking about your average
 
02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
daily membership but they're also taking
 
02:25:45.530 --> 02:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
into account how many are in Middle
 
02:25:46.969 --> 02:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
School how near and Elementary School
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
how many are in the high school
 
02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
and taking up and so would they be
 
02:25:54.889 --> 02:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
funded at different levels based upon
 
02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
the school
 
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:07.969 --> 02:26:07.979 align:start position:0%
like we have about 32 percent of our
 
02:26:10.429 --> 02:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
kids are high school kids the remainder
 
02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
of course all k through eight
 
02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:13.969 align:start position:0%
of course all k through eight
yeah

02:26:13.969 --> 02:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:26:16.670 --> 02:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
um I I some states will have more
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
complex formulas so I don't think it's
 
02:26:20.889 --> 02:26:20.899 align:start position:0%
as straightforward as a single different
 
02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
dollar amount per grade level but but
 
02:26:27.469 --> 02:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
um it adjusts it isn't factored into the
 
02:26:31.370 --> 02:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
formula so it will eventually impact the
 
02:26:33.050 --> 02:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
the overall dollar amount that is
 
02:26:35.630 --> 02:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
allocated for a project
 
02:26:38.330 --> 02:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
um and States may also factor in grade
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.439 --> 02:26:46.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.370 --> 02:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
are there are there other questions for
 
02:26:52.250 --> 02:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
Chris right now yes represent dry
 
02:26:54.650 --> 02:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you that was really well presented
 
02:26:55.969 --> 02:26:55.979 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:26:58.250 --> 02:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
um do you take charter schools into
 
02:26:59.570 --> 02:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
account this because that's the reason
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're here today does that affect any of
 
02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:03.530 align:start position:0%
we're here today does that affect any of
these

02:27:03.530 --> 02:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
02:27:11.929 --> 02:27:11.939 align:start position:0%
um representative did you ask about
 
02:27:13.969 --> 02:27:13.979 align:start position:0%
charter schools and their eligibility to
 
02:27:16.309 --> 02:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
receive funds yeah how does that factor
 
02:27:20.570 --> 02:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:22.730 --> 02:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
um I've seen in some of states that are
 
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
explicit in charter schools are
 
02:27:27.230 --> 02:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
ineligible and some states where charter
 
02:27:31.250 --> 02:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:33.469 --> 02:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
um Oklahoma's Rosebud grants are an
 
02:27:33.479 --> 02:27:34.370 align:start position:0%
um Oklahoma's Rosebud grants are an
example

02:27:34.370 --> 02:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
um this is a grant program they
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
established recently that is funded
 
02:27:41.330 --> 02:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
through medical marijuana sales that's
 
02:27:43.610 --> 02:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
allocated to districts and as allocated
 
02:27:47.630 --> 02:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
off of their Equalization method and
 
02:27:49.370 --> 02:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
charter schools are eligible to receive
 
02:27:52.490 --> 02:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:54.290 --> 02:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
that is the one that came up in the
 
02:27:56.450 --> 02:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
database that we did but there may be
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
other state examples where Charters are
 
02:27:58.439 --> 02:27:59.510 align:start position:0%
other state examples where Charters are
eligible

02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
02:28:01.490 --> 02:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:03.650 --> 02:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative luno
 
02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and and
 
02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
thanks so much for uh for for presenting
 
02:28:10.250 --> 02:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
to us this morning
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
um is there a way that that we can also
 
02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:15.889 align:start position:0%
um is there a way that that we can also
um

02:28:15.889 --> 02:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:19.550 --> 02:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
have have an ability to compare New
 
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Charter Schools structure with
 
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools from other states
 
02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:24.889 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools from other states
because

02:28:24.889 --> 02:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:28:24.899 --> 02:28:25.670 align:start position:0%
because
um

02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:28.730 --> 02:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
um you know my my understanding is that
 
02:28:31.490 --> 02:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
is that New Hampshire has a has has very
 
02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:32.870 align:start position:0%
is that New Hampshire has a has has very
specific

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:34.429 align:start position:0%
specific
um

02:28:34.429 --> 02:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
um uh corporate structure surrounding
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
Charters that that may vary from you
 
02:28:41.270 --> 02:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
know maybe different from that of of of
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
other states and for example some
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
charters in New Hampshire can could be
 
02:28:50.690 --> 02:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
chartered by the local school district
 
02:28:52.730 --> 02:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
um we have none I think currently that
 
02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
fall into that category we have no
 
02:28:56.530 --> 02:28:56.540 align:start position:0%
Charter conversions
 
02:28:59.809 --> 02:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
none so so the charters that we do have
 
02:29:02.450 --> 02:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
are our private Corporation Charter
 
02:29:05.570 --> 02:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
Charters and um uh but their New
 
02:29:08.809 --> 02:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire corporations I believe
 
02:29:11.330 --> 02:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
um uh but but I think the charters in
 
02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are very different than
 
02:29:13.670 --> 02:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
for example the charters in
 
02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:15.469 align:start position:0%
for example the charters in
Massachusetts

02:29:15.469 --> 02:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
am I correct on that I I couldn't
 
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
compare it to Matt I don't know but yeah
 
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
but but I you know so so if we were to
 
02:29:25.790 --> 02:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
if we were to say look at how and I'm
 
02:29:27.710 --> 02:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
just picking for the sake of discussion
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
how Massachusetts funds
 
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
um building construction for for their
 
02:29:35.809 --> 02:29:35.819 align:start position:0%
Charters that might be different than
 
02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
than what New Hampshire does because of
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
the way their Charters are Incorporated
 
02:29:43.010 --> 02:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
um is there a way that we'd be able to
 
02:29:46.429 --> 02:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
to to be able to dig down to that level
 
02:29:48.170 --> 02:29:48.180 align:start position:0%
of detail and really understand what
 
02:29:50.809 --> 02:29:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:52.969 --> 02:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes that is a
 
02:29:55.130 --> 02:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
great question and Turner schools their
 
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
structure how they're authorized many of
 
02:29:59.330 --> 02:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
the policies varies upon state to state
 
02:30:02.330 --> 02:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
we do a 50-state comparison on charter
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
school policies that we completed fairly
 
02:30:07.010 --> 02:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
recently I can send that to you but I
 
02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
can also reach out to the author of that
 
02:30:12.290 --> 02:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
report to see if a particular State
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
jumped out to him in the completion of
 
02:30:16.490 --> 02:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
that report
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
um as a good comparison State as a state
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
that you're looking for a state that
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
does some has Charters organized
 
02:30:24.830 --> 02:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
similarly to New Hampshire
 
02:30:26.929 --> 02:30:26.939 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that would be that would be
 
02:30:29.090 --> 02:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
helpful but even ones that organize
 
02:30:29.100 --> 02:30:30.590 align:start position:0%
helpful but even ones that organize
differently

02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
differently
 
02:30:33.170 --> 02:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
um uh understanding what what components
 
02:30:35.290 --> 02:30:35.300 align:start position:0%
of their of their building aid program
 
02:30:39.290 --> 02:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
May rely on those the differences in
 
02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
those you know in those other states and
 
02:30:43.790 --> 02:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not we would we would want to
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
consider including those components or
 
02:30:49.490 --> 02:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
but I think that would all be very
 
02:30:51.359 --> 02:30:52.429 align:start position:0%
but I think that would all be very
helpful

02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
02:30:56.330 --> 02:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
if if the chair yes I'll just um as as
 
02:30:58.370 --> 02:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
context the information we have on
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
funding for charter schools in that
 
02:31:03.410 --> 02:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
report has information on how funding is
 
02:31:06.410 --> 02:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
determined who provides the funding does
 
02:31:08.450 --> 02:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
the state provide startup or planning
 
02:31:10.370 --> 02:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
grants and what kind of facilities
 
02:31:12.530 --> 02:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
funding is available so there is a
 
02:31:14.929 --> 02:31:14.939 align:start position:0%
facilities component in that as well
 
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
that would be great and I think for just
 
02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
for just for background I think there is
 
02:31:21.770 --> 02:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
a a study ongoing here in New Hampshire
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
with respect to uh to Charter
 
02:31:26.330 --> 02:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
dissolution because of their their their
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
private Corporation status and
 
02:31:31.730 --> 02:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know if that's the same
 
02:31:36.349 --> 02:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
as in other states but but how how would
 
02:31:38.570 --> 02:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
I mean you know I'm from the business
 
02:31:41.090 --> 02:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
background and contracts always seem to
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
be about not not not you know when the
 
02:31:45.650 --> 02:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
marriage is running great but when uh
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
when when things start to uh you know
 
02:31:50.330 --> 02:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
come to the end come to disintegrate and
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's when the contract language starts
 
02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh starts coming out but um but you know
 
02:31:57.050 --> 02:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
what what happens in that type of
 
02:31:59.090 --> 02:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
situation particularly with with
 
02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
investment of public money in um in
 
02:32:09.530 --> 02:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:12.650 --> 02:32:12.660 align:start position:0%
and you weren't here earlier today Dave
 
02:32:16.190 --> 02:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
but uh there is one state which we had
 
02:32:18.130 --> 02:32:18.140 align:start position:0%
uh Charter School disillusion
 
02:32:20.750 --> 02:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
information we didn't go into it today
 
02:32:22.849 --> 02:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
it's North Carolina okay great and they
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
have certain criteria that you have to
 
02:32:26.990 --> 02:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
have written into your Charter to before
 
02:32:29.450 --> 02:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
you're going to get this state loan or
 
02:32:32.690 --> 02:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
money right that's how that can be dealt
 
02:32:34.250 --> 02:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
with no that's that's that's that's
 
02:32:37.250 --> 02:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
that's excellent information Rick and uh
 
02:32:40.010 --> 02:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
and and I think that goes to what one of
 
02:32:41.450 --> 02:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
the things you were talking about during
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
the session too about about having you
 
02:32:46.130 --> 02:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
know specific information that's
 
02:32:49.250 --> 02:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
expected in these agreements that these
 
02:32:51.410 --> 02:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
Charters but also you know Co-op
 
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
agreements and things like that that
 
02:32:55.389 --> 02:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of standard to them
 
02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
yeah right now Chris one other area that
 
02:33:01.490 --> 02:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
we are hearing from our administrators
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
out in the school districts is that the
 
02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:06.469 align:start position:0%
out in the school districts is that the
predictability

02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
predictability
 
02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
of when I can receive these dollars is
 
02:33:13.070 --> 02:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
based upon of course legislation what we
 
02:33:16.130 --> 02:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
appropriate here annually or biannually
 
02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh this previous uh year we had and Amy
 
02:33:23.870 --> 02:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
you're here behind the screen but are
 
02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
you having that side we had 17 districts
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
applying for revenue from the state for
 
02:33:33.710 --> 02:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
building Aid we approved we've approved
 
02:33:35.809 --> 02:33:35.819 align:start position:0%
at this point to and possibly another
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
one coming
 
02:33:40.730 --> 02:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
but the issue is that these school
 
02:33:42.290 --> 02:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
districts in order to get an application
 
02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
into the department have to jump a lot
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
of Hoops Financial Hoops in terms of
 
02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
site plans architect fees all that and
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
of course they have to go to their local
 
02:33:56.929 --> 02:33:56.939 align:start position:0%
tax dot uh taxpayers the the person the
 
02:33:59.450 --> 02:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
community to raise those dollars and
 
02:34:01.010 --> 02:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
then they're one of those that didn't
 
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
get money this given year or this
 
02:34:07.490 --> 02:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
biennium uh uh so they're down 60 70 80
 
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
000 for the engineering fees it's
 
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
probably a whole lot more than that's
 
02:34:12.670 --> 02:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
probably three hundred thousand dollars
 
02:34:16.130 --> 02:34:16.140 align:start position:0%
and and so they never get reimbursed for
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
that uh seeing the projects are are just
 
02:34:21.230 --> 02:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
going on to the list the subsequent year
 
02:34:23.690 --> 02:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
and they may not be rated highly or not
 
02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of a crap shoot
 
02:34:30.410 --> 02:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
so predictability of resources to the
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
school districts really important
 
02:34:35.690 --> 02:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
so what we were looking at just in
 
02:34:38.750 --> 02:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
discussing earlier today is having a
 
02:34:41.150 --> 02:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
flat amount of money appropriated based
 
02:34:44.389 --> 02:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
upon a formula annually
 
02:34:47.090 --> 02:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
which would be then put into a state
 
02:34:49.309 --> 02:34:49.319 align:start position:0%
account and the school districts could
 
02:34:53.150 --> 02:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
not access that funding until such time
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
that they had their application approved
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
by the department and it dealt with
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
either renovation or construction
 
02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
and we also thought maybe it could be
 
02:35:07.389 --> 02:35:07.399 align:start position:0%
used also to pay off previous debt
 
02:35:10.610 --> 02:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
so are there any other states that have
 
02:35:12.130 --> 02:35:12.140 align:start position:0%
similar type
 
02:35:15.469 --> 02:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
logic towards owing to you know set up a
 
02:35:19.250 --> 02:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
formula and so I just mentioned
 
02:35:20.929 --> 02:35:20.939 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman yeah I was actually
 
02:35:23.570 --> 02:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
as we were talking thinking that having
 
02:35:26.330 --> 02:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
some guaranteed Grant amount could be
 
02:35:28.130 --> 02:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
approached to providing stability in
 
02:35:30.889 --> 02:35:30.899 align:start position:0%
addition to as I mentioned having a
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
designated Revenue Source other than
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
02:35:36.110 --> 02:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
um in terms of other states with that
 
02:35:39.170 --> 02:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
approach I mentioned Idaho has that flat
 
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
amount which I perhaps why you inquired
 
02:35:44.030 --> 02:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
about it you know again it's not a as
 
02:35:45.889 --> 02:35:45.899 align:start position:0%
sophisticated as what you're talking
 
02:35:48.170 --> 02:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
about in terms of differentiating by
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
need or School type
 
02:35:53.410 --> 02:35:53.420 align:start position:0%
um and I don't believe that money is
 
02:35:56.809 --> 02:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
held in a reserve account that is just
 
02:35:59.389 --> 02:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
allocated annually so that there is a
 
02:36:01.550 --> 02:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
Dependable source of some Revenue that's
 
02:36:04.490 --> 02:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
coming into districts
 
02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:05.270 align:start position:0%
coming into districts
um

02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:08.150 --> 02:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of other states that award
 
02:36:10.190 --> 02:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
funds without an application that's
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
required or prior to an application
 
02:36:21.170 --> 02:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:29.770 --> 02:36:29.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:32.090 --> 02:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
sorry it's just a lot of
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
information to store from 50 states and
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
very complex policies to have available
 
02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
on recall on a moment's notice um
 
02:36:42.650 --> 02:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
so they also use average daily
 
02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:44.210 align:start position:0%
so they also use average daily
attendance

02:36:44.210 --> 02:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
02:36:44.220 --> 02:36:54.950 align:start position:0%
attendance
um

02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
and it's just a hundred dollar payment
 
02:37:01.370 --> 02:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
based on Ada or average daily attendance
 
02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:11.389 align:start position:0%
based on Ada or average daily attendance
um

02:37:11.389 --> 02:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:13.550 --> 02:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
I can try to see if I can find another
 
02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
state that has an example that's kind of
 
02:37:17.389 --> 02:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
similar to what you're what you're
 
02:37:19.969 --> 02:37:19.979 align:start position:0%
describing maybe that as opposed to just
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
giving you all the states that factor in
 
02:37:23.809 --> 02:37:23.819 align:start position:0%
grade level I can look for another
 
02:37:26.090 --> 02:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
example that better matches what you're
 
02:37:28.849 --> 02:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
describing to me but
 
02:37:32.510 --> 02:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
um I do think that type of approach is
 
02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:33.230 align:start position:0%
um I do think that type of approach is
um

02:37:33.230 --> 02:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:35.929 --> 02:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
a logical one for trying to provide some
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
stability to districts so that they can
 
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
handle some of these initial costs for
 
02:37:44.030 --> 02:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
getting a project going
 
02:37:46.610 --> 02:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
especially if there's no certainty that
 
02:37:48.349 --> 02:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
they will receive approval from the
 
02:37:50.929 --> 02:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
state to be funded we did we did see
 
02:37:54.130 --> 02:37:54.140 align:start position:0%
that Tennessee had a program
 
02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
where it's similar to what I stated
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
right here where they have a certain
 
02:38:00.830 --> 02:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
amount of money which they allocate
 
02:38:04.429 --> 02:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
based upon their attendance plus also in
 
02:38:08.110 --> 02:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
the square footage uh per student per
 
02:38:10.610 --> 02:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
uh type of building they're in middle
 
02:38:12.530 --> 02:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
school high school
 
02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:14.150 align:start position:0%
school high school
um

02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:18.110 --> 02:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
also like to know what's the life cycle
 
02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh that they they they're expecting
 
02:38:22.910 --> 02:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
we've heard from Amy right here it's
 
02:38:25.730 --> 02:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
about 40 years uh is that pretty typical
 
02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
02:38:28.020 --> 02:38:30.170 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
um

02:38:30.170 --> 02:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
and how do how do we factor in things
 
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
like uh the fees and construct
 
02:38:40.929 --> 02:38:40.939 align:start position:0%
construction costs or uh debt retirement
 
02:38:48.650 --> 02:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:51.230 --> 02:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
big determined for debt retirement
 
02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:53.330 align:start position:0%
big determined for debt retirement
um

02:38:53.330 --> 02:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:56.150 --> 02:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
I believe that you are proposing was it
 
02:38:58.490 --> 02:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
20-year yes
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that 20 and 30 were the two that
 
02:39:04.250 --> 02:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
was the typical length that we saw in
 
02:39:06.770 --> 02:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
reviewing States so that would fall
 
02:39:08.990 --> 02:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
within that period
 
02:39:20.349 --> 02:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of life cycle analysis
 
02:39:25.969 --> 02:39:25.979 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we captured all of
 
02:39:29.389 --> 02:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
that through statutory language but in
 
02:39:32.389 --> 02:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
looking into New Mexico's example of the
 
02:39:35.570 --> 02:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
database that they use that index
 
02:39:39.050 --> 02:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
um does pull in information on life
 
02:39:41.389 --> 02:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
cycle analysis for the projects to
 
02:39:41.399 --> 02:39:42.590 align:start position:0%
cycle analysis for the projects to
determine

02:39:42.590 --> 02:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
determine
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
um whether it be more costly to replace
 
02:39:50.809 --> 02:39:50.819 align:start position:0%
or refurbish the school and so I think
 
02:39:52.849 --> 02:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
that perhaps providing more information
 
02:39:55.370 --> 02:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
out of that New Mexico's database
 
02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
information so you might be informative
 
02:39:59.150 --> 02:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
if you're interested in life cycle
 
02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:01.610 align:start position:0%
if you're interested in life cycle
information

02:40:01.610 --> 02:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:40:05.870 --> 02:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:08.090 --> 02:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
Amy do you have any questions or
 
02:40:10.190 --> 02:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts seeing that this is your your
 
02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:18.670 align:start position:0%
thoughts seeing that this is your your
Arena

02:40:18.670 --> 02:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:21.889 --> 02:40:21.899 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from from the
 
02:40:24.889 --> 02:40:24.899 align:start position:0%
committee yes Dave
 
02:40:26.809 --> 02:40:26.819 align:start position:0%
thanks very much Rick and and thanks
 
02:40:28.610 --> 02:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
again Chris and I may have missed this
 
02:40:30.889 --> 02:40:30.899 align:start position:0%
one when you were speaking
 
02:40:32.330 --> 02:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
um earlier
 
02:40:32.340 --> 02:40:34.130 align:start position:0%
um earlier
um

02:40:34.130 --> 02:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:37.370 --> 02:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
but are are any states
 
02:40:39.050 --> 02:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
um and that this is speaking generally
 
02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
to to building Aid
 
02:40:42.590 --> 02:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
um doing what New Hampshire is doing
 
02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
which is uh which is a uh you know all
 
02:40:47.330 --> 02:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
up front
 
02:40:47.340 --> 02:40:48.170 align:start position:0%
up front
um

02:40:48.170 --> 02:40:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
type payment to the school district
 
02:40:53.450 --> 02:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
or you were mentioning that a lot we're
 
02:40:56.750 --> 02:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
doing 20 and 30 year more 20-year
 
02:41:00.889 --> 02:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
yeah we identified
 
02:41:05.150 --> 02:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
um sorry I thank you representative we
 
02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
identified that states were either
 
02:41:09.889 --> 02:41:09.899 align:start position:0%
providing their Appropriations as a
 
02:41:12.110 --> 02:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
direct grant that helps cover upfront
 
02:41:15.230 --> 02:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
costs and that can be done all up front
 
02:41:18.110 --> 02:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
or over a series of payments
 
02:41:20.750 --> 02:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
um or as a debt reimbursement and it's
 
02:41:22.610 --> 02:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
pretty split
 
02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:25.130 align:start position:0%
pretty split
um

02:41:25.130 --> 02:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:28.490 --> 02:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
there were we found that it was actually
 
02:41:30.650 --> 02:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
Most states were using a direct Grant
 
02:41:33.170 --> 02:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
Aid or combination we found 25 States
 
02:41:34.969 --> 02:41:34.979 align:start position:0%
that had Direct Grant Aid that was
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
helping to cover some of the upfront
 
02:41:39.830 --> 02:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
costs seven states that useful direct
 
02:41:43.010 --> 02:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
granted and debt reimbursement and six
 
02:41:44.750 --> 02:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
states that only were doing it through
 
02:41:47.210 --> 02:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
debt reimbursement process so so Most
 
02:41:49.010 --> 02:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
states were kind of similar to New
 
02:41:50.750 --> 02:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as opposed to just doing the
 
02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
debt reimbursement process where
 
02:41:56.030 --> 02:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
um they're just paying off annually of
 
02:41:58.490 --> 02:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
locally issued debt and they have an
 
02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
amortization schedule that is paying off
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
those okay okay no no that's good and I
 
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I was clear on the
 
02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
question too that that um that when I
 
02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
talk about a pro I'm not talking about
 
02:42:12.050 --> 02:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
necessarily upfront costs or soft costs
 
02:42:14.929 --> 02:42:14.939 align:start position:0%
associated with the project uh
 
02:42:17.510 --> 02:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
um really talking about that the that
 
02:42:20.510 --> 02:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
the you know if if um if if a project
 
02:42:23.570 --> 02:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
has been approved for 10 million dollars
 
02:42:25.969 --> 02:42:25.979 align:start position:0%
in in state
 
02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
um building a grant that that
 
02:42:31.849 --> 02:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
essentially that 10 million dollars gets
 
02:42:31.859 --> 02:42:33.290 align:start position:0%
essentially that 10 million dollars gets
paid

02:42:33.290 --> 02:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
paid
 
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
um I forgot what it is in New Hampshire
 
02:42:41.650 --> 02:42:41.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you know 10 months later but it's
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
essentially all up you know it's up
 
02:42:49.670 --> 02:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
front as opposed to
 
02:42:52.130 --> 02:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
um uh trickling out in 20 payments as
 
02:42:54.349 --> 02:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
you say to help the districts help the
 
02:42:55.790 --> 02:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
district cover
 
02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:04.370 --> 02:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
yeah the 80 might be a bit High I I was
 
02:43:07.969 --> 02:43:07.979 align:start position:0%
answering those 25 states are are not
 
02:43:11.690 --> 02:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
paying over the full length of the loan
 
02:43:14.030 --> 02:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
um they are paying in a series of
 
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
installments it could be primarily up
 
02:43:18.170 --> 02:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
front like you're saying New Hampshire
 
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
or you know five to
 
02:43:24.530 --> 02:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
ten payments over a few years but it's
 
02:43:24.540 --> 02:43:25.490 align:start position:0%
ten payments over a few years but it's
not

02:43:25.490 --> 02:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
um it's not done
 
02:43:31.010 --> 02:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
um throughout the life cycle of the
 
02:43:32.809 --> 02:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
entire loan that's the deputy
 
02:43:35.270 --> 02:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement model OKAY fewer states
 
02:43:36.710 --> 02:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
are doing all right so so it doesn't
 
02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
have to be synchronous with the with the
 
02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
term of the of the bond
 
02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
um uh but but could be done
 
02:43:49.790 --> 02:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
in an accelerated uh uh yeah as the
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
costs are being spent by the district
 
02:43:54.469 --> 02:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
right okay great thanks thanks Chris
 
02:43:56.990 --> 02:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
what about going further with this now
 
02:43:59.270 --> 02:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
so we
 
02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
what about
 
02:44:04.429 --> 02:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
paying less up front you know uh to the
 
02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
school district so we have more money to
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
incorporate more more projects more
 
02:44:10.319 --> 02:44:12.590 align:start position:0%
incorporate more more projects more
projects

02:44:12.590 --> 02:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
projects
 
02:44:14.830 --> 02:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
um that's another Avenue we could take
 
02:44:18.110 --> 02:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
and I like what what Chris has suggested
 
02:44:19.870 --> 02:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
too it doesn't necessarily have to be
 
02:44:22.670 --> 02:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
synchronized with the um with the with
 
02:44:25.610 --> 02:44:25.620 align:start position:0%
the the term of the bond but maybe over
 
02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
maybe the if it's a 10 million dollar
 
02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:28.670 align:start position:0%
maybe the if it's a 10 million dollar
project

02:44:28.670 --> 02:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:44:31.250 --> 02:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
or sorry a 10 million dollar grant that
 
02:44:33.170 --> 02:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
that's paid out 2 million a year over
 
02:44:36.770 --> 02:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
five years and so um so you know that
 
02:44:38.270 --> 02:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
would give the district some flexibility
 
02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of how they want to go
 
02:44:42.770 --> 02:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
um you know the terms of paying off the
 
02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
bonds well and allow us to do more more
 
02:44:47.809 --> 02:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
projects too yeah I got one other
 
02:44:49.429 --> 02:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
question here for you
 
02:44:53.929 --> 02:44:53.939 align:start position:0%
um we do utilize uh to support those
 
02:44:56.090 --> 02:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
communities which may have less of an
 
02:44:59.510 --> 02:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
economic ability High property taxes etc
 
02:45:03.349 --> 02:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
etc uh we we use medium family income
 
02:45:03.359 --> 02:45:06.010 align:start position:0%
etc uh we we use medium family income
slash

02:45:06.010 --> 02:45:06.020 align:start position:0%
slash
 
02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
property value our valuation of property
 
02:45:09.120 --> 02:45:10.910 align:start position:0%
property value our valuation of property
so

02:45:10.910 --> 02:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:14.690 --> 02:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
with that we have some districts get 30
 
02:45:18.830 --> 02:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
percent of the of the construction costs
 
02:45:22.790 --> 02:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
Others May get 60 percent
 
02:45:26.270 --> 02:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
um we find even with some that are our
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
communities which don't really have the
 
02:45:32.750 --> 02:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
economics strength the 60 is even a
 
02:45:34.969 --> 02:45:34.979 align:start position:0%
tough because then that the locals have
 
02:45:36.650 --> 02:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
to come up with that 40 percent and
 
02:45:38.510 --> 02:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
these costs today a building suit for
 
02:45:40.130 --> 02:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
talking 30 million dollars for the
 
02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:41.270 align:start position:0%
talking 30 million dollars for the
building

02:45:41.270 --> 02:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
building
 
02:45:43.070 --> 02:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
you don't see it happening or it doesn't
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
the bond doesn't get approved on uh at
 
02:45:49.750 --> 02:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
the local level do you have some
 
02:45:52.490 --> 02:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
knowledge of states that may go above
 
02:45:55.490 --> 02:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
this 60 percent that we do and maybe
 
02:45:59.270 --> 02:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
going from 30 to 80 percent or 20 to 80
 
02:46:01.849 --> 02:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
percent widening that out a little bit
 
02:46:05.510 --> 02:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can help the the poorer towns
 
02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:06.469 align:start position:0%
so that we can help the the poorer towns
yeah

02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:46:08.570 --> 02:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
Connecticut is I'm sorry thank you
 
02:46:10.490 --> 02:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
chairman Connecticut's 20 to 80 percent
 
02:46:12.290 --> 02:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
of project costs
 
02:46:13.849 --> 02:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
um there are I'm gonna see if there's
 
02:46:16.510 --> 02:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
other examples of it going above 70
 
02:46:19.730 --> 02:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
there's typically a range uh with a
 
02:46:25.490 --> 02:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
you said kinetic was 20 to 80. 20 to 80
 
02:46:34.730 --> 02:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:34.740 --> 02:46:41.050 align:start position:0%
 
huh

02:46:41.050 --> 02:46:41.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
that that that's
 
02:46:46.670 --> 02:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
Rick that's interesting too because that
 
02:46:48.889 --> 02:46:48.899 align:start position:0%
you know 2080 obviously you know a
 
02:46:52.010 --> 02:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
factor of of four there in terms of in
 
02:46:55.790 --> 02:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
terms of a grant um uh Grant Factor but
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's very consistent with with
 
02:47:02.570 --> 02:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
um equalized valuation ranges too and
 
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
which is which is fiscal capacity yeah
 
02:47:07.730 --> 02:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
that that's exactly right very
 
02:47:09.770 --> 02:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
interesting it's it's something that
 
02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to look at yeah
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
we've mentioned that before haven't you
 
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:20.450 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:47:20.450 --> 02:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
Amy that that that
 
02:47:25.309 --> 02:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
rings a bell
 
02:47:29.270 --> 02:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
it does and it's not um not that we're
 
02:47:32.570 --> 02:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
striving for a hundred percent but Maine
 
02:47:35.150 --> 02:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
does provide close to 100 of all of
 
02:47:36.710 --> 02:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
their construction projects just trying
 
02:47:39.170 --> 02:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
to give you know context of whether it's
 
02:47:42.530 --> 02:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
reasonable to go up to 80 percent
 
02:47:44.450 --> 02:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
no that's great
 
02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:48.050 align:start position:0%
no that's great
hmm

02:47:48.050 --> 02:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:51.190 --> 02:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
are there any other you know questions
 
02:47:54.770 --> 02:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
of Chris right now
 
02:47:56.450 --> 02:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
Chris is this
 
02:47:59.090 --> 02:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
Jen do we have the a copy of the the
 
02:48:02.929 --> 02:48:02.939 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint that was just showed us or or
 
02:48:02.939 --> 02:48:04.670 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint that was just showed us or or
okay

02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:48:04.680 --> 02:48:05.929 align:start position:0%
okay
wonderful

02:48:05.929 --> 02:48:05.939 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
02:48:05.939 --> 02:48:09.770 align:start position:0%
wonderful
okay

02:48:09.770 --> 02:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:11.990 --> 02:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
well you know Chris I don't think we
 
02:48:13.429 --> 02:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
have any other questions here at this
 
02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
time but uh we'll we'll stay in touch uh
 
02:48:19.670 --> 02:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
we would like to look at some of this
 
02:48:22.490 --> 02:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
information we definitely are in a a
 
02:48:25.130 --> 02:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
process where we've been
 
02:48:27.530 --> 02:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
allocating funds out based upon a
 
02:48:29.570 --> 02:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
formula it's been around for a long long
 
02:48:29.580 --> 02:48:30.710 align:start position:0%
formula it's been around for a long long
time

02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
and there's debt out there too of which
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
if we appropriate in a given year at
 
02:48:40.010 --> 02:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
currently 50 million dollars half that's
 
02:48:41.809 --> 02:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
going to go pay off debt that we're
 
02:48:44.270 --> 02:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
obligated to pay off so it doesn't leave
 
02:48:48.110 --> 02:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
a whole lot but in the same time we're
 
02:48:51.590 --> 02:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
trying to put in place a formula that's
 
02:48:53.690 --> 02:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
going to allow us to
 
02:48:56.510 --> 02:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
sort of get away from this this process
 
02:48:58.790 --> 02:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
which we have and again more
 
02:49:00.889 --> 02:49:00.899 align:start position:0%
predictability and sustainability to the
 
02:49:00.899 --> 02:49:02.090 align:start position:0%
predictability and sustainability to the
formula

02:49:02.090 --> 02:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
formula
 
02:49:02.100 --> 02:49:04.130 align:start position:0%
formula
so

02:49:04.130 --> 02:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:07.309 --> 02:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's I guess where we are and uh it's
 
02:49:09.230 --> 02:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
a challenge
 
02:49:11.210 --> 02:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
the challenge is trying to transition
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
from where we've been to where we got to
 
02:49:14.990 --> 02:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
go because the dollars are going to have
 
02:49:19.790 --> 02:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:22.429 --> 02:49:22.439 align:start position:0%
and we've got a pretty deep backlog
 
02:49:25.250 --> 02:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
very much so
 
02:49:25.260 --> 02:49:26.690 align:start position:0%
very much so
yeah

02:49:26.690 --> 02:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
yeah we got a lot of old buildings out
 
02:49:29.570 --> 02:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
there and buildings that need
 
02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:32.809 align:start position:0%
there and buildings that need
replacement

02:49:32.809 --> 02:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:34.849 --> 02:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
so with that thank you so much for
 
02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
having us yeah well Joel we really
 
02:49:40.849 --> 02:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and of course uh we have
 
02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
Gen 4 here that works with you quite
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
often and uh so if we have some
 
02:49:47.210 --> 02:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
questions we'll work through Jen to give
 
02:49:48.530 --> 02:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
you some
 
02:49:51.710 --> 02:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
you know any Communications we may have
 
02:49:53.809 --> 02:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you so much and let's
 
02:49:55.309 --> 02:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
all go through the legislative session
 
02:49:57.950 --> 02:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
we're always here so uh please keep us
 
02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
in mind good to see you Joel thank you
 
02:50:01.730 --> 02:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
good thanks a lot have a good day yeah
 
02:50:03.010 --> 02:50:03.020 align:start position:0%
have a good one
 
02:50:06.889 --> 02:50:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:06.899 --> 02:50:08.210 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:50:08.210 --> 02:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:08.220 --> 02:50:08.929 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:50:08.929 --> 02:50:08.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:12.349 --> 02:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
we've gone through quite a bit today
 
02:50:14.450 --> 02:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
um we're at the end of this one
 
02:50:14.460 --> 02:50:15.410 align:start position:0%
um we're at the end of this one
um

02:50:15.410 --> 02:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:17.870 --> 02:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
but uh I think we also have to find out
 
02:50:20.630 --> 02:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
about the dissolution myth process for
 
02:50:22.070 --> 02:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
the charter schools so we're going to
 
02:50:23.870 --> 02:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
get a hold of Senator Lang he's not
 
02:50:25.490 --> 02:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
sharing that committee
 
02:50:27.469 --> 02:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
and interesting
 
02:50:29.750 --> 02:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah that's all we did was organize
 
02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
so but we got to go from there I think
 
02:50:35.030 --> 02:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
we have two meetings set up what were
 
02:50:36.710 --> 02:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
the two dates of that I I didn't write
 
02:50:41.210 --> 02:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:43.550 --> 02:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
September October
 
02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:46.070 align:start position:0%
September October
October

02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
October
 
02:50:47.710 --> 02:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:50:51.309 --> 02:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
September but was September
 
02:50:53.870 --> 02:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
October 4th I definitely have yeah
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
October 4th I thought it was September
 
02:50:58.910 --> 02:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
29th also but I don't see it on the
 
02:51:02.030 --> 02:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
calendar I might not happening
 
02:51:03.830 --> 02:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I did neither I'll have to contact
 
02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:07.920 --> 02:51:09.650 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:51:09.650 --> 02:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:51:11.090 --> 02:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
I guess there's a lot of information
 
02:51:11.100 --> 02:51:12.770 align:start position:0%
I guess there's a lot of information
here

02:51:12.770 --> 02:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:51:15.530 --> 02:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
um as you know the I like everybody try
 
02:51:18.590 --> 02:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
to look at that uh spreadsheet that was
 
02:51:21.950 --> 02:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
given out uh and see because that has
 
02:51:24.050 --> 02:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
some pluses of course has some minuses
 
02:51:29.030 --> 02:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
as well and as we've spoken to but uh in
 
02:51:31.370 --> 02:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
in the how to apply something like that
 
02:51:33.170 --> 02:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
even to the charter schools because
 
02:51:36.950 --> 02:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're we're working off of admr they
 
02:51:39.950 --> 02:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
would have to work off ADM a
 
02:51:42.830 --> 02:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
and and we have a five-year average
 
02:51:45.469 --> 02:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
probably be a one-year average for the
 
02:51:48.469 --> 02:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
those which are owned
 
02:51:48.479 --> 02:51:49.730 align:start position:0%
those which are owned
yes

02:51:49.730 --> 02:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:50.809 align:start position:0%
yes
so

02:51:50.809 --> 02:51:50.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:51:54.010 --> 02:51:54.020 align:start position:0%
in listening I've heard that maybe our
 
02:51:59.330 --> 02:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
114 square feet and our price is low is
 
02:52:02.330 --> 02:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
it worth reworking this with higher
 
02:52:05.389 --> 02:52:05.399 align:start position:0%
numbers I I yeah you can't you can you
 
02:52:08.150 --> 02:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
can take that that spreadsheet we have
 
02:52:10.309 --> 02:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's an Excel spreadsheet so it's one
 
02:52:13.370 --> 02:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
you can put plug-in you know cost per
 
02:52:15.410 --> 02:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
square foot you can put square foot
 
02:52:18.290 --> 02:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
that's required for grade levels in
 
02:52:19.969 --> 02:52:19.979 align:start position:0%
um you can change it or from a life
 
02:52:22.610 --> 02:52:22.620 align:start position:0%
cycle 40 years to 30 years by changing
 
02:52:25.130 --> 02:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
the life cycle from 40 to 30 years you
 
02:52:26.750 --> 02:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
have to buy another 10 million dollars
 
02:52:28.730 --> 02:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
with all the other constants remaining
 
02:52:28.740 --> 02:52:29.990 align:start position:0%
with all the other constants remaining
constant

02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
constant
 
02:52:32.690 --> 02:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
but you could change the factors for you
 
02:52:33.950 --> 02:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
know how much we're going to put in
 
02:52:35.809 --> 02:52:35.819 align:start position:0%
there for equipment or architectural
 
02:52:38.809 --> 02:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
fees or our debt retirement that can all
 
02:52:38.819 --> 02:52:40.309 align:start position:0%
fees or our debt retirement that can all
change

02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
um I guess my point is those are
 
02:52:45.170 --> 02:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
variables yeah these are two things that
 
02:52:48.170 --> 02:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
I've heard today we we may just have
 
02:52:50.809 --> 02:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
started at a little too low a point to
 
02:52:54.050 --> 02:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
look at a good comparison
 
02:52:56.330 --> 02:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I did the reason why I
 
02:52:59.090 --> 02:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
selected those figures is I took and and
 
02:53:01.250 --> 02:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
did a uh
 
02:53:03.769 --> 02:53:03.779 align:start position:0%
what was being done in that one state of
 
02:53:03.779 --> 02:53:04.849 align:start position:0%
what was being done in that one state of
Tennessee

02:53:04.849 --> 02:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
Tennessee
 
02:53:07.809 --> 02:53:07.819 align:start position:0%
then I took a a a a
 
02:53:10.030 --> 02:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
calculate calculator
 
02:53:12.830 --> 02:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
with inflation costs or what a dollar
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
was back then what it would be worth now
 
02:53:17.450 --> 02:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
it doesn't do what Amy would look at
 
02:53:19.849 --> 02:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
actual construction costs a while if
 
02:53:22.130 --> 02:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
they were initially but
 
02:53:24.710 --> 02:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
um that that can all change but we got
 
02:53:26.690 --> 02:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
to also calculate in here you're going
 
02:53:28.250 --> 02:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
to have to pay for you're gonna have to
 
02:53:29.870 --> 02:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
have that flat amount coming into the
 
02:53:32.570 --> 02:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
districts annually you're gonna have to
 
02:53:36.290 --> 02:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
pay off our debt as well
 
02:53:38.929 --> 02:53:38.939 align:start position:0%
and then you're going to have to have
 
02:53:41.570 --> 02:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
money that's available that's going to
 
02:53:44.210 --> 02:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
be taking care of these projects that
 
02:53:46.490 --> 02:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
come up that are emergencies that you're
 
02:53:49.130 --> 02:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
not aware of
 
02:53:52.010 --> 02:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
and we could be talking about initially
 
02:53:54.950 --> 02:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
there we appropriate supposedly 50
 
02:53:56.990 --> 02:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year it's going to
 
02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:58.610 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year it's going to
jump

02:53:58.610 --> 02:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
jump
 
02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
almost twice that or or you know a
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
significant hunk to pay off our debt and
 
02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
also get that money flowing in to uh put
 
02:54:12.050 --> 02:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
the money in the the the flat amount
 
02:54:14.210 --> 02:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
which they would receive and that would
 
02:54:16.130 --> 02:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
change too annually based upon
 
02:54:19.130 --> 02:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
demographics based upon costs of
 
02:54:19.140 --> 02:54:21.170 align:start position:0%
demographics based upon costs of
construction

02:54:21.170 --> 02:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
construction
 
02:54:21.180 --> 02:54:22.130 align:start position:0%
construction
um

02:54:22.130 --> 02:54:22.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:24.410 --> 02:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
and like Amy said we might want to use
 
02:54:26.690 --> 02:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
not just some of this money not just for
 
02:54:29.769 --> 02:54:29.779 align:start position:0%
me uh construction
 
02:54:29.779 --> 02:54:31.330 align:start position:0%
me uh construction
and

02:54:31.330 --> 02:54:31.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:35.690 --> 02:54:35.700 align:start position:0%
a renovation but also paying off debt
 
02:54:38.929 --> 02:54:38.939 align:start position:0%
that the district currently owns
 
02:54:42.530 --> 02:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
which is not a bad idea as well so a lot
 
02:54:44.090 --> 02:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
to it
 
02:54:45.710 --> 02:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to take us time to do it but
 
02:54:49.190 --> 02:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:52.490 --> 02:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
but I just add two chairman that I would
 
02:54:54.830 --> 02:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
encourage you to use
 
02:54:58.370 --> 02:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
um accurate representative numbers and
 
02:55:00.710 --> 02:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
then if you need to make the dollar come
 
02:55:02.809 --> 02:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
out to something that's reasonable then
 
02:55:04.790 --> 02:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
you work with the percentages so that
 
02:55:06.950 --> 02:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
the community can effectively
 
02:55:09.769 --> 02:55:09.779 align:start position:0%
communicate that the state is not indeed
 
02:55:11.870 --> 02:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
paying 60 percent they're indeed paying
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
32 percent or something because it
 
02:55:15.830 --> 02:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
allows for better Communications because
 
02:55:18.230 --> 02:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
if those numbers are not reasonable then
 
02:55:19.849 --> 02:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
it really sets the school district up
 
02:55:21.710 --> 02:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
for not really being able to communicate
 
02:55:25.130 --> 02:55:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:27.950 --> 02:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
okay I can share with everybody where I
 
02:55:29.450 --> 02:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
got some of those figures initially they
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
came from this sheet which I got from
 
02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:32.389 align:start position:0%
came from this sheet which I got from
Tennessee

02:55:32.389 --> 02:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
Tennessee
 
02:55:32.399 --> 02:55:33.170 align:start position:0%
Tennessee
um

02:55:33.170 --> 02:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:35.990 --> 02:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
but be aware that we do have another
 
02:55:37.790 --> 02:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
bill coming at us from the Senate which
 
02:55:40.370 --> 02:55:40.380 align:start position:0%
is going to be looking at this similar
 
02:55:45.830 --> 02:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:49.309 --> 02:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
okay I guess we're right at noon time
 
02:55:52.490 --> 02:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
so anything else
 
02:55:54.650 --> 02:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
okay we're adjourned
 
02:56:02.030 --> 02:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:03.950 --> 02:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
I knew you'd asked see it's not in the
 
02:56:05.450 --> 02:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
calendar because they had to reschedule
 
02:56:08.809 --> 02:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
it from what was last Friday Thursday it
 
02:56:11.450 --> 02:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
would have been last Thursday's meeting
 
02:56:15.730 --> 02:56:15.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:18.710 --> 02:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that's right it's adma it's
