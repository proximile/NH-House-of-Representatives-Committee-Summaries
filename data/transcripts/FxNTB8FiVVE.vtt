00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
approved all right so now we're going to
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
start the process of what we're going to
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
put in our final report we uh we still
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
have one piece that we're going to be
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
hearing from probably next meeting on
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
the uh problem gaming um issue but uh
 
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:50.759 align:start position:0%
given I'm the the person's going to have
 
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
to write the report I need I need input
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
from everybody on what issues uh we want
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
to um for number one there a couple
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
things we're going to say that we
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
discussed and that whether or not we
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
come to agreement on on a resolution or
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
not is something that will as we go
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
along either we're going to all agree on
 
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
something or not agree on something
 
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
that's fine it'll be in the report we
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
didn't agree we talked about it or that
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
we it needs further consideration uh
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
would be probably a third category so
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's where I want to go but
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
what I want to started with is on the 40
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
page 42 of the report I'm going to
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
emphasize this where we came from and
 
00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
it's still in our statutes and I said
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
this last meeting on page
 
00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:37.959 align:start position:0%
42 the of the uh Spectrum
 
00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
report they they talked about the RSA a
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
gaming a game operator employer is
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
defined as a business entity or
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
individual who employs
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
supervises and controls game operators
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
and who was hired by a charity
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
organization to operate games of chance
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
on its behalf on its behalf we've come a
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
long way since then and what that meant
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
was that those facilities these
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
facilities would open up when there was
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
a charity who wanted to have a casino
 
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
night at their location and it's evolved
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
now to where we have two large casinos
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
about to be built one in ashaa and now
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
it looks like the Salam one it sounds
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
like I read in the union leader so it
 
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's pretty much there the
 
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
um the uh um Joe faroh uh place in in uh
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
Salem and these These are quite large as
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
well uh both of those are pretty large
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
so uh still not full for casinos that
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
you would find in other states but but
 
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
large by our
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
standards so um so thus here we are as a
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
commission uh have to address a bunch of
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
issues so we're going to start with I
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
have two documents that you was you were
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
were sent and one was the was our
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
um was the Statute that created the
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
commission and there's five points that
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
we were supposed to cover and then I
 
00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
have my other list because um I think
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
the Spectrum report brought up some
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
issues that we we be nice if we could
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
take opinion on I'm planning another
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
three meetings this meeting and then
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
three more then we run out of time the
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
last meeting we're going to have to
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
approve the report so between now and
 
00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:24.829 align:start position:0%
approve the report so between now and
mid-

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
mid-
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
October uh I'll be drafting a report uh
 
00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:29.350 align:start position:0%
October uh I'll be drafting a report uh
that

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
obviously send that ahead of time in
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
that last meeting we're going to have to
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
agree on that report and we can make
 
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
modifications on it and I'll agree that
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
we would send a if we meet on Mondays we
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
have until the end of that week to to
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
get the report in so if you go to the
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
the original charges I'm going to do the
 
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do the two easy ones
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
first um this the Third charge was
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
whether charging rented Charities is
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
necessary with historic
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
racing and I think the legislator has
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
already figured that one out so I'm I'm
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
going to ask for a vote that we are in
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
agreement with what the legislature has
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
done and doing away with rent as is is
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
any discussion on that before we we talk
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
about it no so um so I would say
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
something in the report that the uh the
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
legislature um and both bodies s signed
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
to law um was agreed to do away with the
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
rent and I'll probably put some other
 
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799 align:start position:0%
text in there to as to why uh but um so
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
can we take a vote on that as members
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
please um so all in favor of of agreeing
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
with what the legislature had
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
done can I all opposed none okay so
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's one that we agree
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
on chair that's the removal of rents
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
removal of rents and that charge is now
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
disposed of that charge is disposed of
 
00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
exactly that's what I was trying to do
 
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:02.919 align:start position:0%
that's disposed of we're agreeing with
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
what the legislature had done they took
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
action before this commission finished
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
its work so and we agreed with the
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
action of the legislature so uh number
 
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
four uh which is kind of halfway down
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
the commission also shall monitor the
 
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
benefits of historic horse racing to
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
Charities to ascertain whether
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
additional licenses for historic ra
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
horse racing machines would increase or
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
reduce Revenue to Charities I think the
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
question is did it increase or reduce
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
revenues clearly it increased revenues
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
does anybody think that revenues weren't
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
increased I think we went through this
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen the steady growth in the
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
revenues and obviously it's tributable
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
to the historic racing machines I mean
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
if that's the question um um I'm I'm
 
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
look at you Tim was that was that the
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
intent of that question in the legisl in
 
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
the legislation is
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
again when we pass this bill the idea
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
was looking at what the gross revenues
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
were looking like whether Charities due
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
to the change in the split between games
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
of chance and now HHR did that result in
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
more or less money to Charities and I
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
think the overwhelming answer is more
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
money to char more Char right so um so
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
the what what what will appear in the
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
report is that and I could probably give
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
some hard numbers in there too um
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
because I we've been looking at this for
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
a while that the the that the uh
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
revenues have increased substantially
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
since historic racing machines obviously
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
obviously any
 
00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:38.919 align:start position:0%
growth in and we're having a lot of
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
growth now um the Charities there's
 
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot more money in the pot
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
for Charities uh uh going forward so uh
 
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
yes guess I took this um question
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
here which is
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
it starts out one way and it ends
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
another is yeah and and the ascertain is
 
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:05.559 align:start position:0%
is whether additional licenses for
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
historical horse racing machines would
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
increase or reduce revenues to Charities
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
well I think that's I've been thinking
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
that that was uh a question of
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
whether whatever it is 18
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
licenses are enough or there should
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
there be more right and I not sure that
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm hearing you
 
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
say well that's because it depends on
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
how you read this read this
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
charge because then at the end this
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
increase I I have that on my other list
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
do we do we think
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
that do we could talk about it here as
 
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
well uh do we think that the 19
 
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.549 align:start position:0%
well uh do we think that the 19
licenses

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
is not enough too little what and it's
 
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.669 align:start position:0%
is not enough too little what and it's
not

00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
only again it's the licenses for the
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
number of of char of historic r ing
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
locations and this is the intent here
 
00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:03.799 align:start position:0%
but and as well we should talk about
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
number of locations
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
period um as chair I'm I you know it
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
it's not just the number of facilities
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's really also I want to talk about
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
later it's really the number of of uh uh
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
themselves you know they're saying that
 
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
we can we we have in the report and I
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
have it later on we talk about it that
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
we we're just scratching the surface of
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
be we can put a lot more of these
 
00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:41.799 align:start position:0%
machines in and
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
still uh there's the market for it is
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
what what they said in the Spectrum
 
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
report so yeah I'm one for saying well
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
let's break again so again I think we we
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
addressed this in the legislature by put
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
the moratorium on for S years so then
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
the understanding being we would then
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
reevaluate and see where we are and
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
what's going on are we hitting the 6,000
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
machines that the Spectrum says what
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
should be the next action that the
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
legislature takes so you know again I
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
think the the revenue side we dealt with
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
um yes there's an increase to revenue to
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
Charities due to HHR but then the second
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
question was should we allow more
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
licenses we've allowed for uh amount of
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
expansion to occur over the next few
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
years uh with the five applic that are
 
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
pending um but we also said we want to
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
pause there for that seven years after
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
that and then we can reevaluate um we
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
don't know what the industry is going to
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
look like in seven years what
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
consolidation might look like who's
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
going to be still alive in seven years
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of which op operations are in
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
in operation so I I think we dealt with
 
00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:51.559 align:start position:0%
that by putting the pause in and giving
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
SE a seven-year window um to freeze this
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
until we can look at it again um with
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
new data with more more um operations
 
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
possibly open doing HHR um but for us to
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
try to figure out what 19 19 operations
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
are going to look like when we only have
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
10 of the 19 I think operational with
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
HHR um we don't have a full set of data
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
so the so we could say that the that in
 
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
the report we can say that we agree with
 
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.830 align:start position:0%
the report we can say that we agree with
the

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:24.669 --> 00:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
legislature uh I just want to make sure
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
that the commission is agreeing that 19
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
was the right number
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
um it was the existing 14 plus this
 
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.310 align:start position:0%
um it was the existing 14 plus this
potential

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
five uh and I personally don't have a
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
problem with the
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
19 um I just want to hear from anybody
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
is that disagrees with the 19 and we
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
understand that it's a seven seven-year
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
moratorium above above 19 although the
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
legisl can change that any any time they
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
want uh but uh but again we have to
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that that we we felt that I
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
think we'd like to say as a commission
 
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
that we felt it needed to be a pause as
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
well uh to to see what we have here um
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
and and you know the law says it's it's
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
19 so we'll go with the 19 uh but you
 
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.039 align:start position:0%
know going forward yeah I guess we have
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
to have some time to to evaluate uh what
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
the Market's going to look like in seven
 
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
years from now B yeah I I think it's as
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
simple as the rent issue it's dealt with
 
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.870 align:start position:0%
simple as the rent issue it's dealt with
in

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
legislation all right pretty simple our
 
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799 align:start position:0%
opinions on anything don't matter for as
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
commission members us want anybody to
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
weigh in that they they agree with what
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature has done or not done so
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
Pat I would say after five years you
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
probably should put a a note in there
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
saying there should be another
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
permission established to see what the
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
mature uh Market looks like and whether
 
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
any future changes are
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
needed right yes go ahead T dick
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you um I agree with that
 
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
and I I think that um that it it
 
00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
is good to put into this report that
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's not just because the legisl passed
 
00:26:15.549 --> 00:26:15.559 align:start position:0%
this moratorium this seven years St say
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
we think it makes sense in the
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances and it also means that
 
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
five years from now or whatever um that
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
the uh legislature needs to consider
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
the next step
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
right okay so we agree and that that it
 
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be examined in the future once
 
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
again we'll say five years um and and
 
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
we'll go from there uh yes John yeah I
 
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
mean I would agree with that as well
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't have all the data we
 
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
only have 10 now I mean it's there's no
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
way we're going to see into the future
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
and know that so the 5 years to
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
reevaluate mix perfect
 
00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:02.919 align:start position:0%
sense I I I think it does make sense in
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
this context right now we know that
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
under under construction are two Mammoth
 
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
facilities they're not even an operation
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
as we speak we have a third one the
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
Conway situation which is under the
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
construction so it's not operational as
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
we speak we have the sandborn situation
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
which has not been settled that's
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
hanging out over us is there another
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
license available you know is there a
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
license available for
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
conquer and who's going to make the
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's involved in that the
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission is involved all of
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
these things are hanging out there you
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
know as as as we speak so this this
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
momentum for for growth is is is there
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
this situation with regard to cker it it
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
is there those things have to be have to
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
be resolved
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh as as we move forward they got to be
 
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.149 align:start position:0%
uh as as we move forward they got to be
in

00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
place you're all said if youed you're
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
going to look at how things are going
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
and I think we have we as a commission
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
have to have to Define what is a
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
casino what is a casino is it a
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
charitable gabing facility that could be
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
called a casino because of the way it it
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
operates I mean it it there's got to be
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
something in law that governs what we're
 
00:28:32.909 --> 00:28:32.919 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at and and what we're
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
evaluating as we as we move forward
 
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
again we're we're still we're still
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
working on the that's the reason I read
 
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.470 align:start position:0%
working on the that's the reason I read
page

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
42 of the of the report that language is
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
still in there it's that language is
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
that the Charities are in the driver's
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
seat that was always the Charities are
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
always in the driver's seat that's not
 
00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
the case anymore they're not in the
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
driver's seat I don't think well I I I
 
00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent I disagree again
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have a charity to operate
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
they don't operate right so the charity
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
charity is still in charge of you know
 
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
they they they the Charities control
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
what whether they open their doors or
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
not which I would say puts them in the
 
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
driver's seat um if there's not a
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
charity available um
 
00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
so we have the reverse problem the
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
word's out everybody wants in yeah so so
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
again I think they're still in the
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
driver's seat the question is uh around
 
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
the revenue stuff we talked about
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
earlier but um the other thing I want to
 
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair the number two item which is
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
whether the state should limit the
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
number I was going to get there I just
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
want to finish one of I said know was
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
the second half of the HHR question
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
right we kind of limited nobody's going
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
to open a a games of chance location at
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
least not a s a big one um without HHR
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
and since we have a moratorium on HR
 
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
we've already put a a default DEA facto
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
limit on the number of charitable gaming
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
operations you might see I mean Chasers
 
00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:54.519 align:start position:0%
which is the outlier I think right
 
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
Chasers was a poker room and yet it made
 
00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of money um just
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
doing poker and you might see something
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
like that open up but again it's not the
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
HHR proliferation that we're talking
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
about so you know I think we've already
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
dealt with number two as well with the
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
moratorium um and I don't know that we
 
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
have let's come back to that as a motion
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
at the end after we do this one let's
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
finish uh so what we're saying is that
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
we agree with well one clarifying
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
thought so basically we're talking about
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
the the HHR license is and like we said
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
not every facility has one and or wants
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
one most that are in the business are
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
eventually going to get there but some
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
of the smaller ones you're realizing
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
there's a certain risk involved in that
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
and they may or may not go in that
 
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.630 align:start position:0%
and they may or may not go in that
direction

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
um but I'm I lost my thought now so but
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
anyway we we we I guess the motion is
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
going to be that we um we agree with
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
what the legislature has done in this in
 
00:30:57.679 --> 00:30:58.870 align:start position:0%
what the legislature has done in this in
this

00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
moratorium uh and that it should be
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
evaluated out in the future perhaps 5
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
years I'll say uh as to you know again
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
to see what the environment looks like
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
in the future so are we all agreeing to
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
that is there any other comment
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
that NOP okay so all in favor of
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
something like that we'll probably go
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
through these again when I have the
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
final report you're going to see actual
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
words and you can you you can
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
agree prelim just preliminary for me to
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
move forward writing something so is
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
everybody all in favor of that say I I
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
I'll oppose no okay obain obain okay I'm
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
sorry I will do obain now sorry it's
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
just policy questions like that sort
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
right so um so then let's go back up to
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
the second bullet there whether the
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
state should Implement a limit on the
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
number of uh uh number of travel gaming
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
ations and and and um and Tim's Tim's
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
point was probably well taken you know
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
if they're gonna if someone new is going
 
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
to come in they're going to want what's
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
attracting everybody is historic racing
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have historic racing none
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
of these big companies would be here
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
none of them I mean uh the only one that
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
took a at least the brook took a risk
 
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:24.039 align:start position:0%
assuming that someday that we'd have
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
slot machines or something uh but uh but
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
all these big companies are in now um
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
and I I don't see anybody else moving in
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
um and the environment is changing it's
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to have big guys and small
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
guys and the big guys are going to you
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
know they'll they'll probably have more
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
attractions other reasons to to to go to
 
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.509 align:start position:0%
attractions other reasons to to to go to
these

00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess so what would the motion
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
be for this Tim Mr the second one so I
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
would put that the the actions of the
 
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
legislature in the previous term
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
limiting the number of HHR licenses have
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
de facto uh limited the number of
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
locations for the next seven years
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
um and that no no recommendation would
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
be made to make any changes yes the only
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
thing I'd say again is the one thing I
 
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
was when we talk about this the other
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
thing you got to remember is that we
 
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
started this commission I don't the data
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
we were using originally was there's
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
only seven or seven uh HHR licenses held
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
now it's up to 10 um because of people
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
coming online so
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
again all of this conversation has been
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
around HHR I don't think anybody's heard
 
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
complaints about game regular games of
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
chance type of Charity so again the
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
table game stuff um and so I I don't
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
know that we have to limit that at all
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
there's been no discussion but that's
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
the problem um so to speak so I don't
 
00:33:59.629 --> 00:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
think we should limit games of chance
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
operators the limit is on HHR which is
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
the more concerning issue around problem
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
gaming and and and expansion yeah I
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
think the language
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
was originally when it was still
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
eligible for HR so I think it's no
 
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
longer right so so give given the fact
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
that we've limited HHR we don't we
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
should not put restrictions on the
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
number of games of chance licenses
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay you all said exact same okay all
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
right so and given that the environment
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
has changed and since the the period of
 
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
time that this commission's been in in
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
place uh we feel that there should be no
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
limit on the the number of travel gaming
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
locations uh if a small one opens up in
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
some local some small local with some
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
table games uh we're okay with that is
 
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing but again G given the
 
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
fact that we've um paused HHR licensing
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
right right so that's the reason why
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
we're not re making recommendations for
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
changes in number of games a chance yeah
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
nothing negates an applicant going to
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
lottery today or wherever and filing an
 
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
application right we shouldn't limit
 
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
that right okay all right uh then with
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
that general idea uh all in favor of
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
that kind of a motion
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
I against abstain abstain okay again
 
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:22.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through these once I
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
had the final report with the actual
 
00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:29.079 align:start position:0%
words uh all right right so we did One
 
00:35:29.079 --> 00:35:31.470 align:start position:0%
words uh all right right so we did One
two

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
rent then number five the last one the
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
commission well go ahead well we have
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
number one which is split into two
 
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
pieces how Charities are selected and
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
should the process be uniform what list
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
are we going through this is off of the
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
charge of the committee oh the charge of
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
the committee charge of the committee
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we making sure we answer those
 
00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
first before we get
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
into as I blocked them out there was
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
like uh there was like five charges
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
so I I jumped to the easier ones first
 
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
and then then the first one was the
 
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
commission shall examine how Charities
 
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
are selected and whether a uniform
 
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
process should exist if if you want to
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
do the F the last one I have a
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation the revenue the host
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
Community Revenue split oh yeah let's do
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
that let's do that one first so the
 
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
commission shall examine whe whether
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
host Community shall share in proceeds
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
of any charal gaming establishment okay
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
that was in the legisl legislation as
 
00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:28.349 align:start position:0%
that was in the legisl legislation as
well

00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
uh but the way it's structured now
 
00:36:32.309 --> 00:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
they're never going to get any money
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
because there's so many Charities that
 
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
are the way the law is now is that only
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
if there's an open
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
date uh with the with the Charities uh
 
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
and there's no Open dates so go ahead no
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
again I I agree the the way the uh it
 
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
was it was set up was again the last
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
thing we wanted to do is have government
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
bump a charity um for the purpose of
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue um and so therefore again the
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
the core function of the operation is
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming um and so the uh we
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
felt Charities had first priority over
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
the government before the government got
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
it took more money so um so I
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't there there's um so we can do that
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
we can leave it the way it is and again
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
reality is that there's no real function
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
to it because there's always a wait list
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's always somebody in queue from a
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
charity to go forward so it's non it's
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional though it does doesn't
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
have any any function to actually pass
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
the law to do that um other than on the
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
off chance a charity you have a SK you
 
00:37:39.069 --> 00:37:39.079 align:start position:0%
have something on the schedule and a
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
charity drops out closes its doors
 
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
before their date comes up you could
 
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
drop a municipality in if you ran into
 
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
that situation where a charity closed up
 
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
its doors you got your three month I
 
00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
think G you said it's three months out
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
roughly is what you do for
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
Charities yes it's recently changed that
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
we can extend it out like past that I
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
believe Charlie or Val could confirm I
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
think it used to be because of
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
background checks but we can extend out
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
past that to we're all looking the valve
 
00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:11.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so the question was um how far out
 
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
can they schedule Charities as a gaming
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
op it used to be the 60 months it used
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
to be 60 days but I think because it was
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
you wanted the background checks for the
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
Charities but those got eliminated so I
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
think it's like I don't know how far out
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
and you want to make sure the charity is
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
in good standing too at the same time so
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
so by leaving it the way it is what we
 
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
have now with Charity as the first go if
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
unoff chance of Charity dropped out
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
after already being scheduled you could
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
drop the municipality in to our
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge since the law passed is any
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
municipality gotten any dates I would
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
doubt it it's too
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
new too question for charity so so if
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
there's a 60-day requirement does that
 
00:39:08.349 --> 00:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
mean if that 60-day requirement is not
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
met they can't dial in another
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
charity no we usually find a way there's
 
00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
been times when they haven't met that
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
okay I just I I don't I don't want to
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
run into a scenario where a charity
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
didn't get cleared out 60 days and and
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
we start dialing municipalities into
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm not I'm not a fan this is
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming I remember it's only
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
once every 12 months right so even if
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
one it's only one charity one time a
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
year if gets dropped off they could fill
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
a municipality in but then that
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
municipality's got its 10 days it
 
00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:04.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't get any more days they can get
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
one day they can get one day or two days
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
at a time if yeah they could do that
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's more like a recommendation too it
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
used to be you couldn't book out past 60
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
days because the background check they
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that was good at that
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
time and nothing changed and now it's
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
like they recommend at least 68 just so
 
00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
you have wiggle roam like if they're not
 
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
in good standing with charitable trust
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
because they forgot to file for the year
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
right but I don't think that process is
 
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
broken all right that there's plenty of
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
wiggle room time to to so that's that's
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
that's I'm just fores seeeing the
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
ramifications of I I wasn't a fan of
 
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation to begin with and the
 
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
ramifications of this if a municipality
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
gets dialed into days the legisl has
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
already spoken about Charities for years
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
this is charitable gaming all right
 
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
let's put this we should have the
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
Charities taken president so as a
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
commission let's forget about what the
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
law was Mr chair yes yes um
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I uh we're talking about the uh
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
certainties and uncertainties of uh
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
having an opportunity for municipalities
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
to get some money by getting days um and
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
the question is whether municipalities
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
should uh get money period yes that's in
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
my mind which is a little bit different
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
and then how do they get it is the
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
second question so right um on the first
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
question question my my concern is that
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
we seem to be headed towards some big
 
00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.710 align:start position:0%
we seem to be headed towards some big
gaming

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
establishments and uh back uh 10 years
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
ago or 12 years ago Senator dandre will
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
maybe remember um we uh with that gaming
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
commission we're looking at a very big
 
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
casino and one of the big questions was
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
um what did the town it was expected it
 
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
would be Salem but uh you know nobody
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
said that except everybody said it um
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
and uh uh what would they need to deal
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
with the public safety issues that uh
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
fell with hosting a a big casino and
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
maybe that's what we're headed for here
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a very legitimate
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
question I don't have the answer what
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
should be allocated and how it should be
 
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
allocated and maybe there's an argument
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
that property tax revenues uh from from
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
the presence of a big facility like this
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
and it's uh uh related facilities uh
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
take takes care of the question um you
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
know we should have that discussion or
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
if we're not able to do it with the
 
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
information we have we should flag it as
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
a question for future consideration by
 
00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:48.589 align:start position:0%
a question for future consideration by
the

00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
legislature good yeah I I think uh
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
represent Ames is correct the situation
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
was as it as the entities grew what what
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
was the responsibility of the
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
municipality in terms of containing it
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
yet we we discussed paring problems
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
talked about security problems all all
 
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
of these entities coming together when
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
you thought when you had a lot a very
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
large facility and who would bear the
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh for that was it the
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
entity itself or the municipality and a
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion about the municipality
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
and and the cost of inur that's going to
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
have to be looked at as as we move
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
forward when you look at the the size of
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
the shable gaming operations that we're
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
talking we're talking about as as as U
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
as I see it at this at this moment in
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
time you we are we are somebody's
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
considering basically four large
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
facilities now you're talking about
 
00:43:57.549 --> 00:43:57.559 align:start position:0%
100,000 square ft
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
you're talking about nasua Salem
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
Rochester and conquered these these
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
haven't been these haven't been
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
constructed yet and we how big is your
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
Conway the one in Conway is pretty small
 
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
under square footage under I believe
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
15,000 square feet so so what we've what
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen with these new ones is is the
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter that someone is going
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
to have to support these these entities
 
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
and if they're in a
 
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
municipality located within a a district
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
in that municipality somebody is going
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
to have to uh support the the items that
 
00:44:44.549 --> 00:44:44.559 align:start position:0%
they they're requesting and we spent a
 
00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:47.319 align:start position:0%
lot of time talking about that and we
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
did we we always talked about a
 
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
percentage going to the local
 
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
municipality in in order to sustain that
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
so uh I think as these as as these
 
00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.069 align:start position:0%
so uh I think as these as as these
things

00:44:59.069 --> 00:44:59.079 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
grow these things are going to have to
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
be considered by a few you're talking
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
about it was part of the gross Gaming
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
revenue the the the gross number small
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of the gross rate we talked
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
about that in the in those discussions
 
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
there were there were many ways of doing
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
it but that was one of the things do you
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
remember that is that I don't remember
 
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what the number was yeah maybe
 
00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
you do Charlie yeah I think it was three
 
00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
to the community that hosted and then 1%
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
shared by
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
joining that's right something like that
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
wait wait 3% of 3% of the gross revenues
 
00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
3% of yeah of the gross so it was
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
essentially be like three million a year
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
would have been Salem and then a joining
 
00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
Community shared a million yeah
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
were based on those revenues Aaron first
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
Aaron and yeah I just want to mention
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
there have been and will be
 
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities for cities to have their
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
input heard and get something out of the
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
casino you know for instance the one in
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
nashwa the Nash they had to get Planning
 
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
and Zoning um lot the one they're
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
proposing in Salem same thing they're
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
going through City hearings we've in
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
Dover we had to agree to certain things
 
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
to get zoning orces so the city want it
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
um off duty police there so all the
 
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
communities are getting for the most
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
part their say in these larger
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
developments so it's not like they don't
 
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
have any they don't get a share of the
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
revenue but they could ask for it in
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
some of these mes I think just it it the
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
nature the nature the process has grown
 
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
dramatically and and as a result of that
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
the planning operations in the in in the
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
community the zoning operations in the
 
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
community they all have to be considered
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about something
 
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
more than just the church Hall you know
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
night that there's a lot more that's now
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
com come into play
 
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
that those things are happening someone
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that they will be paying
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
property tax you know that's kind of a
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
footprint let's say 100,000 square feet
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh but I think the norm is that
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
that we should have had Spectrum this
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
the norm is that that the facilities
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
will pay a little extra for security
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's not your average business this this
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
this business is going to be open till
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
what 3:00 or 4 in the morning uh aren't
 
00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
here yet um but there's there's extra
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
police um presence I think that that
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
we're talking about really more than
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
anything else um so I I I guess the way
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
to handle it is that number one that do
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
we agree that there should be some
 
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.349 align:start position:0%
we agree that there should be some
additional

00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:51.079 align:start position:0%
payment and I guess by the facilities
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
and I I'm I'm I kind of hesitated
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
3% um we don't have to agree to the
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
exact number it this moment but uh but
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
big picture-wise is it is it should the
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
Charities we may not all agree on this
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
so should the uh
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
facilities pay uh an increment of let's
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
just say gross gaming
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
revenues 3% seems really high um but um
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
let's have that discussion real quick
 
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
Tim so so again M the nowhere in this
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
commission we was there actually any
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
data presented that says that this
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
business creates any more Public Safety
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
or other issues than any other business
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
in a community um a restaurant and a bar
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
you know that's a large sports bar
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
probably has more calls to service for
 
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement than a a than a gaming
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
facility does in this modern Market that
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
we have now so I want to be careful
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
about H creating this this idea that you
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
know the day of the CD casino and having
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
unsavory characters are a little bit
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
different than what we have now um and
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that there was no
 
00:48:59.470 --> 00:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
data anywhere in any conversation
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
whether in this commission or in my or
 
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
in my ways of Means Committee on when we
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
were talking about Revenue sharing um
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
was uh there I want to remind I think uh
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
someone brought it up that all of these
 
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
facilities have to go through site
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
planning review so you talk about
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
parking they have the same restrictions
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
as any site plan review for any other
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
business they have a number of parking
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
spaces they need there's health and
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
safety concerns that they that are
 
00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
lighting concerns you know lots of
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
things I think in the case of Rochester
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
they were actually talking about actual
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh Aesthetics of the place that was was
 
00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
of concern than being dealt with so
 
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
again I think municipalities have a huge
 
00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:39.559 align:start position:0%
amount of impact as to how that is
 
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
handled and I'll remind you know again
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
that like every other business in town
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
they pay property taxes if there's a
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
water sewer district they pay for the
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
water and sewer they use there's a fire
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
district they pay part of the fire
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
district so all of these things that are
 
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
added taxes based on the evaluation of a
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
community of of a building are paid to
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
the community me into the community
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
already to alleviate taxes and I just
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any data that says that
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
these facilities create a a a
 
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
disproportionate amount of service
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
requests that increase cost for
 
00:50:14.829 --> 00:50:14.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh so so I just want to
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
be careful that we don't go we don't you
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
know say that now that being said I'm
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
also in favor of taxpayer relief and so
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
if we can find if there are days that
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to be unused and we are
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
bumping a charity then we can give that
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
to the municipality and that would be
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
unexpected revenue from the municipality
 
00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:34.839 align:start position:0%
that they could use to help lower
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
property and give property tax relief to
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
the local communities that's the reason
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
why the bill was put forward the way it
 
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
was was we didn't want to bump Charities
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
but we did want to have the opportunity
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
to maybe have taxpayer relief if there
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
was an availability within a in a
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
facility so for me I I'm not a big I I I
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
would I don't mind it if we can do it as
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer relief not as dedicated funds
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
and and like like I said in the way we
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
structured that bill that was the idea
 
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
that it would be unexpected income to
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
the community that would result in prop
 
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer relief the the other
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
thing is
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of these especially the larger
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
ones do have Security on the inside that
 
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
they pay for your facilities oh yeah
 
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
right we we have 247 Security on our
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
property do you have camera you have
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
know inside the casino there's cameras
 
00:51:25.789 --> 00:51:25.799 align:start position:0%
everywhere how about in the parking lot
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
do you have cameras in the parking lot
 
00:51:29.309 --> 00:51:29.319 align:start position:0%
yes do but I don't know if that's a
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
requirement right I'm saying we have
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
like 24/7 security officers like on our
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
premise at all times right um another
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
thing I mean I feel like we're going a
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
little out of scope I think we should
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
leave it up to the municipalities
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
because you do have to get a license
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
from them as well and they can make
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
requirements we've even requested like a
 
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:53.559 align:start position:0%
resource officer Hut um but
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately even if we were to give
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
money I think the main concern talking
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
about is more police presence and we
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
hire police details when we can we even
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
supported leg legislation locally to
 
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
increase their pay which 100% comes out
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
of our pocket it goes to to pay the
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
detail of course and then there's a
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
little extra to pay the city there's
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
some taxes um but so it there's a
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
shortage on police officers so even if
 
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
we dump more money into it I'm not
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
confident it would equal more police
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
presence do you saying your security is
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
detailed we do we hire police details
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
when we can they don't
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
always and it's a volunteer just to that
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
point that municipalities uh are in
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
charge of that I know Salem has put put
 
00:52:47.789 --> 00:52:47.799 align:start position:0%
requirements in relation to police
 
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
details at the room that's present so I
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
mean as far as that
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
goes it sounds like the issue more and
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
more I'm hearing here is that that
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities through the their
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
licensing process for these facilities
 
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
are probably making certain requests of
 
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:07.910 align:start position:0%
are probably making certain requests of
the

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
facilities to have to have certain
 
00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.870 align:start position:0%
facilities to have to have certain
security

00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:53:15.549 --> 00:53:15.559 align:start position:0%
coverage uh paid for by the
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
facility um the question is do we really
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
need to weigh in on this now uh it
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
sounds like dick go ahead yeah my my
 
00:53:27.789 --> 00:53:27.799 align:start position:0%
feeling is um
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
is that I would not want to support I
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
would not support a a um a
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation that uh said um that came
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
out against any provision for um
 
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
allocation of revenues to host
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
communities or borderline communities
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
however you want to describe it to the
 
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
area um for a special costs that arise
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
um I would not want to support a
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
categorical uh rejection of that
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
Prospect I I can support flagging the
 
00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
issue saying it's an issue the
 
00:54:15.069 --> 00:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
commission discussed there are various
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
ways to address this including uh what
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
we what has been talked about here and
 
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
um and uh it may be a subject that
 
00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:26.839 align:start position:0%
warrants future legislation and leave it
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
at that yeah
 
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
okay I I think that might be the
 
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
solution to this to get unanimity um on
 
00:54:39.549 --> 00:54:39.559 align:start position:0%
this um okay so let's what dick just
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
said probably covers it all so no
 
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation recommend future study if
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
if legure feels its per right and I just
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
want to if I may respond uh to one thing
 
00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang said
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
um is is true we haven't discussed this
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
we we haven't heard information about
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
issues in
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
this uh uh on this matter but um that's
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
really because we didn't ask for it
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
didn't get centered uh we didn't ask
 
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
Spectrum to tell us what other places
 
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
around the country do on this and um we
 
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
didn't yes we didn't specifically ask
 
00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:21.039 align:start position:0%
them to do that and it wasn't in their
 
00:55:21.039 --> 00:55:22.230 align:start position:0%
them to do that and it wasn't in their
report

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah thank you all right uh so we'll
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
take a quick vote here all in favor of
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
of not making a specific recommendation
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
on this but that we should leave the
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
door open for the future uh that it
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
should it should be looked at in the
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
future is that okay so all I'm favor of
 
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
that say I I I'll oppos abstain okay
 
00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so that leaves us
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
with one left on this list
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
um I lost where I was here
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
we they're selected whe should be yeah
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
number one so you know I've tried to
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
bring this up all along uh We've we've
 
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
had some discussion on
 
00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.390 align:start position:0%
had some discussion on
it

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh is there a uniform process I would
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
say no we leave it up to the facilities
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
to other than that what the law says up
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
to 10 days so they can give up to 10
 
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
days they can do five five55 they can do
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
fil one or two but maximum of 10
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
days and the way they pick the Charities
 
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
because I've talked to some other owners
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
as well on this and it sounds like
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
there's different points of view on this
 
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I don't think correct me if I'm
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
wrong anywhere in the statutes that we
 
00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:46.039 align:start position:0%
actually give guidance to how to pick
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
these Charities other than other than
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
the number of days that that they can
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
and they have to pass the the charity
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
has to make we have to make sure that
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
they're a legitimate
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
charity um and is it a year is it no
 
00:56:59.549 --> 00:56:59.559 align:start position:0%
that's the wrong one it's not a year
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
waiting time they they can do it and
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
once they're approved they're
 
00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.870 align:start position:0%
once they're approved they're
approved

00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
um and again my my bigger issue is is
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
now we're up to you know the brook
 
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
everybody's getting about 150,000 plus a
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
year uh places that are large or these
 
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
we're getting to a point where what the
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
limit should be uh if there should be a
 
00:57:26.829 --> 00:57:26.839 align:start position:0%
limit uh it's it's all success I mean
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
this success has brought this
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
on um but some point you're going to say
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
that we need three Charities instead of
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
two you know when the when the Nash
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
opens and when this other place opens
 
00:57:40.029 --> 00:57:40.039 align:start position:0%
this is not this discussion isn't really
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
for the smaller places it's really for
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
the larger places
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
where the payouts you know charity is
 
00:57:47.549 --> 00:57:47.559 align:start position:0%
going to get
 
00:57:51.069 --> 00:57:51.079 align:start position:0%
300,000 uh but but but underlying all of
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
that is is there uniformity of course
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
the question is is there
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
process well not really and tell me I'm
 
00:58:02.109 --> 00:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
wrong someone tell me I'm wrong that
 
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
there isn't a uniform process let's
 
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
start there goad so again breaking it
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
down into two pieces right there's two
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
questions answered in that first
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
questions asked in that first charge the
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
first question is how they're selected
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
and they're selected by the local gaming
 
00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.039 align:start position:0%
operator um based on application right
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
whoever whoever applies right they come
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
in they put an application in sometimes
 
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh they will uh go and and Chase it op G
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh charity but um but it's basically
 
00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:33.640 align:start position:0%
it's an application process based on
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
first come first serve who shows up they
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
go fill out the application and then uh
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
they're put in the queue so I think the
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
the the first question is on on the how
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's selected is it's selected by the uh
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
local gaming operator whether or not we
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
think that's appropriate or not is the
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
first question right and the result and
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
the results of that the second question
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
is um given that it's it that process
 
00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
occurs do we want uniformity amongst all
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
gaming operators on how they select a
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
charity right is the second question um
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm completely okay with the
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
local gaming operators picking their
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
Charities um again there's C there's a
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
certain aspect of I'm not sure why we
 
00:59:19.029 --> 00:59:19.039 align:start position:0%
would require um Gate City casino to do
 
00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
the Berlin little league as a
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
requirement um there there's no
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
geographical connection it doesn't make
 
00:59:28.349 --> 00:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
sense it no input there's no way the the
 
00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:29.799 align:start position:0%
Berlin little league is going to
 
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
advertise for its members to go running
 
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
down to Nashua to participate in gaming
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
so there's not even any cross
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
promotional aspect to it so I'm okay
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
with having with having local operators
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
uh choose do I think there should be a
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
more uniform process in the second half
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
of that question I think the answer is
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
yes and I'm not sure that there's
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
legislative requirements needed to do
 
00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
that um it could be as much as a rules
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
like hey Lottery can issue the form
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
here's the charity form I don't know if
 
00:59:58.510 --> 00:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
they do that already um but here's the
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
forms that the Charity's got to fill out
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
to and and the process for making that
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
happen um so and make sure that all the
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
operators follow the same exact process
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
for doing that so I think the revenue
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
conversation is a completely different
 
01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
conversation and I want to take that
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
outside the charge of the of the um of
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the uh committee and if it's a
 
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation beyond the charges of the
 
01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
committee let's take that Revenue split
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
conversation about three Charities two
 
01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
Charities $100,000 $775,000 what's the
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
number yeah and I and so and I've
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
already said in these meetings that
 
01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:32.039 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to need more time
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
on that one um that the recommendation
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
and we'll handle this later on the
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation may be that that there be
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
another commission just to look at that
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of there's going
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
to be a lot that goes into that um
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's all about the numbers so
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
um all right so this one is
 
01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair yeah
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
one one question I would just ask the
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
committee and just popped into my head
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
is should is so right now the law limits
 
01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
up to two only two Charities Max is that
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
true yes um and do we want to
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
potentially recommend that that Max be
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
hard because I know one of the qu one of
 
01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
the concerns you had was that sometimes
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
little you felt like little league was
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
getting too much it was Way Beyond what
 
01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
you thought they
 
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
needed and then the question becomes do
 
01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:28.309 align:start position:0%
needed and then the question becomes do
operators

01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
operators
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
hesitate working with small Charities
 
01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
because now they think okay well it
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make sense for this
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
charity to get this huge amount of money
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
do we up the number of recommended let
 
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
the charity decide they can have up to
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
maybe four I'm just throwing a number
 
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
I've not thought about it maybe up to
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
four or five so that they're less likely
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
to say well I don't want to just have
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
one or two small Charities but maybe
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
there's a group of Charities that
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
somehow I'm just thinking off the C this
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a we're not going to
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
have time to come to that conclusion I
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
mean I went through this remember I sent
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
this around we we talked about this a
 
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
while ago you know Youth Sports 55 of
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
the Charities are youth
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
Sports uh Lions Club had 31 the
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
different Lions Clubs public libraries
 
01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:17.750 align:start position:0%
different Lions Clubs public libraries
had

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
19 uh religious organizations had 18 I
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
mean I can go through you know it's all
 
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
over the place but not all the are
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
created equal I mean they're not all uh
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
we call them Charities first off that's
 
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
a misnomer it's it's it's not for profit
 
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
organizations it's not charitable or
 
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
they're not for-profit
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
organizations I mean it's a misnomer the
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
titling of the whole thing I mean it's
 
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
charal gaming uh but a lot of these
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
organizations will like L all the
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
various clubs they they they raise money
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
for other organizations we understand
 
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
that that are true charities
 
01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.470 align:start position:0%
that that are true charities
um

01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
so with that said I think yeah there's
 
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a problem coming I I
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
talked about the Nash they showed the
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
numbers on the
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
Nash that that you know pretty soon two
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
two two would not is not going to be
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
enough or or or these Charities when 10
 
01:03:14.589 --> 01:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
days are going to get
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
300,000 now maybe there's some that that
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
are worthy of getting 300,000 but you
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
know there it's it's and again it's we
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
we're really into the mode of big places
 
01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
now and little places there's total two
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
different discussions the little places
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
are probably okay the way we're doing
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
things the bigger places I don't know
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're really I don't think there's
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
enough time for us to address the second
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
part of the of Tim's question because it
 
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
becomes it's a difficult one believe it
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
or not you know we got we got more
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
Charities lining up wanting to be
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
involved how do we get them
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
involved uh one way is to cap that
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
because we know the revenue is going to
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
grow especially in the big places
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
um and then and then and then then means
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
more Charities now you can do it in
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
different ways you could have a third
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
charity or you could just say okay
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
someone has to make a
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
decision that this is really a charity
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
and this one is well I don't know you
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
know why why does the you know the
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
public library gets public money but the
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
public libraries have 19 of these that
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
are that are probably have a foundation
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
or something around them as well uh how
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
much do they need do they need another
 
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
150 for a small town Library probably
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
not um so we have to somehow um come up
 
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
with a way of
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
categorizing these Charities and that's
 
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
that's that'll take a long time to do I
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
tried to at least show what we have now
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
but to say who's who's Worthy is not
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
worthy becomes a problem to try to
 
01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
say um you know any division it's
 
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
probably easier to do it in the uniform
 
01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.750 align:start position:0%
probably easier to do it in the uniform
way

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know it takes the
 
01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
because certainly don't want the
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
individual charal locations to to be
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
involved in coming up with their own
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
rules on this either no looking at your
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
list again and when you mentioned again
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh Town operations a lot of them again
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
if you want are
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
auxiliaries like libraries Friends of
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
the library they are they are not
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
Municipal um if you want no I understand
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
that I know that they're friends of and
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
all that right yeah right and they're
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
fundraising to get more books or
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
whatever more reading room or whatever
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
you know we understand that
 
01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
so so regarding the first charge again
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
how how Charities is selected I think
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
the recommendation can just be that uh
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
Charities are currently selected locally
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
by the gaming operators um and that that
 
01:05:52.029 --> 01:05:52.039 align:start position:0%
that works well for the Charities
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
because it creates a geographical and a
 
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
community of interest for the Charities
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
that are local to that to that gaming
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
operation and that should be our first
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
you can I pause you right there so in
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
the historic racing Bill we we put some
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
language about um and it's a it's it's a
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
not a
 
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
shall it's a should I think that if they
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
can find local
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
charities they get preference but they
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
can still invite other charities in if
 
01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
right it's making sure we understand
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
that right and I and I and again I think
 
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
that's working I think that's working
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
the way it should it's done by local and
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
that and it's about the local it's
 
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
really by U uh what do you call it
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
districts the five U ex coun right which
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's kind of those
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
districts are kind of funny so I don't
 
01:06:40.349 --> 01:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
know why we picked that but you know in
 
01:06:42.269 --> 01:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
terms of some go from one end of the
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
state to the other uh so I'm just trying
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
to again number one how they're selected
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
locally and is with with an eye towards
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
um being Geographic and and of local
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
community interest and then the second
 
01:06:56.829 --> 01:06:56.839 align:start position:0%
half is should the process be uniform
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
and my an I think the committee's answer
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
should be yes and that Lottery should um
 
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
Sorry Charlie Charlie's head just
 
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
snapped up really fast um that Lottery
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
should should review that and see what
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
and take a deeper dive into how that
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
looks and whether or not it needs to be
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
a regulatory or legislative solution to
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
create a uniform process so that Nash is
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing that Conway's doing
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
in the selection I think to relieve of
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
Charlie of having to deal with that is
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
that I think I think we need I think we
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
need to have another commission just to
 
01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
specifically but I'm not talking about
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
the revenue side I'm strictly talking
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
about why am I picking charity you know
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
what what process right this talks about
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
process what's the process for charity a
 
01:07:40.109 --> 01:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
what's the process for Charity B and why
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
would I pick charity a versus Charity B
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
and what do they both go through the
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
same process in order to get selected
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
the simple process not I think number
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
six on your thing is all about the
 
01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:51.799 align:start position:0%
revenue and that and the size and scope
 
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
and whether you have small Charities or
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
large Charities and what that looks like
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
is a future but I think just for this to
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's a consistent
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
process from One gaming operator to
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
another on the selection to make sure
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
the forms are all the same and all of
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
that is is uniform then again I think
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
that's something Charlie could probably
 
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
do regulatory before did you want
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
to so but I think we should take we
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
should take the size of the operation as
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
a separate item and let that deal
 
01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
with thank you I would I would suggest
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
that not to put it on the lottery but
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
have the locations to a committee let's
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
say five people that select the
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
Charities you write who they are we you
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
know the lottery can dictate who should
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
be on there um and then we keep minutes
 
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
example done on a COR will be just a
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
thought and we just submit it I I mean
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
certainly it would make sense if a
 
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
uniform process Statewide um
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
and have it be done through Ru making so
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
that it has the force a law I mean that
 
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
does make a lot of sense one of the
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
difficulties is going to be with the
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
addition of and I don't disagree with
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
the logic of having a room that say
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
makes $250,000 a a week having four
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
Charities versus two that does increase
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
our workload as well as the operator's
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
workload so um and I we talk about doing
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
that as a separate outside outside of
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
the five recommendations I mean
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
certainly as you can imagine when we do
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
Ru making we always SE public input and
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
if there's a committee set up by the
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
operators that wants to have input we
 
01:09:34.829 --> 01:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
obviously you know when we did Ru making
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
for historic horse R in the first place
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
I think we took 47 meetings uh so it's
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
not as if we did we ignored it was very
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
much so the B would just be that have
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
Lottery look at it any needed ruem right
 
01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
so I did have a thought on that too I
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
think it's unnecessary because you're
 
01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:53.799 align:start position:0%
allowed to give Charities up to 10 days
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
and there's two a day so you can easily
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
take a small charity and you know we've
 
01:09:59.709 --> 01:09:59.719 align:start position:0%
partnered with some in the past where
 
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
they get 3 days and that's because we
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
feel their need fits those amount of
 
01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
days so I think it's definitely in the
 
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
purview of the property and if we did
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
say you have to have a committee and you
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
put that thought into it on how many
 
01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
days they're getting and why yeah that's
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
really not the the logic isn't that
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
you're you you using a bad process it's
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
just you're not using the same process
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
everyone else is exactly and so the the
 
01:10:26.669 --> 01:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
difficulty is a uniform process so at
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
least that's the foundation for the
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
start of a uniform application which we
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
don't have so okay and it's really hard
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
to predict like what they're going to
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
make in the
 
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
week up and down the rumors that are
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
coming online are much much larger and
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to have other issues and
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
candidly aren't here um you know neither
 
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
of them are here so those two facilities
 
01:10:50.669 --> 01:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
will equal what is now in existence in
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
the state they'll quite double the
 
01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
capacity so um it's worth it where the
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
review so the second point on this this
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
this one is going to be that we should
 
01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
have some uh rules uh for uniformity of
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
process for a selection of of uh
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
Charities uh and that now when when
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
you're developing the rules you'll
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
you'll publicly announce that or you
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
would let yeah the Charities know the uh
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
the facilities know if they want to
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
participate in that discussion yeah I
 
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
mean as it works now because the Lottery
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
Commission is actually a commission we
 
01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
have public hearings even before there's
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and so our body has to
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
approve it before it even gets to a jail
 
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
car different from other agencies so you
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
you would reach out you would reach out
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
to all the facilities to say hey we're
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
doing the rules on this it all affects
 
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
all of you uh all the
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
facilities I think I just heard vals
 
01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.830 align:start position:0%
facilities I think I just heard vals
resignation

01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
resignation
 
01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.629 align:start position:0%
resignation
but

01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
oh I was wondering why you were speaking
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
so freely about
 
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
she's still here she's still here good
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
she's still here um yeah so yes it would
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
be very much a public process and it
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
would not be quick I mean it wouldn't be
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
rule making itself as you all are well
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
aware it takes you know months not weeks
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
then eventually 18 Min right and then it
 
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
winds up in jail car yeah and then the
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
jail car there's always the public input
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
the HHR rules were right contentious
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
jail car all right sorry Mr chairman if
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
right right but what what I think I hear
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
G saying is that I think the uh the
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
various facilities probably have a lot
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
of ideas on this one and that before you
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
even do that that they'd like to meet
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
and and and throw some ideas to help
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
help you guys out yeah no it's also when
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
to get consensus it's we're looking for
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
the super majority not unanimity right
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
well you're never going to get 100% un
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know I'm trying here but this is
 
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
hard so um okay I think we got I think
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
we got those one set good ideas good
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
discussion uh when it comes to the um Mr
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
chairman yes yeah I think the waiting
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
list is also one of the items to kind of
 
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
put in there that there should be some
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
published waiting list so that you don't
 
01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
have a charity if you want on 10 10
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
different would anybody object to that
 
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
because I have I'm asked this all the
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
time people call me and say well which
 
01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
charity has a date there's no central
 
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
place for that people to go to find out
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
who's got dates available uniquely I
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
think this ties into the municipality
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
piece where our like in Nasha they're
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
very happy because we we do help out
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
like the NASA soup kitchen so it's not
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
like a first in line you get a turn
 
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
especially because you have to determine
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
how many days the charity gets based on
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
their needs I think it's important to
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
leave that partnership to give back to
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
the community that you're hosting in so
 
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think like a one big
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
waiting list well that's that's part of
 
01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
that's a good suggestion if you want
 
01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
Community it's a tearing there's going
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
to be a tearing what who who's the top
 
01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
priority who's the next
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
priority if if I would just oppose the
 
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
one waiting list for the whole state I
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
think like you have a waiting list but I
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
don't think it's like a first in line
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
sort of deal you look at the need what
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
they need who they are you don't want
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
people just building nonprofits and like
 
01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
signing up and then getting their turn
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
and line type of thing just to get the
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
money you want to put thought into their
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
cause their mission their programs does
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
it make sense to part partner
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
together again the whole state doesn't
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
have locations you know a lot of the
 
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
North Country really isn't covered um go
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
ahead dick
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
um well it's a good discussion of a
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
difficult problem uh and one aspect of
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
it is what I would call fairness and uh
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
participate on equal footing with with
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
all others and uh the the truth of the
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
matter is that the big casinos are being
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
developed right on the bottom
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
bottom edge of uh this state and um if
 
01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:36.910 align:start position:0%
bottom edge of uh this state and um if
you're

01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
up in uh Berlin or other towns uh far
 
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
away um from
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
casinos they won't
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
um be considered
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
when the local casino the big Casino you
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
know is is trying to reach out and be
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
helpful to the local soup kitchen cuz
 
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
they're not local they're up there and
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
um and that's not going to change I mean
 
01:16:08.629 --> 01:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
we've got for one thing we've got a
 
01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
moratorium uh for another it's just the
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
market and U and yet the money is uh
 
01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
pouring into these facilities and how
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
can we reach for fairness so
 
01:16:25.229 --> 01:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
so of those who are otherwise in have
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
equal needs can be um have an equal
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
place in the game and
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
um uh in looking at one of these charts
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
that I got maybe at the beginning of
 
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
this process or maybe before we began
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
this process that
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
shows charity Revenue by month uh it
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
just struck me that uh on the very first
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
page you got the American Legion posts
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
you got about 20 of them
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
and uh on this page one of them is into
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
his is getting historic horse racing
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
revenues getting more money than anybody
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
else and um another page has the BFW and
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh in the same picture my own town
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
actually that post got lucky and they're
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
getting uh uh historic horse racing or
 
01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
maybe they were quick on their feet I
 
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
don't really know um and uh and the
 
01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
others are not so you know they're sort
 
01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
of the same thing they're obviously very
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
different and each one would be proud of
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
how of their differences but uh uh it's
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
a big issue and and it used to be not
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
such a big issue because there wasn't as
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
much money everything was sort of small
 
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
time and local in a sense right now we
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
got a lot of money and it becomes a
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
different responsibility for us as a
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
state than it was before right actually
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
in my in my other list that we're going
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
to get to start today anyway hopefully
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I I when it came to
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
the number of facilities I put a
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
caveat I said you know we have the 19
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
but the caveat was
 
01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
location you know do we want to make an
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
exception to somebody up north because
 
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
we know where they did a nice job of
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
putting on the on in their report where
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
all the locations were clearly up north
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
you know what if what if Lincoln wanted
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
to open one or whatever
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I know Co I know you've been
 
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
fighting your town which is Littleton
 
01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
Littleton uh but but but you know if we
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
if it's I think somehow when these rul
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
making we have to consider Charities up
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
north to say that we need to have a
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
certain percentage or something that we
 
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
we we providing coverage to other
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
Charities not just the ones that are in
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
the Southern Tier
 
01:18:58.590 --> 01:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
because you know because you're right
 
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
they all the big ones were opening South
 
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
for logical reasons I mean they're all
 
01:19:04.629 --> 01:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
opening down here and I think the
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
disparity in the need the northern the
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
northern counties the Northern
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
Communities and I give you an
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
example give you an example trate the
 
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
community action program that Services
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
the North country has desperate needs
 
01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation needs housing needs
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
feeding needs that are much different
 
01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
than the needs that occur in the South
 
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
and where are all the facilities the all
 
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
of the facilities are gravitating to the
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
South but by the time it's over and and
 
01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
uh I I I wonder who's who who will be
 
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
taking over whom in the final analysis
 
01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
but where is the action clearly what
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
spectrum told us is if you want to
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
expand you do the following things and
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
you get closer to the Massachusetts
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
border because that's where the people
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
are and that's where the activity takes
 
01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.189 align:start position:0%
are and that's where the activity takes
place

01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
so the point equitable distribution for
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
Charities the Charities of the north
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
have extreme needs and and we we can't
 
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
answer those I mean try to answer those
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
needs through general fund
 
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations but but indeed that that
 
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
isn't happening so I mean the like the
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
Conway situation I can understand that I
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
lived in Conway I I know what the needs
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
in kway are there's the very very rich
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
in kway and the very very poor in cway
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
so you're going to address maybe some of
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
some of those needs but equality in
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
terms of addressing need is going to
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
become the issue because the pot is
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
growing it's just growing by virtue of
 
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
of of the fact that that more people are
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
participating in the in the game but as
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
the pot grows those who are who are in
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the area that are close are going to
 
01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
get more they're there they got in there
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
early what about the people in the North
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
or other the people at that that have
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
the need that that's becoming a a that's
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
becoming a significant concern I would
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
think the not for-profits would be
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about that and certainly from
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
your standpoint that's got to be a
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
concern and and remember that that we as
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
a state we have made these opportunities
 
01:21:16.719 --> 01:21:17.629 align:start position:0%
a state we have made these opportunities
more

01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
attractive longer hours 8:00 in the
 
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
morning to 4:00 in the evening uh talked
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
talked about we've increased we've
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
increased the BET we've done a lot of
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
other things here to to make it a better
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
situation for the investor all right I
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not opposed to that but but indeed
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
when you're addressing the need the need
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
there is glaring need that isn't being
 
01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
addressed now now do you bring the pot
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
so that some of it goes that way I I
 
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
don't know I do think that's going to
 
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
have to be addressed in in the future
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
because as the facilities grow and as
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
they gravitate to the southern part of
 
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
the state that's where the that's where
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen thank you Mr JJ you
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
had a question I will mention like we
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
definitely have statewide Partners like
 
01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
for sure but I'm saying if the Nashville
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
soup kitchen comes I know that's like a
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
community need like in Nasha of course
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to partner with them for an
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
example if the front door agency Family
 
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
Promise of Southern New Hampshire of
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
course we're going to want to partner
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
with them but we have have statewide
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
Partners 100% and everybody has that
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
option that selection but I do think
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
it's important much to the municipality
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
piece I mean we saw the Spectrum report
 
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
The Operators technically it's not all
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
tax but it's the highest in the nation
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
as it is so at 45% so the Charities are
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
doing great and I think it's a good
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
thing and I think it's great we went
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
from one to two even though some of the
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
rooms some of the Charities probably
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
make less than the to make on the
 
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
smaller rooms for sure but you know
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
we're at the point that we've evened out
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
ours made less in the beginning as well
 
01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
which was a hard discussion to have with
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
them but I totally hear what you're
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
saying I don't disagree I just think if
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
we want to help the community that the
 
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
operators are actually operating out of
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
and give back I think it's it's okay
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
to select
 
01:23:24.669 --> 01:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
them I don't think it should be you know
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
same with grants in the state like I
 
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
don't understand why some of the grants
 
01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
go and I don't know why they're divided
 
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
the way they are when I'm on through
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
nonprofit boards I don't get any
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
transparency on where the money is or
 
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
where it goes so I'm I'm supportive of
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
the transparency of a committee this is
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
how we select them this is how many days
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
they're getting this is why but I think
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
it's an overreach to demand that you're
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
giving to certain areas or certain
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
Charities I I I don't think I'm not
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
talking about it to me I'm just talking
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
about the recognizing of need and and in
 
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
recognizing need if there not an entity
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
in place that can address that need
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
somehow some way it's either a general
 
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.470 align:start position:0%
somehow some way it's either a general
fund

01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation or or there's a mechanism
 
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
in place whereby you share the wealth
 
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
that's all I agreed with the need I
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
think the need's always going to for the
 
01:24:20.669 --> 01:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofit sector it always outweighs
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
what you have so I think for this one we
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
we decided that
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
that um that we're going to we're going
 
01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
to we're going to push this off to
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
rules and uh and that there'll be
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
notices out when the rule creation
 
01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
process begins and that the all of the
 
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
facilities will be
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
notified that that we're going to start
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
this process and you can all input at
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
that point in time it's kind of like
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
kicking the down the road a little here
 
01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
but I think that's for time purposes no
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
November 1 is around is coming upon us
 
01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
so um so for this one I think
 
01:25:03.679 --> 01:25:06.990 align:start position:0%
so um so for this one I think
um

01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
um uniform process okay so we're
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
addressing the first one the commission
 
01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
shall examine how Charities are selected
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
and whether a uniform process should
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
exist right now we know it's the local
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
Chari uh facilities and most have people
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
like Gia who
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh is in charge of selecting their the
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
Charities that come before them uh and
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
just a I'm not in charge I actually
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
don't even typically vote on it we have
 
01:25:39.709 --> 01:25:39.719 align:start position:0%
a committee and I
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
present all of the Charities that have
 
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
applied you know for the past two years
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
and I can make recommendations but we
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
have a committee that what I meant to
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
say then is that seems like each of
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
these facilities has a charity
 
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
coordinator type position position oh oh
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely to help guide them through
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
the paperwork make sure everything's
 
01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
good I do do that I do do that I correct
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
you just said I was in charge of
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
selecting them so I wanted to no okay
 
01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
clarify so so but so the the question on
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
the table and the the the other piece
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
which is the amount and increasing the
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
number of Charities through some other
 
01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
process I think that has to be a
 
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
separate commission to do that CU that
 
01:26:26.669 --> 01:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
that's going to be to see here in this
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
conversation but but to get some
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
uniformity of the of how things are
 
01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
currently going in terms of of how who
 
01:26:37.870 --> 01:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
how the Charities are
 
01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
selected uh we're looking at a um rules
 
01:26:44.830 --> 01:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
doing that and with the
 
01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.669 align:start position:0%
doing that and with the
input

01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
input
 
01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
um without additional leg legislation
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
are you saying that that this is
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
something Lottery can already do
 
01:26:58.109 --> 01:26:58.119 align:start position:0%
so I think if I if I can clarify so I
 
01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
think there's two pieces right so the
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
first piece again how they're selected
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
they're selected locally we I don't
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
think we make any recommendation to that
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
change of how the charity is selected
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
locally um and then the second piece is
 
01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:13.639 align:start position:0%
the process in which they use and that
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
process can be uniformed and can be done
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
through rules with
 
01:27:20.830 --> 01:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
lottery I think that's the and but the
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
question is we don't need legislation to
 
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
do that correct both those things would
 
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
not need legislation ones and no you're
 
01:27:29.229 --> 01:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
a jail car guy so I'm asking question
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
really and Charlie do you feel you've
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
got what you need for what's been talked
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
about I do but realize that the the the
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
process will be process heavy not sub
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
substantive heavy if that makes sense
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
like we'll get a uniform process but it
 
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
won't be picking winners and losers it
 
01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
won't say this charity or that charity
 
01:27:50.109 --> 01:27:50.119 align:start position:0%
has value versus not value or a tearing
 
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
system I don't expect to do that at all
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
just I mean literally this is the first
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
step of uniform processes that's what I
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
I I was going to say I think that is a
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable First Step yeah exactly right
 
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
okay so so let's um let's vote on this
 
01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:07.590 align:start position:0%
okay so so let's um let's vote on this
then

01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
um um local charities we're not we're
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
not changing that local charities are
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
going to continue to uh to facilities uh
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
childood Gaming facilities are going to
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
continue to pick their um
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
Charities but at the same time we're
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
going to create um some additional rules
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
around that to get a little more
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
uniformity uh and that will be through
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
Lottery and and all of the facilities
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
will be notified as that process
 
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
begins um so with that um all in favor
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
of that say I I
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
opposed and
 
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
no he abstains s jumping up and down now
 
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
now now the other so this this covers
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
the things on this list but um of the of
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
the of the
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
statute but but I'm also we'll be also
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
recommending and you'll see when I for
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
our next meeting I'm going to write some
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
of this up and then we can all see the
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
language but I'll I'll add to that
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
asking for another commission to address
 
01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
the larger issue of how much is enough
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
you know is 15,000 to that to be you
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
know that and
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
then how do we how do we deal with the
 
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
growth when it comes to the revenues
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
going to the Charities and how much how
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
much revenue should be should there be
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
ceiling no ceiling you know all of that
 
01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
so we we I'll have language that we can
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
we can vote on then so the second piece
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
we have a half hour left so I want to go
 
01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:43.639 align:start position:0%
to this other document that I I sent out
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
what I tried to do was to
 
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
summarize some of the things from the
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
report and other things from
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
the uh from from our
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
meetings um I want to start I want to go
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of this list I'm not going
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
to go in any particular order here but
 
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to see what we can accomplish
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
in the next half
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
hour uh now uh our AG is not
 
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
here uh so number
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
24 should we have a waiver this was on
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
page 43 of the spectrum report it was
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't really make recommendations
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
they made suggestions I would call it
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
should we have a waiver of of
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
qualification for institutional
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
investors holding their ownership
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
interest in publicly traded companies
 
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
for Passive investment purposes only I
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
think we hold on that one until we have
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
um the the assistant AG here uh in the
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
next meeting but the one the next one
 
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
should we have a regulatory scheme for
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
licensing the vendors who conduct with
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
our charity charitable Gaming facilities
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
and this is the way he phras the phrase
 
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:55.719 align:start position:0%
that it's little award and Supply gaming
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
with our charal Gaming facilities and
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
Supply gaming equipment and other
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
related services so what that means
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
is do we want to do we want to charge a
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
fee it seems like the industry Norm is
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
that to regulate the machine
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that are here in the state
 
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
the totalizer company I guess as well it
 
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
seems like others do charge a fee for
 
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
this uh so that you know Charlie just
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
left but um it it seems like this
 
01:31:31.149 --> 01:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
something might be appropriate that we
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
we um have a recommendation around
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
this uh that we
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
actually do something uh to charge a fee
 
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
to to help offset the regul rate of
 
01:31:49.229 --> 01:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
Regulation costs of Lottery to to
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
monitor these these
 
01:31:56.189 --> 01:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
things so discussion on that one it's
 
01:31:59.070 --> 01:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
a because again the only the only the
 
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
only fee that's charged is
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
$750 a year which is another one of my
 
01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
bullets here by the
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
way I I I don't know where it is here
 
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.310 align:start position:0%
way I I I don't know where it is here
now

01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
but to me you
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
know I guess there were some some some
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
states didn't have any fee at all and
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
but we and there's clearly no entry fee
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
for for new Charities to come in um
 
01:32:32.189 --> 01:32:32.199 align:start position:0%
and um it just seems to me that well
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
let's discuss it I mean am IA the only
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
one that thinks it may be appropriate to
 
01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
to tr charge a license fee I think
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
Charlie in one meeting said he he he
 
01:32:43.149 --> 01:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
would would consider
 
01:32:43.159 --> 01:32:45.709 align:start position:0%
would would consider
that

01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:45.719 --> 01:32:47.750 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
um she left too all right uh so so okay
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
now I'm speechless so no no no comment
 
01:32:59.229 --> 01:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
on it I I think it's something we have
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
to look at look at uh as the original
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the gaming legislation we
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
assessed a very substantial fee uh to
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
get to get a license and we had we
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
developed a program of how those how
 
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
those revenues would be dispensed to to
 
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
the state to the local communities and
 
01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
to to uh anyone who was involved in in
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
the process now
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
the 700 I don't know where the $750 came
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
from but but it's a bit whacked in my
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
opinion uh so that's something we have
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
to look at and look at the uh the work
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
that now goes to the Lottery Commission
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
and and what has to what has to be done
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
there does the $750 cover that charie is
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
he still here or is he out Charlie step
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
out he stepped out well I mean
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
there there's there there's got to be a
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh there's got to be some thought given
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
given here uh about that it's about the
 
01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
tears if you have a facility that's this
 
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
large should they be paying a a fee a a
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
smaller facility should they be paying
 
01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
aisy it's got to be a graduated scale
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we we kind of created a graduated
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
scale when we said more than one
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
facility would be put in place but I I
 
01:34:26.109 --> 01:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
think I I believe it's something that
 
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
that has to be that has to be looked at
 
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.669 align:start position:0%
that has to be that has to be looked at
U

01:34:30.669 --> 01:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
U
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
and there from what we gathered from
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
Spectrum there's nothing but growth here
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
this thing is growing and and as it
 
01:34:44.189 --> 01:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
grows it'll become more complicated to
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
deal with from a from a regulation level
 
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
as I say we got one situation that has
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
developed which is going to go on it
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
seems to be forever
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
if they don't if they if that that isn't
 
01:34:59.950 --> 01:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
settled then then I I I think what we're
 
01:35:03.149 --> 01:35:03.159 align:start position:0%
talking about is it doesn't have any
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
relevance and I I I don't think we're
 
01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
talking about an entry fee at this point
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
U because the 19 up to 19
 
01:35:14.669 --> 01:35:14.679 align:start position:0%
facilities all would have entered in the
 
01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
old all even if we had an entry fee uh
 
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
there was no entry fee and it wouldn't
 
01:35:22.590 --> 01:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
be fair to anybody new having to pay you
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
know $100,000 200 thou 300,000 million
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
to to come in here it's just not right
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
because they'd have to amortize it it
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you know they probably wouldn't
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
come but um so I just talking about the
 
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
the annual fee and I think they should
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
be maybe tiered for the smaller place
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
would be less the bigger places should
 
01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:45.270 align:start position:0%
would be less the bigger places should
be

01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
more um and you know maybe the smaller
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
places keep the 750 but the bigger
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
places we're talking about more so
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about Charlie
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
I I you know that um that's number one
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
and the other should there be a fee to
 
01:36:06.189 --> 01:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
the vendors of the the the machine
 
01:36:08.109 --> 01:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturers probably the to in our
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
case the totalizer companies for doing
 
01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire which seems to
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
be a common practice in other
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
states if I didn't unless I misheard
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
what spectrum was saying that let's
 
01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
start with that one I mean do we want to
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
even have anything in the report about
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
this is my question to everybody I
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
personally think we should but I can be
 
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:36.679 align:start position:0%
our voted here on this one yeah U thank
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman the first people in paid
 
01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
a certain fee anybody that wants to come
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
in now has a lot more data to go by
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
because the risk for the first group of
 
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
people coming in was higher than a risk
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
from somebody coming in now somebody
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
coming and now can look at the whole
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
state where can I put my Casino how much
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
can I expect to make I think their risk
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
is higher at the very beginning when
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
there were no casinos it was rolling a
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
dice we're going to sink a lot of money
 
01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
in here are we going to make it or not I
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
just think there's
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
more educated or uh data out there now
 
01:37:18.109 --> 01:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
for somebody to come in and chose pay
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
any dollar you're saying other other
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
things but they didn't pay any dollar
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
entry fee to be here
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm talking about an entry
 
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
fee but I'm not and again I'm not
 
01:37:30.109 --> 01:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we do an entry fee
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
because it's too late I mean the do
 
01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
door's been wide open for a long time
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
and everybody's walked through it it's
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
never too late so we made it very
 
01:37:42.109 --> 01:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
attractive whether we knew it or not
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
basically it was very attractive to come
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
here so
 
01:37:50.669 --> 01:37:50.679 align:start position:0%
um so that one I'm not talking about I'm
 
01:37:55.229 --> 01:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
talking about the the annual fees to to
 
01:37:58.430 --> 01:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
again the r renewal renewal license fees
 
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
start with that one the renewal license
 
01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
fees 750 bucks a
 
01:38:07.629 --> 01:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
year you know so I mean the brook the
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
nashille place the the now the propos
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
the the the ones that Lou rattled off
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
the larger
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
places that's chump change
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
$750 um is is that cover any why do we
 
01:38:22.589 --> 01:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
have license fees in the first place you
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
used to be in ways and means we used to
 
01:38:27.149 --> 01:38:27.159 align:start position:0%
talk about it covering the cost of
 
01:38:30.669 --> 01:38:30.679 align:start position:0%
Regulation now in in Lottery's
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
case it you know it comes out of the net
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
what the state gets is the net of the
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
after expenses you know the state gets
 
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
their their portion of the
 
01:38:44.109 --> 01:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
revenues Charlie Pays His expenses out
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
of that and then whatever is left it's
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
just like like liquor goes to the
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
state so it's a little bit different but
 
01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:54.430 align:start position:0%
state so it's a little bit different but
um

01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
but so in in reality that they the
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
percentage that the state gets from the
 
01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
from the gross Gaming revenue is
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
covering expenses I understand that but
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me that there should be
 
01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
$750 just a suggestion
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
um I think we're a little bit in the
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
dark here we don't know the cost of of
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
Regulation right as we sit here and um
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
yet it seems likely that $750 isn't
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
covering that cost um but uh if we could
 
01:39:39.790 --> 01:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
go through if we could specify in
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
response to this question this item that
 
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
uh we Rec we we recommend that a process
 
01:39:49.709 --> 01:39:49.719 align:start position:0%
be established I don't know whether the
 
01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed for this or not to
 
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.390 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed for this or not to
review

01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
the sufficiency of the fee structure to
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
support the cost of Regulation something
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
like that um at least we get off the
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
dime here and uh have recognized that
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's something that needs to be
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
looked at so and you know we just talked
 
01:40:13.229 --> 01:40:13.239 align:start position:0%
with uh on the previous issue about uh
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
setting up going through a regulatory
 
01:40:17.709 --> 01:40:17.719 align:start position:0%
process that relates to the regulation
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
of this system that we've got here and
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh that's going to cost money um but do
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
we add into that then the number 25 uh
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh equipment manufacturers yeah right
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
and the and the total lator people and
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
that could be a part of the review
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
process and any new uh fees that uh
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
might might be I'm trying to be all
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
inclusive in this commission it's you
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
know that we at least discussed it yeah
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
um so again I go back to a reminder in
 
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
the in the Spectrum report they talk
 
01:40:55.709 --> 01:40:55.719 align:start position:0%
about where the highest tax rate of any
 
01:40:58.830 --> 01:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
state in revenue for here and I I look
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
at as
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
Aames right but I looked at as a
 
01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
short-term versus long-term play right
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
so I think the fees The Upfront fees and
 
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
well I agree with you on things like
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
number 23 which talk about the
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
background investigation fees and maybe
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
we we can do a similar thing to um the
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
the uh renewal fees to be that an actual
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
cost re recoup of an actual cost so some
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
renewal may be simple because the
 
01:41:26.669 --> 01:41:26.679 align:start position:0%
investigate they the operator turns in
 
01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
all the pieces of paper they're all
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
correct right at the first time it's
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
literally just a review and and a stamp
 
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
others like okay I got questions on this
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
and I got questions on this and I got
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
questions on this and I've got a three
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
days worth more of work that I have to
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
do to go get the ant Chase those down so
 
01:41:44.189 --> 01:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
I would be okay with the variable rate
 
01:41:46.109 --> 01:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
that that deals with actual cost because
 
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
remember I think we have a con we have a
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
a a Supreme Court case that talks about
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
fees have to be result of either
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
function of
 
01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
regulation which I think we take care of
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
in our taxes or the functional actual
 
01:41:59.550 --> 01:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
effort which is the renewal process and
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
what that the effort is needed and that
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
they have to be they have to match they
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
can't be a money-making Revenue they
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
have to be the explain costs of the
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
state um and so I would be okay with a
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
variable rate for renewals that deals
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
with the actual effort right and the
 
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
same with the investigation cap here
 
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
that variable rate that deals with um
 
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's for the actual cost of what it is
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
if it's done against the operator does
 
01:42:25.589 --> 01:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
all the work up front and it's all nice
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
and clean Charlie that his staff has to
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
go over it they have no questions
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and they approve it that's
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot less than someone who
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
turned in half an application has a
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of extra work um and they
 
01:42:38.589 --> 01:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
and Lottery has to do a whole bunch of
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
more work to do that so that fee for
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
that person who didn't do all their
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
upfront work should be hired right we I
 
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
remember in Ways and Means we've had
 
01:42:49.870 --> 01:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
these issues come up before about about
 
01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
those that do a good job of of so people
 
01:42:55.950 --> 01:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
Charlie uh they pretty much know how to
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
do it what to do is is that is that just
 
01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
a is that much of a problem for you so
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
Val the folks who actually renew their
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
right so that's not a big issue um how
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
long has the um 50
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
$750 renewal fee been in place again how
 
01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
long has there a
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
place it's
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
before it's before we absorbed racing so
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
it's been there since
 
01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
Lottery okay so just I mean at the most
 
01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
basic level inflation
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
adjusted number probably needs to happen
 
01:43:49.709 --> 01:43:49.719 align:start position:0%
um and then I would also agree that the
 
01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
larger the establishment
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
the more work there's going to be done
 
01:43:56.189 --> 01:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
by the state there there may need to be
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
a sliding scale based on size maybe
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
based on square footage something like
 
01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:02.830 align:start position:0%
based on square footage something like
that

01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
appointment somebody just complexity of
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
ownership too yeah so so there may be
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
some I mean at the most basic level
 
01:44:12.669 --> 01:44:12.679 align:start position:0%
maybe we recommend a higher fee for now
 
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
but obviously further studies needed to
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
know exactly um how a sliding scale
 
01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:19.239 align:start position:0%
would would operate should be some kind
 
01:44:21.550 --> 01:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
of a sliding scale we'll say and and the
 
01:44:24.189 --> 01:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation in that um
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I want to give it to you the
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislature has to deal with that so
 
01:44:31.149 --> 01:44:31.159 align:start position:0%
right so should we make a recommendation
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature that we
 
01:44:36.510 --> 01:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
yeah legisl to was meat or something to
 
01:44:38.589 --> 01:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
yeah it would come that okay why don't
 
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
we do it that way so we'll punt to the
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
legislature on that to come up with
 
01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
something but it's a recommendation that
 
01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
we think that we should all right that's
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
the basic
 
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
fee why don't we handle that one first
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
so so the recommendation is that it's
 
01:44:54.629 --> 01:44:54.639 align:start position:0%
been a while since we've looked at the
 
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
$750 fee uh with the with the places
 
01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:01.639 align:start position:0%
with the CH uh the facilities growing in
 
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
size should uh the question of should
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
there be a variable fee structure uh be
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
put in place yes
 
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
certainly um Revenue estimates for just
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
HHR for the next year are the state's
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
going to yield 26 million I didn't hear
 
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry so that our Revenue
 
01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
estimates for the next fiscal year for
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
HHR is that we're going to yield 26 Mill
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
to the state which more than covers the
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
cost of Regulation so if you factor that
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
in is I know and that's why I caveat
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
that earlier that it was you it's
 
01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
different than any other thing because
 
01:45:36.589 --> 01:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
they generate
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
revenue and it what goes to the state is
 
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
the net so if Charlie feels he needs
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
more well again any any additional staff
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
you would have to get approval from the
 
01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
legislature it's kind of a Kind 22 just
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
just to uh following
 
01:45:55.470 --> 01:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
your uh the information $6 million for
 
01:45:59.550 --> 01:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
HHR in uh the coming year next fiscal
 
01:46:03.149 --> 01:46:03.159 align:start position:0%
year do you have a number for this
 
01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
I put some context so
 
01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
um I did this math just
 
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
recently charitable gambling revenue is
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
up 46% year-over-year 23
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
24 um so for this coming year I think we
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
had plugged in 26 million again for
 
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
short course racing
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
there are a couple facilities which are
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
planned but I
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
fear construction being what it is I'm
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
always fear of planning on places that
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
aren't open yet yeah right and so it's
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
26 million again in the next fiscal year
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
25 yeah but I I would expect that to be
 
01:46:42.189 --> 01:46:42.199 align:start position:0%
low I would expect to exceed 30 sounds
 
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
like you're being conservative on that
 
01:46:45.629 --> 01:46:45.639 align:start position:0%
yeah which is fine because we don't know
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
if there could be construction delays or
 
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
delays in the approval so is your
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
question now the question we're on now
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
um the we're going to leave as a
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
variable left to the legislature to
 
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
figure out how to make that work right
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
but on the I'm going to break these into
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
two questions so in the fee relative to
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
the third party yeah let's can we just
 
01:47:07.589 --> 01:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
stay at the fee you're you're going to
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
the equipment manufacturers is the next
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
one that's right I think we should have
 
01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
a separate a separate one on that so so
 
01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of the basic fee that exists
 
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
today the 750 uh we're going to say to
 
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:19.990 align:start position:0%
today the 750 uh we're going to say to
the

01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
legislature um please take a look at
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
that fee to see if a variable fee makes
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
more sense going forward given that the
 
01:47:29.229 --> 01:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
size of some of these facilities is much
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
greater do do okay that's that's my
 
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
motion uh I so all in favor that say
 
01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
please say yes I yes I no any he knows
 
01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
Charlie D stain okay you can do the work
 
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
all right so then the what really is 25
 
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the licensing of
 
01:47:53.589 --> 01:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
vendors the equipment vendors
 
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
and and the totalizer
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
people um I throw that open it was it
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
was stated in the report that that's the
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
common practice I thought it's worthy of
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
us to
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
discuss um again again Lottery gets
 
01:48:14.189 --> 01:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
plenty of revenue from from the their
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
proceeds but um is there something that
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
we think is worthy because you do do we
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
monitor we let's talk to let's talk to
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers what what what's our
 
01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
oversight responsibility with the
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of the of the uh historic
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
racing machines so we
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't we don't license or or approve of
 
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers but their equipment
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
and math models are submitted for our
 
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
approval uh with a certification from a
 
01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
lab uh and the lab generally is GLI
 
01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
which is gaming Laboratories
 
01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
Incorporated uh which is the gold
 
01:48:48.910 --> 01:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
standard of test labs and so the
 
01:48:51.149 --> 01:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
equipment is tested and verified it's
 
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
just not we don't approve the company
 
01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:54.990 align:start position:0%
just not we don't approve the company
itself

01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
right um so that's verified a
 
01:49:02.589 --> 01:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
bit but okay so you do you feel it's
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
Lottery speaking for
 
01:49:08.109 --> 01:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
lottery um that that we these vendors
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
should be licensed forget about a fee
 
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
for a minute should these these vendors
 
01:49:13.550 --> 01:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
be licensed with the
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
state I mean certain there's no harm in
 
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
it it is extra work obviously because
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
these yeah it yeah should they license
 
01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
yes they should okay but they shouldn't
 
01:49:27.149 --> 01:49:27.159 align:start position:0%
be um no they should be licensed yeah
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
all right how about how about the
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
totalizer people I mean ultimately we
 
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
should probably make it so that every
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
gaming vendor in the state is is
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
licensed right so everyone who provides
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
gaming material whether it be tables
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
machines um should be licensed and then
 
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
the question regarding non-gaming
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
vendors you know if they if you know
 
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
Supply bread or you know roast beef I
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
don't think those folks list gaming
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
gaming related so
 
01:49:57.149 --> 01:49:57.159 align:start position:0%
discussion I me so I know we haven't
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
talked about this it came up in the
 
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
report that's all that's why I'm
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
bringing it up so I'm going to go back I
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
tend to be against that idea and again
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
the reason being is we're getting our
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue I don't what Charlie's approving
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
these through GLI that the functionality
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
so the question comes we don't we don't
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
charge Ford to bring cars in Hampshire
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
we charge a dealer for when they sell
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
cars in New Hampshire um we don't charge
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer money right so I don't
 
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
know why we would possibly do this if
 
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
we're already validating the information
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
we're getting our revenue from the
 
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
machines already that are in the state
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess I'm still struggling is
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
what's the value to the manufacturer
 
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
other than they get to put their
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
machines in the Hampshire um what is New
 
01:50:42.069 --> 01:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire providing as a regulatory uh
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
structure not doing anything right it's
 
01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
being evaluated by another organization
 
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
right so again there's no value to a
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire other than I
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
get to put my machine here just like
 
01:50:52.990 --> 01:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
Ford gets to put their car of the
 
01:50:55.149 --> 01:50:55.159 align:start position:0%
dealers um and I just don't know why we
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
would license that what what the
 
01:50:59.069 --> 01:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
function what is the state interest in
 
01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
licensing it if we're already getting
 
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
certified Labs from the gold standard
 
01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
lab that the machine is functional for
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
the state um and functional for use
 
01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
Nationwide um what what's the value to
 
01:51:11.069 --> 01:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire why do we do it other than
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
just to create revenue and yet no to me
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
that's not a
 
01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
reason all right so I tend to agree with
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
you Tim on this one actually but I bring
 
01:51:21.870 --> 01:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
it up because it was in the report that
 
01:51:23.550 --> 01:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
was in the report that
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
we um I mean we could say that we
 
01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
discuss this and that at this time we
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary step to take
 
01:51:36.030 --> 01:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
is everybody okay with
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
so unless you make a compelling argument
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
Charlie that at this point can you live
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
without it well of course yeah I mean
 
01:51:50.189 --> 01:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
it's not as if that then the world will
 
01:51:50.199 --> 01:51:51.109 align:start position:0%
it's not as if that then the world will
fall

01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
fall
 
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
obviously the machines are tested and
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
certified for equipment like if the
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturers want to move equipment
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
they have to get our approval so it's
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
not as if there's no regulation it's
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
just the standard practice in the
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
industry is to have gaming vendors
 
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
licensed in
 
01:52:08.910 --> 01:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
state so I don't know that's not I don't
 
01:52:10.830 --> 01:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
think that's compelling at least with
 
01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:13.030 align:start position:0%
think that's compelling at least with
you

01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
folks

01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
well I'll say okay we we could just keep
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
it neutral for now um in the report that
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
we discussed it um I agree with that
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
keep it neutral no recommendation on
 
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
this one okay so uh all all in favor of
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
saying that we we keep things the way
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
they are related to this issue uh say I
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
I anybody opposed
 
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
okay yeah your extion really came
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
through on this
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
one let's go to
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
23 um the backup investigation fees
 
01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
Captain then I know our Assistant
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
Attorney General weighed in on this
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
at last meeting I won't speak well I
 
01:52:57.870 --> 01:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
guess I'm speaking for him um he thought
 
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
that it it should be whatever those fees
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
are uh this is for new people
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
entering in our Market uh that those
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
investigation fees should not be capped
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
at 5,000 they should be
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
unlimited does anybody agree or disagree
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
with that statement I agree I agree with
 
01:53:20.910 --> 01:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
that in most of our legislation we never
 
01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
had cap it was what cost and that they
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
pay the total fees that's always been
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
the the basic premise of how we
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
investigate how we investigate people so
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't where did the
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
$5,000 limit go through I don't know he
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
gave the RSA 287d 11 Roman
 
01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
4 so um okay so we we we'll make a
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislature I just Mr chair one question
 
01:53:53.709 --> 01:53:53.719 align:start position:0%
um is there any um I mean obviously it
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
makes sense for the cost to be covered
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
but at the same time does this open the
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
door for I don't know an agency who
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to see somebody come in
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
potentially say well we're still
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
investigating now we have to do this I
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know I I think we've I
 
01:54:09.870 --> 01:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
remember in Ways and Means we've had
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
these discussions before but and I can't
 
01:54:16.750 --> 01:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
remember now what um where all the fees
 
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
are paid so I think there's precedent
 
01:54:21.069 --> 01:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
for other other areas not just in
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
lottery for this
 
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
and I think di was saying I mean u l you
 
01:54:27.550 --> 01:54:27.560 align:start position:0%
was saying that right that there's
 
01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
precedent for this yes okay well it's
 
01:54:33.069 --> 01:54:33.079 align:start position:0%
been pres in numerous pieces of
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
legislation that have been brought
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
forward that the total cost will be
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
paid and I I I could I me agree you you
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
can say that there a cause concern but I
 
01:54:47.069 --> 01:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
think that have confidence in the fact
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
that the guys who are doing
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
investigation are doing the
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
investigation and we're not we're not
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
overdoing it
 
01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
you got to have some trust in
 
01:54:58.069 --> 01:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
that so there is the recommendation is
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
that the legislature will take a look at
 
01:55:02.470 --> 01:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
RSA 287d colon
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
11 Roman
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
4 which caps the $5,000 to take the cap
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
away and make it uh a fee based on the
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
actual cost of doing the
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
investigation okay any other discussion
 
01:55:22.109 --> 01:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
on that so just a quick uh recommend
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
that be in our report say I I I anybody
 
01:55:25.679 --> 01:55:27.149 align:start position:0%
that be in our report say I I I anybody
oppose

01:55:27.149 --> 01:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
01:55:27.159 --> 01:55:29.550 align:start position:0%
oppose
abstain

01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
abstain
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
okay all right I'm going to go we have
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
five eight minutes left on my watch
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
let's go to some of the easier ones for
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
now we're going to reconvene in two
 
01:55:38.639 --> 01:55:41.189 align:start position:0%
now we're going to reconvene in two
weeks

01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
um so let's go to number
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
10 shall we allow Casino credit no yeah
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's my that's if we're going
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
to be yeah none of our gaming platforms
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
do we allow credit as a matter of policy
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
like our draft KS or ey Lottery even
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
though there's no l law against it it's
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
just bad policy so I would be right and
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
if we're going to call ourselves
 
01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
chatable gaming I don't think we want to
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
open this up I think you got a consensus
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
yeah pretty good I'm I'm just a chair
 
01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
just asking the questions okay so we uh
 
01:56:15.550 --> 01:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
so the recommendation is going to be no
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
credit be a
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the committee uh all
 
01:56:24.669 --> 01:56:24.679 align:start position:0%
all okay with that just say no if you're
 
01:56:24.679 --> 01:56:26.709 align:start position:0%
all okay with that just say no if you're
not

01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:26.719 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh should we allow 24-hour
 
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
operation um no I would say no too uh
 
01:56:38.189 --> 01:56:38.199 align:start position:0%
even even would do we open it to 3 o' we
 
01:56:38.199 --> 01:56:42.069 align:start position:0%
even even would do we open it to 3 o' we
just

01:56:42.069 --> 01:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
expanded and even at that do we know do
 
01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
we know how many are actually going out
 
01:56:50.669 --> 01:56:50.679 align:start position:0%
the four I I I don't I'm not aware of
 
01:56:53.950 --> 01:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
anybody going out the four don't think
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
I no I mean that point you're get
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
staffing issues right right and it's
 
01:57:02.109 --> 01:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
just it just it just doesn't make sense
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
to to be open that late um also I I
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
think that's under the name of
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming that we we keep it we
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
keep I think we just recommend that the
 
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
current the current hours of
 
01:57:16.109 --> 01:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
operation uh as in current statute is
 
01:57:19.149 --> 01:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
fine is that okay all right you'll see
 
01:57:20.910 --> 01:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
my words on this
 
01:57:24.669 --> 01:57:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
um the the one that's going to be a
 
01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
little a
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
little well oh yeah number six that's
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
another simple one thank you uh shall we
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
allow complimentary alcohol no NOP right
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
all right hey good we're all on the same
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
page right the one that's going to have
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
a little discussion let's started here
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
is the um should we should we have
 
01:57:51.599 --> 01:57:53.270 align:start position:0%
is the um should we should we have
pulled

01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
pulled
 
01:57:56.350 --> 01:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
tips so let's this and this will be the
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
last one of the of the day yeah so again
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
I I think that New Hampshire has a
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
pretty good tipping law I don't think we
 
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
should be changing it and messing with
 
01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
it especially for an industry specific
 
01:58:09.629 --> 01:58:09.639 align:start position:0%
change um and I think you know New
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a big believer you eat what
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
you kill if you work and you earn the
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
money you get to keep your money and not
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
have to give it to share it with
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
somebody else so yeah um so I'd be
 
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
inclined to not recommend pooling tips
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
even though I understand that there's a
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
whole area of uh you know the argument
 
01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
is that it's pooling tips reduces the
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
risk of corruption um and collusion with
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
the dealer um but I don't see that
 
01:58:33.790 --> 01:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire we have
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
security measures in place The Operators
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
are watching it um so I don't see this
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
as being um a good answer and never mind
 
01:58:44.030 --> 01:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that's a Workforce issue that
 
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
there are people from Massachusetts that
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
come up and from other states that come
 
01:58:48.069 --> 01:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
up and work in the Hampshire because we
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't fool our tips and they get the the
 
01:58:52.109 --> 01:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
amount of money they earn they actually
 
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
get the keep so so I would not be
 
01:58:56.350 --> 01:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
inclined in any way shape or form to
 
01:58:58.669 --> 01:58:58.679 align:start position:0%
touch this well there's there's no
 
01:59:00.589 --> 01:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
indication that we've got a problem
 
01:59:03.629 --> 01:59:03.639 align:start position:0%
right that we're trying to solve I guess
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
there another way to look at it um and
 
01:59:07.229 --> 01:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
it was the fellow from New Jersey who
 
01:59:10.270 --> 01:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
that was the the the uh he headed up the
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
casinos in Atlantic City or something
 
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
whatever he was he said what yeah that
 
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
could possibly be collusion between the
 
01:59:20.669 --> 01:59:20.679 align:start position:0%
dealer and the and the
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
player uh but
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know um you know we do I mean
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
all have cameras they're all being
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
watched uh and I don't know is it how
 
01:59:35.470 --> 01:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
easy is it to identify uh hanky panking
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
going on I mean would they we could
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
tell I mean as you can imagine the
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
operator is more interested in that
 
01:59:44.430 --> 01:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
almost than we are like because it's
 
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
their money too right and so yeah the
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
the levels of security and the cameras
 
01:59:50.069 --> 01:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
and the surveillance and the Dual the
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
segregation of Duties and the
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
all or internal controls like their
 
01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
internal controls processes is submitted
 
01:59:58.510 --> 01:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
to us for approval their surveillance is
 
02:00:01.069 --> 02:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
submitted to us for approval so it's
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's not impossible but it's very very
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
very hard and both of us have a vested
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
interest in making sure it doesn't
 
02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:08.679 align:start position:0%
happen so not saying it's never happened
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's just rare incidents obviously when
 
02:00:12.669 --> 02:00:12.679 align:start position:0%
people and cash are together there's
 
02:00:15.310 --> 02:00:15.320 align:start position:0%
always a problem but it's not as if it's
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
extraordinary in our industry right and
 
02:00:19.149 --> 02:00:19.159 align:start position:0%
the one thing Mr chair is again it's
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
already permissible to pull tips but New
 
02:00:24.189 --> 02:00:24.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire requires it be un unanimous
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
that all everybody agrees to do it if
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
one person steps out then that's no
 
02:00:30.069 --> 02:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
longer we can let we can let it's
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
already permissive right we don't we're
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
just question is whether we're going to
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
mandate it or not right yeah so and I
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
say no we don't mandate so right now the
 
02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
individual facilities can figure that
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
out the
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
employees okay you had a yeah thank you
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman we've seen a tipping Bill
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
come in maybe a dozen times since I've
 
02:00:50.430 --> 02:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
been in the legislature and every year
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
that people show up and say no I want to
 
02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
keep my own tips I earn my tips I want
 
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
to keep
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
them okay well I think I think we got an
 
02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:01.950 align:start position:0%
them okay well I think I think we got an
answer

02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
here um so I'll just say that um we are
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
not going to recommend uh pooling of
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
tips is that anybody disagree with that
 
02:01:17.149 --> 02:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
NOP okay so all right we are now at our
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
2hour limit um just to be respectful so
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
I'm going to
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
suggest another I'm going to try to
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
write what we've discussed today in
 
02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:29.750 align:start position:0%
write what we've discussed today in
short

02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
short
 
02:01:31.950 --> 02:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
little things that we could see the
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
words we can we can do a a formal vote
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
on each one of those as and eventually
 
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have the whole
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
report so we have a whole other list of
 
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
things to talk about um uh next meeting
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do that on SE two weeks from
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%

rebook them from that's fine that's fine
 
02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
