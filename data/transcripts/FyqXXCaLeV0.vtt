00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
very much good morning my name is uh

represent Sulton and samton in bellnap
 
00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
County um and I am introducing House
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 7
 
00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 align:start position:0%
which as uh chair cordelli pointed out
 
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh says that it's prohibiting the use of
 
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
facilities um although I would argue
 
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not prohibit or ban
 
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
anything um I think that's uh probably
 
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
some something that could have been
 
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
worded a little bit better and I'll
 
00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
explain why um but just to say that this
 
00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
um bill is modeled after the schools not
 
00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 align:start position:0%
shelters act introduced by Senator Cruz
 
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
in uh 2023 cille
 
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
2983 um and the origin of this bill and
 
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
the reason was that in 2024 Brooklyn uh
 
00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 align:start position:0%
New York students were forced into
 
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
remote learning uh for a couple days
 
00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
while they their school was turned into
 
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
an emergency shelter for a certain group
 
00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
of people um and I've given you some
 
00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 align:start position:0%
handouts there copies of uh I think the
 
00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
first one is parents fume after students
 
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
at James Madison High School forced to
 
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
learn remotely while schooled in a uh
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
schooled housing housed Asylum
 
00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
Seekers um so what what I have a problem
 
00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
with that is um especially on the heels
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
of the covid shutdown that we weathered
 
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire where schools were
 
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
shut down for almost a year um my school
 
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.189 align:start position:0%
shut down for almost a year um my school
in

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
winnisquam uh the students were forced
 
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
into remote remote learning for nearly a
 
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
year and my personal experience of that
 
00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
is that you know I had a school a child
 
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
in high school at the time and um you
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
know he was looking a little depressed
 
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
after a while being uh cut off from his
 
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
friends and his his school environment
 
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
um and I called the school counselor and
 
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
I said what can we do here you
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
know it's it's not going well and she
 
00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 align:start position:0%
said well come to mention it
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
I've getting a lot of calls about that
 
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
from parents and parents are calling and
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
complaining that their children are also
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
depressed are not thriving so um I think
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh enough has been said about how much
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
students and parents and Society in
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
general suffered enough during the uh
 
00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 align:start position:0%
shutdown uh during our covid crisis and
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
when it happened again in New York um it
 
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
was yeah it was amazing to me that it
 
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
would come back and haunt us again in
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
this way and another shutdown um and
 
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
naturally parents were fuming over it
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary it's disruptive it's it
 
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
was just it's the wrong way parents had
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
no idea how long this was really going
 
00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
to go on was it you know um obviously it
 
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be uh temporary and it
 
00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
was but was it temporary because there
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
was so much outcry
 
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
um get so this this is a this is of this
 
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
is where this is the origin of the bill
 
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
um there's another article in here from
 
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.710 align:start position:0%
um there's another article in here from
boston.com

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
boston.com
 
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
um bringing it back to our Boston area
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire area uh readers agree with
 
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
Governor hey's ban on migrant sleeping
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
at Logan Airport and this is another
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
reason I brought forth the bill was
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
because we heard about these uh families
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
and um how Logan Airport was turned into
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
a shelter I mean uh it's shocking that
 
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
it went on for so long all summer um and
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
people weren't happy about it as you can
 
00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 align:start position:0%
see from the newspaper article it's
 
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
inappropriate it's not really doing a
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
service for anyone not the people uh
 
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
using the airport and and and also not
 
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
for the uh people who are in the shelter
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
it's rather indignant I think there are
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
better ways and people need to do
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
planning um governments need to do plan
 
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 align:start position:0%
before they bring in these big
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
populations um so as I said uh this is
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
this bill so this the wording for this
 
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
bill I took almost word for word from
 
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
the schools not shelters act um I'm
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
going to go over a few other things here
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go into what the bill
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
does and does not do I also gave you in
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
your packet some um some other just
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
stats um I've highlighted on this page
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
is really fine print page the um Refugee
 
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
po population resettlement country by
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
origin from like the last 10 years and
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
I've highlighted the top three countries
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
of origin for last year as you can see
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
it it changes if you look at the chart
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
it will change the country of origin um
 
00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
year-over-year uh we had some record
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
numbers in uh
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
20 23 was uh one of the highest
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
years um and then it tapered
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
off um and and I'm just giving the
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
committee some of this background
 
00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
information so they can kind of see
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
what's going on in New Hampshire
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
particularly how things work uh it seems
 
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.230 align:start position:0%
particularly how things work uh it seems
sort

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
sort
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
of it's information that doesn't get out
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
there so um and then you have a letter
 
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2024 Refugee Support
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
Services formula allocations in a few go
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
to the second page I've highlighted New
 
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um with the amounts and
 
00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:40.039 align:start position:0%
also you'll see the proportion of
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
population arrived or served and that
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
this is purely just background
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
information I don't it's not necessarily
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
directly impacting bill um and it also
 
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:00.100 align:start position:0%
shows you um
 
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.230 align:start position:0%
shows you um
[Music]

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
now so it's just some some background
 
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
information but um so to the bill itself
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
um is a very simple Bill there are a
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
number of things it does and does not do
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
it does allow for short-term Emergency
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
Shelters by the general
 
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.829 align:start position:0%
Shelters by the general
population

00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
um it only applies to aliens as defined
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
by the US government which is not a US
 
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
citizen or National a
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
non-citizen it this bill does apply to
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
refugees people who have um achieved
 
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.910 align:start position:0%
refugees people who have um achieved
Refugee

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
Refugee
 
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
status it does not ban schools from
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
housing non-student populations so I
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
don't know why they use the word
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
prohibited because um so according to
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
this bill the
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
um one of the it sets a condition on
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
receipt of the money that you take from
 
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
um you agree to this condition that you
 
00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:06.839 align:start position:0%
will not house this specific population
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
and turn your schools your functioning
 
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
schools into shelters for the specified
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
aliens and there is a carve out for um
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
short-term uh emergency
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
um uh housing not to exceed 72 hours so
 
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
there are some Provisions for emergency
 
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
s Sheltering and also if you need to
 
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
turn your school into shelter for an
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
extented period of time because of some
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh weather event if it's open to the
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
entire Community then it's it's it's
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
fine this bill does not stop stop
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
schools from doing that um but what this
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
bill does is prevent schools um you
 
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
know uh insisting that uh schools um
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
turn their um it does not it does
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
prevent remote learning
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
and this is what uh the main focus of
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
is um and one last note about the fiscal
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
note at the end
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
um you will see there this bill does not
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
create positions does not require
 
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
funding of any kind um but they did put
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
a methodology at the end that is um
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
unusual I think it uh in worst case
 
00:11:28.829 --> 00:11:28.839 align:start position:0%
scenario the department estimates this
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
lot large loss of millions of dollars
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
now I checked with um former
 
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner John Stevens from the DHHS
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
about this he said that that in his
 
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
opinion was erroneous the way it's
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
worded that it should have said that the
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
the amount is
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
undeterminable um and instead of saying
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
you know that it may um so there is no
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
uh way to prove or disprove there's no U
 
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
reason to believe that any kind of
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
policy is going going to impact our uh
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
receiving of these federal
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
funds and I'd be happy to take some
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
questions if the committee CH thank you
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh questions from the
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent
 
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
food thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
question would this bill include a
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
school district building that was
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
currently vacant and not being used for
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
educational purposes but still owned by
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
the school
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
district thank you for your question
 
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative kuger that's a great
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
question in my uh estimation I don't
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
think so because it is not technically a
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
school and they it's not functioning as
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
a school it's simply a building owned by
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
a school Sim similar to um any other
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
property that a school might have a
 
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
field or something like that I guess
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
that's just another
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
item but it's not functioning as such
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
for the questions yes representative
 
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
Sally thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
my question I'm thinking about the
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
situation A couple of years ago where uh
 
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
the state of Texas without notifying the
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts put I think it
 
00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
was 200 people on a plane and sent them
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
to Martha's Vineyard so that they
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
arrived in the middle of a snowstorm
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
with no notice and no opportunity for
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
the state to plan in any way shape or
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
form for these people they did not know
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
were coming um and certainly couldn't
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
leave on the streets in the middle of a
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
snowstorm um and so you're part of your
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
premise is that people need to plan in
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
advance I'm curious when um other states
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
act in ways like that how do you
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
anticipate other states would be able to
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
plan if there is no notification and if
 
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
there is no process for
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your question
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
representative um it's not my position
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
to figure out where these groups will go
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
only to say that we shouldn't displace
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
one vulnerable population for another
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population our students being
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
a vulnerable
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
population and and and and risk their um
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
you know their well-being uh for another
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
group it other Solutions will have to be
 
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
made I I'm not at Liberty to uh design
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
the programs in that way but there are
 
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:24.519 align:start position:0%
other places there are schools that are
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
representa Cornell Thank you thank you
 
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question have you heard
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
about this happening in New Hampshire or
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
possibly happening in New Hampshire
 
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
or thank you for the question a great
 
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
question representative Cornell um no I
 
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
have not that's a good question and a
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
fair question and I have not um heard of
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
it happening I guess my hesitate my
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
focus on the bill was because we're so
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
close to Boston and Massachusetts and it
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
was happening to different degrees
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
there um that it sort of uh sent alarm
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
me in this page that you gave us it's
 
00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:13.959 align:start position:0%
highlighted are those numbers that came
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
to New
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the this one here yeah um yes
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
that is the this is strictly New
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at the top I know it's small
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
letters but says new Hamp New Hampshire
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
o r r eligible population resentment
 
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
that's the office of refugee
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
resettlement and I got this information
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
off of um I think some of it it came
 
00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.389 align:start position:0%
off of um I think some of it it came
from

00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:40.519 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh they have a a page about it and
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
they they run this program um so we do
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
have this program although it's you know
 
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes people aren't understanding
 
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
exactly where they are who these
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
populations are Etc but so that's why I
 
00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
kind of brought in some information just
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
just for background so that
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
um people can take a look at it follow
 
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
up Mr chair one more yes yep so I I
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
think these are the numbers that come we
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
have New Hampshire is an
 
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
immigration Reception Center where there
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
are places that are set up to receive
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
them so we are set up to receive that
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
and I think those groups know ahead of
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
time exactly how many people are coming
 
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
and where so these numbers are are
 
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
already provided for and I think they
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
already have schools houses
 
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
clothing everything already set up for
 
00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
them so this isn't a group that would
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
arrive in New Hampshire I I I I I think
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
you agree with that that it's not a
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
surprise that here they are and would
 
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
have to put them in a school these are
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
numbers that are planned for correct and
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
and my um thank you for the followup
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm just providing it simply as
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
background so in theory these
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
populations are provided for so I'm not
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
claiming that they're going to all of a
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
sudden disrupt the systems um only that
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
each school system is is kind of
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
different um and that there would be no
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
harm in putting this section of uh House
 
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 71 no no harm and putting it in our
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
statute because it doesn't really if
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
there's no harm done if if they um if it
 
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
just sits there and nobody has any plans
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
to turn our schools into shelters but if
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
if for some reason say Massachusetts had
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
a giant influx of immigrants or other
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
parts of New England
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
and um it's a possibility that it could
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
happen in sometime in the
 
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.950 align:start position:0%
happen in sometime in the
future

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question one of the questions
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
that I have is that in addition to the
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that you um that you read
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
before us um noting the 12 to18 million
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
per year are there any other uh programs
 
00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to the immigration
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
resettlement act um such as uh human
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
trafficking Assistance asy programs
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
refugees and humanitarian paroi programs
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
that could be at risk if something like
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
this were to go into
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
effect I mean in my opinion I I can't
 
00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
even imagine how this would put any kind
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
of program in Risk I have we heard of
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
any um Federal do we know of any um
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
times when the the federal government
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
has denied us funding because of
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh a remote uh you know just a obscure
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
piece of uh Statute in here that is
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
probably never going to be used I mean
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
do they do they deny us
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
funds there's no there's no basis for
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
that I couldn't find it I I tried to
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
look I called uh DHHS the commissioner
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
there there's no they have no know of it
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
ever happening or they said is you know
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
they put that in there just um it's very
 
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
Loosely worded like very liberally
 
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
worded and um they don't have any
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
evidence that the that no hard evidence
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
that they can supply that claim you know
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
that points to the fact that they we
 
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
would be denied any kind of funding for
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
any programs follow up uh thank you Mr
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
here um and and to that end I I guess
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
would there be any other uh undue
 
00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:29.799 align:start position:0%
burdens to political subdivisions law
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement other other things as a
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
result that you may not be aware of that
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
funding could be at risk as a
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
result I can't imagine um I I can't I
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
did some research I couldn't find any
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
reason why this this would uh encumber
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
anything um in fact they schools can
 
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
um can just ignore this their state
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
funding if they wish and and and do as
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
they please and turn shelters
 
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
I mean excuse me turn schools into
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
shelters as they wish uh this this bill
 
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
does not uh prohibit them from doing so
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
they can do it all on their own if they
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
they really want to this this doesn't
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
stop any school from doing that it only
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
ties the money if you receive the state
 
00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:18.919 align:start position:0%
money then you this is one of the
 
00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
conditions that's all so it doesn't
 
00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:23.430 align:start position:0%
conditions that's all so it doesn't
prohibit

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
it yes representative Bon uh thank you
 
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
question um there was a previous
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
question that mentioned um uh would this
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
apply to other buildings that the
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
schools or school districts currently
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
don't use but my question is what would
 
00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
it apply when schools are not in session
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
say when schools are on breaks vacation
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
summer um good question representative
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
um I I I would I would guess that it
 
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
does mean that that if if longer than 72
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
hours and it only it was only for alien
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
populations and they came in and said we
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
want to turn um we'd like to turn a
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
certain school for the summer and it's
 
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
going to become a um Refugee housing I
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
think I think this bill would prohibit
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
that um in this
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
way represent
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative for coming before us um
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
so given the testimony that you uh you
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
you've uh said right now we haven't had
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
an incident of this happening in New
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so would you consider this
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill to be more proactive instead of
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
reactive thank you representative
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
Freeman um yes I I mean I I consider it
 
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
yeah proactive yeah well it's it doesn't
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
really harm anything by being in statute
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
but it will give parents assurances and
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
PE of mind that this isn't going to
 
00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire so you know if
 
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
for instance the school was turned into
 
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.950 align:start position:0%
for instance the school was turned into
emergency

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.750 align:start position:0%
emergency
shelter

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
shelter
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
um for for one day or whatever that's a
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%
short term less than 72 hours they can
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
say well they have to be out of there
 
00:22:23.269 --> 00:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
you know within a certain time frame I
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
think what happened in New York was you
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
know they started to you know we had Co
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
and and the lockdowns and everything and
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
we got back to normal and then boom you
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
know we had you know in Brooklyn no
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to turn your schools into
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
something else and you're back to remote
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
learning and I think it just it was the
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
the last draw for parents um and uh
 
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
that's why they were so Furious and
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
understandably so because of the the
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
idea that we don't know how long it's
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
going to go on for you know um so at
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
least this puts some time frame around
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
it and some guard rails around all these
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
you know turning building municipal
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
buildings into other
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
things thank
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Hall thank you Mr
 
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
question uh you referenced the
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
methodology on the uh the worst case
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
scenario from the doe and the person you
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
checked with said it was it shouldn't
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
have been 12 to 18 million it should be
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
undeterminable so you I guess the
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
was he saying it could be a loss of
 
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue but just not sure how much was
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
that the problem he saw that shouldn't
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
have said 12 to 18
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
million thank you representative Hall um
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
question without knowing too much and
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
without like putting words into
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner Steven's mouth um I think
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
what how it I understood it
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
was they have no idea of knowing they're
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
simply saying there's some money there's
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
some funds this is a an
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
association uh at the at best this is
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
how I find it I tried to look and see if
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
there was ever a case where States lost
 
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
money um due to policies like State
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
policies I can't find anything I don't
 
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
see how they'd even know that we have
 
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
this law to be honest with you so um we
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
could pass this law that nobody would
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
know I mean what are they going to do
 
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
say oh we're not you can't partic speak
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
I mean so when I was looking around when
 
00:24:36.669 --> 00:24:36.679 align:start position:0%
you go to apply for this um Refugee
 
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
resettlement program through your state
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
each state has to come up with a plan so
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
they you know you're going to receive
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
some refugees and the the plan I
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a copy of the plan but
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
each state government has a a plan and
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
they have to you know say things where
 
00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to put them they have to
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
have a plan or they should have a plan
 
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
plan in place that's part of um the
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
agreement there's nothing that I found
 
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.430 align:start position:0%
agreement there's nothing that I found
that

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
says that you can't pass certain laws I
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
just couldn't find it it's just not in
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
there so I think it's really um
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
I I I I don't see any evidence for
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
saying that there's any reason
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
why the uh 12 to 18 million isn't in any
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy or even that it you know if you
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
look on our Refugee support Services
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
formula allocation it's not even close
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
to that amount it's like a million so I
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
don't know where they even got that
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
number I know that there's some HUD
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
funding in there too but
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
um I don't see how that that would
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
impact it at all a followup so
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner Ste Stevens didn't say that
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
there definitely wouldn't be a loss of
 
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
federal revenue correct he just we
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
didn't speak in absolutes like that
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
absolute uh representative Hall I
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
don't I mean
 
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't discuss it in that terms I
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
didn't try to to Pig you know to pigeon
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
hole it in that respect I was just
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
trying to understand where what the the
 
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.870 align:start position:0%
trying to understand where what the the
methodology

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
was and yeah okay thank
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I'm both intrigued and
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
concerned by the
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
verbiage in the methodology particularly
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
the second sentence where I see words
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
such as
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
suggests May
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
potentially since we're having this
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
discussion about the loss of federal
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
revenue in your conversations with Folks
 
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.430 align:start position:0%
revenue in your conversations with Folks
at

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
DHHS were you either offered or did you
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
request the substance uh of the of the
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
concern uh the basis of the concern that
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
resulted in words such as suggest May
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
and potentially and if not would you
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
suggest that it might be helpful for us
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
to drill done on this and ask for why
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
and what what what's the language here
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
that results in this opinion from
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
DHHS yes thank you representative Terry
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
I am very concerned
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
about how the word may Etc in here and
 
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
the implication that there is a a real
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
threat or or anything um there's nothing
 
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
that I got from when I was speaking with
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
d Jess that that no no uh implication
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
that that the commissioner was concerned
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
um that it was any kind of real threat
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
so I think I mean when I looked at the
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
Senate bill um the companion Senate bill
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
for this there wasn't any sort of
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
methodology similar methodology where
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
tying it there was nothing like that so
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
uh when I looked at that there's a bill
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
in um I think it's Tennessee the same
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
bill there's no sort of methodology at
 
00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:15.519 align:start position:0%
the end saying that this is a threat to
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
anything so I I just um this is very
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
concerning to me yes I think the the I
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
want to see evidence you know follow up
 
00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:26.519 align:start position:0%
so so just to button this
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
up there there's no statute and there's
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
no policy that was cited and provided to
 
00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:35.519 align:start position:0%
you for this
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
opinion correct thank you representative
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chairman good
 
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
morning I see it
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
um pardon pardon my you may have already
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
said this I missed it because I was I
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
don't have the bill actually I've been
 
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
trying to find one um but no let fine I
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
it wasn't over but that's okay that's
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
not the point my question is would this
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
past preclude or prevent school systems
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
summer would this bill prevent school
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
systems from being used sum yes to be
 
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
used for housing well for housing yeah
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
under the bill okay under the bill isn't
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
that what um representative Cornell was
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
asking was that similar what is that the
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
same question or similar so is is that
 
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
sort of like yes or no I mean I'm an old
 
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
guy um that's thank you that's that's um
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
so I would say yes I would say that if a
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
school decided to it doesn't really say
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
I mean that the point of the bill is not
 
00:29:43.509 --> 00:29:43.519 align:start position:0%
to put uh children into a short-term
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
learning scenario now I representative
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
Woodcock I I think just about every
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
school has got something going on in the
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
summer the summer programs and and
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
whatnot if they're
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
displacing summer program summer school
 
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
and in um camps and whatnot then yes I
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
would say that it it would uh prevent
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
that so possibly Mr chair yes follow
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
follow up yes thank you just for clarity
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
so the answer I just want to be clear so
 
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
the answer is under this bill if it was
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
passed the intent of the bill is not to
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
allow any of those facility to be used
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
even when they're uh absent of students
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
say in the summer there's no programs
 
00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:24.350 align:start position:0%
say in the summer there's no programs
going

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
on if this if schools were turned into
 
00:30:31.149 --> 00:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
Refugee shelters in the summer
 
00:30:31.159 --> 00:30:32.870 align:start position:0%
Refugee shelters in the summer
displacing

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
displacing
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
student um school programs yes I think
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
that would be a violation of this but
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's not displacing it's just empty for
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
the summer well it's not empty because
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
the school is never empty in the summer
 
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
I mean they have they have all kinds of
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
things going on in the summer okay thank
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
you yes representative
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
representative for taking another
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
question the word rep Refugee has come
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
up numerous times um representative do
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
you know the difference between a
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
refugee and an asylum
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
Seeker um thank you um I as best I can
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
tell representative
 
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
Freeman uh an asylum Seeker is seeking
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
Refugee status and a refugee has uh been
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
awarded if you will a refugee status in
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
the United States after applying after
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
court cases legal cases Etc is that your
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
understanding may I follow up yes so
 
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
technically you're saying that refugees
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
have been vetted by the United States
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
immigrations and Customs Service correct
 
00:31:44.909 --> 00:31:44.919 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that they are vetted
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
you I listened to a Boston radio station
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
um quite often and seems to me I've
 
00:31:59.710 --> 00:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
heard stories about uh problems in the
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh migrant shelters um in the Boston
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
area are you aware of any
 
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
difficulties um in the shelters in
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um thank you
 
00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli um Mr chair I I
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
have to admit I do not know how that is
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
but we do um we have had a number of um
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunate criminal cases crimes being
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
committed by uh Refugee Seekers or just
 
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
um people who had not received Refugee
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
status in the Boston area I think um not
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
I don't have that information but
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's been a number of news articles
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:32:43.269 --> 00:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately up in Vermont um a border
 
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
patrol agent was just killed a couple
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
days ago um by a u somebody who had
 
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
violated their visa um overstay their
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
visa and was fleeing up um I
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
think from this is my understanding was
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
fleeing up uh through Canada uh was St
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
stopped by a border patrol agent and
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately shot and killed them so
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
it's um there is crime and it is a real
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
thing um I have visited uh the border
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
patrol up in Vermont our Swanton sector
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
and um it's a serious business um we
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
don't know who these people are and
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
that's part of this other issue is that
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
um you have unknown populations and and
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
people running away from crimes in other
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
countries uh here and we just don't know
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
it's chaos questions representative s
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker just for a point of
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
clarification about the definition of an
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
asylum Seeker because that came up a
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
moment ago um an asylum Seeker
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
specifically is a person who left their
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
country and is seeking protection from
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
prosecution and serious human rights
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
violations um in that other country but
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
has not yet been legally recognized as a
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
refugee and is waiting to receive a
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
decision on their Asylum claim just to
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
be clear about what that definition
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you committee
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Jerry FW and
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Association
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
of school
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
administrators thank you for the
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak uh to you this
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
morning um several questions came to
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
mind and I would like to offer uh from a
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
practitioner standpoint having been a
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh in a community that
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
dealt with uh schools as Emergency
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
Shelters um just to share some of the
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
thought thoughts and questions that came
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
to mind as I read uh this particular
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
legislation with
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
um line six emergency shelter at housing
 
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
provided exclusively to specified aliens
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
the question that came to mind is who
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
determines on
 
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
site whether entry should be granted to
 
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
a community member or not is that the
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
school principle
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
is it the administrative assistant is it
 
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.190 align:start position:0%
is it the administrative assistant is it
the

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
superintendent in kir we had seven towns
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
do we have seven Town
 
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
clerks sitting in the lobby of the
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
school determining whether a person
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
could be admitted to the emergency
 
00:35:46.589 --> 00:35:46.599 align:start position:0%
shelter or not because of their status
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
as uh a resident or immigrant or
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
not um one of the other issues that that
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
uh arose as a question uh with 7 toour
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
limitation we did have an instance and
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
those of you who have been around for a
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
while may recall some major ice storms
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
and when I was at karge we actually had
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
to extend uh for over a week the
 
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our citizens to stay in
 
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
our schools because they didn't have
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
power in their own homes and so our
 
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
schools some of our schools um Nanda and
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
the Middle School uh had emergency
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
shelter status uh so that folks could
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
come have hot meals have showers sleep
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
there I remember the national guide
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
moving cots into the gymnasium at the
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
New London elementary school so the
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
folks could stay as long as they needed
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
to uh but we didn't have someone at the
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
at the schoolhouse door if you will
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
checking uh status uh the same with the
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
Middle School seven towns serving seven
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
towns um so those were uh a couple of
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
the questions that came up in terms of
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the practical application if you will
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
of this legislation at at the local
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
level a couple of other things came to
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
mind during uh Representatives testimony
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
um one question is does this apply to
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
public charter schools because um as you
 
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
learned in your orientation session the
 
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
other day presented by uh attorney
 
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
Fenton from the doe unless it says
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
Public Charter Schools they're not
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
included uh in any legislation so that's
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
one of the questions we have Charter
 
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
Schools all over the state does this
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
apply to public charter schools could um
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of serving as
 
00:37:40.589 --> 00:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
shelters um and uh the representative
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
spoke about remote learning and the
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
fears of uh schools uh displacing
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
students uh for long periods of time and
 
00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:51.079 align:start position:0%
subjecting them to remote learning I'd
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
like to remind this committee that
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
remote learning isn't a thing in this
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
state any longer we cannot put our kids
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
out for remote learning for any extended
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
periods of time that's a rule that we
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
have to adhere to so the the point that
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
that schools would close send their kids
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
home and put them on remote learning for
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
extended period of times can't happen in
 
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can't speak to other
 
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:14.839 align:start position:0%
states that do it but it cannot happen
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
in this state so uh those are the points
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to raise I'm happy to
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
address any questions from members of
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
the committee and thank you for the
 
00:38:26.349 --> 00:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity question from the committee
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock thank you Mr
 
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah good morning sir good to
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
see you again good morning U just a
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
quick question to followup um I'm still
 
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
having trouble with the this bill in
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
terms of the my understanding of the
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
facility is it your opinion if this bill
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
was passed that a school building
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
facility could not be used if empty
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
summer there's nothing that addresses
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
the summer so it would have to be the
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
assumption that it would apply at any
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
time of the year thank you thank you Mr
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
chair forther questions yes
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
representative Morris it's to my
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
understanding that wouldn't it be easy
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
to verify the status through like a
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
driver's license or a passport for
 
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
someone seeking let's say natural
 
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
disaster happens and you can verify
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
who's legal and who's not than thank you
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
for the question representative moris uh
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
I guess my question as a practitioner
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
whose job is that is that the School
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
principal's job is that uh the
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
custodian's job because the custodians
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
there at 8:00 at night when somebody
 
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
shows up or is that a town official job
 
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:27.990 align:start position:0%
shows up or is that a town official job
who

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility that's not spelled out
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
here and I think in terms of of applying
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
a law that those types of details need
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
to be addressed uh so there's no no

wolfboro and oopy in the beautiful Lakes
 
01:01:09.309 --> 01:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
Region and uh this is House Bill
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
440 uh it's related to
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
education educator or licensing and U
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
was it last week um maybe yes I lost
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
track of time a little bit but um we
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
heard from uh uh Diana Fenton from the
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Education about uh Ru
 
01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
making and the need to be specific in
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
terms of what we want to make rules
 
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
regarding when we put in
 
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
legislation and this um legislation is
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
the result of working with the
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
department and I believe there is a
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
represent attend representative here um
 
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
that can provide technical assistance um
 
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
in relation to this but um this uh amend
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
this U legislation uh specifies the
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
rules that should be required related to
 
01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
licensing and also very importantly uh
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
specifies that um CTE teachers can be
 
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
exempt uh from um some of these uh tests
 
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
uh especially if they have uh an
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
industry recognized credential we've
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
talked about in the past
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
um because we want U uh experienced uh
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
trades and teaching um in the CT centers
 
01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
so that's an important um uh piece of
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
this uh bill I
 
01:02:40.319 --> 01:02:42.269 align:start position:0%
this uh bill I
believe

01:02:42.269 --> 01:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
um and there are uh tests that can be
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
required um I know uh working on
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
literacy there are uh tests required um
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
for uh uh uh licensing and and sometimes
 
01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.269 align:start position:0%
for uh uh uh licensing and and sometimes
for

01:02:59.269 --> 01:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:03:03.309 --> 01:03:03.319 align:start position:0%
renewals um but I think that this uh
 
01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
meets the desire to have
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
specificity with regard to Ru making
 
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
with regard to uh educator
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
licensing thank
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%

you madam chairman um represent a quick
 
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
question um on the professional
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
education assessments page eight I mean
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
line eight in the back
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
um is this is this are they going to be
 
01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.950 align:start position:0%
um is this is this are they going to be
stipulated

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
stipulated
 
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
by um licensure or certificate are it
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
going to be stipulated somewhere it's
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
just part of the question the followup
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
is if it's a renewal and I've taken the
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
initial test on the one certification uh
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
test do I need when I renew my license
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
do I need to take the say they change
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
test assessments um I think possibly the
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
representative from the Department um
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%

states um likewise I think the
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative from the Department um
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%

they change they are they L ripped list
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
listed out somewhere and if they change
 
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
after say I take the test this year and
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
I renew so two part question and I renew
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
and the the test has changed they have
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
to take a test again yes thank you for
 
01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
the question great question um these are
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
for initial lure only not for Renewal so
 
01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:39.079 align:start position:0%
um if you're seeking a new endorsement
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
on your license then you would need to
 
01:05:41.789 --> 01:05:41.799 align:start position:0%
take a test which is the current
 
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
practice today but it would not be for
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
Renewal renewal purposes so when you
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
renew your license you would not need to
 
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
take that
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
test follow um see on this section A it
 
01:05:59.309 --> 01:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't say initial um so is that
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in the RSA I've
 
01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
missed it just say candidates for I
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't see initial or so if we go back to
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
line five and six such rules should
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
require all candidates seeking a New
 
01:06:13.079 --> 01:06:14.150 align:start position:0%
require all candidates seeking a New
Hampshire

01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
license so we we interpret that to mean
 
01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.870 align:start position:0%
license so we we interpret that to mean
first

01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
time doesn't say renewing it says
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
okay seeking seeking seeking means
 
01:06:29.599 --> 01:06:31.470 align:start position:0%
okay seeking seeking seeking means
initial

01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
initial
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you m CH
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
representative s thank you very much and
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question to
 
01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
repeat the question I I asked
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli Are there
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
specific exams that you've identified
 
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
and how does it relate to um recip
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
reciprocity yes great thank you good
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
question um yes we currently accept
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
exams from either ETS or Pearson um
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
those are the two primary uh exam
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
vendors for educator lure in our country
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
there are other vendors and we'll take
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
those we we'll analyze those and see if
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
they're comparable and we will accept
 
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
them uh many states have their own
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
testing Massachusetts for example have
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
the mtel exams some of you may be
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
familiar with those those are really
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
Pearson exams re rebadged for
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and we'll accept those as
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
well um as far as reciprocity goes um
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
these tests are portable so if someone
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
comes into our state state from
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and they've taken the mtel
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
exam and it's it's comparable to our
 
01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
y representative
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
Cornell here thank you for taking my
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
question so I would assume that they the
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
state board or whoever would never pick
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
a test for them to take that wouldn't be
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
accepted in other
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
states good question yes I I I don't
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
want to speak for the State Board in the
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
future however the way licensure around
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
the country Works um as I said there's
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
only a few very very few testing vendors
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
and it's all about comparability so
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
there could be a thirdparty test
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
developed as long as it meets those
 
01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.870 align:start position:0%
developed as long as it meets those
State

01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
State
 
01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
Standards then it's used and typically
 
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
state standards are based on National
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
standards so all the tests align but
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
again I couldn't speak specifically to
 
01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
the Future for the state board but it it
 
01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it hasn't been the practice
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
and I I may have missed this but why are
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
you asking for this now is it has there
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
been a problem or so the there's been a
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
concern other states um there there's
 
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
been a bit of whiplash in some states te
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
testing is imposed and then testing is
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
repealed then testing is imposed and it
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
creates a real burden for both
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
candidates uh the field as well as for
 
01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
our higher ed um teacher prep programs
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
because they of course testing is part
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
of their program and if there's a
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
testing requirement this year and then
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's repealed and then it's reinstated
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
you've got folks already in the process
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
so this adds a little more stability to
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
bbon thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um two questions
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
um one is there are alternative pass
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
certification that might lead to an
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
initial certification currently do all
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
paths to certification require taking a
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
test yes great question so um I'll
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
answer the second one first ultimately
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
to to to get a full license there will
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
be testing
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
involved um there are alternative
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
Pathways to go back to your first uh
 
01:09:47.709 --> 01:09:47.719 align:start position:0%
portion of the question there are
 
01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
alternative Pathways so that folks who
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
have different backgrounds who want to
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
enter the profession can enter the
 
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
profession they don't have to go to the
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
the through the standard you know four
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
four and 1 half year college program for
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
Education they can come from other
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
backgrounds but ultimately as is the
 
01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
case today they will be required to take
 
01:10:06.199 --> 01:10:07.870 align:start position:0%
case today they will be required to take
an

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
exam just to clarify they they do need
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
to take a test now regardless of the
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
pathway that is correct um and the
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
second question along with that is um do
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
they now have to provide a passing score
 
01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
and who determines what that passing
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
score might be yes great yes um they
 
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
right now for any candidate seeking
 
01:10:32.189 --> 01:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
initial lure they do need to provide a
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
passing score um we have some instances
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
where we will substitute a test so for
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
example there is a requirement for all
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
of our Educators to take a basic
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
academic skills test it tests eighth
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
grade knowledge of math writing and
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
reading and um we will Tak in place of
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
the standard what people have heard
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
prais core talked about at times that
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
that three-part test we will take SAT
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
scores at the 50th percentile or higher
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh in place of that test so if someone's
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
taken an SAT for example New Hampshire
 
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
our high school students take SATs we
 
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
will take that in place of B that basic
 
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
academic uh skills
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
test as far as who determines the
 
01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
passing score the State Board of
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
Education currently determines the cut
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
score and that is typically based again
 
01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
on a national cut score so again looking
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
around at reciprocity this way we don't
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
approve somebody here who goes two
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
states over and their score isn't good
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
enough there so we do today um typically
 
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
use the national cut score for these
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
tests but it is the state board that
 
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
determination representative
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh about the CTE
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
teachers uhu maybe examp on that final
 
01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
sentence um what is the case right now
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
for them for the CT that is that is
 
01:11:54.669 --> 01:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that is
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
currently the case Cas they are
 
01:11:57.790 --> 01:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
currently exempt from testing can
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
substitute an industry recognized
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
credential okay so this bold language is
 
01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
just adding it into the legislation okay
 
01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.189 align:start position:0%
just adding it into the legislation okay
thank

01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
NATO thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so on the uh
 
01:12:16.679 --> 01:12:18.990 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so on the uh
CTE

01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
CTE
 
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh for them are they basically working
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
under the umbrella of somebody who's
 
01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
already taken the tests uh cuz nobody
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
can give you really the really life
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
world uh say in a technician's world uh
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
who's been out in the field recently uh
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
so they're more than happy to help
 
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
youngsters fill their shoes and uh so
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
and obviously and uh would they be
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
working under like an umbrella of say
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
somebody who already took the tests and
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
everything yes so thank you for the
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
question so um CT teachers today can use
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
an industry recognized credential so for
 
01:13:03.149 --> 01:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
example maybe they have an ASC Master
 
01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
Mechanic credential they can submit that
 
01:13:08.629 --> 01:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
in place of standardized testing um and
 
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
then as far as once they're in the
 
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
classroom they typically have a mentor
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh or perhaps the CTE director um so
 
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
there are it depends on everybody does a
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
little differently right and but it that
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
does happen today so thank you very much
 
01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bon thank you um one
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
extra question um do some Educators uh
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's different certifications and
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
different licenses so some teachers have
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
multiple certifications do those each
 
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
certification require different tests I
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
mean is there one General test just to
 
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
get your licenser and then if you want
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
to be a a math specialist a reading
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
specialist are there additional tests
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
required and would they be subject to
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
the same uh language is the umbrella
 
01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
term for everyone that we hand a license
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
to uh within that there are four
 
01:14:00.239 --> 01:14:01.669 align:start position:0%
to uh within that there are four
categories

01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
categories
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
administrators classroom
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
teachers uh instructional Specialists
 
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
and uh educational Specialists right
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's right there in the in the statute
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
on lines uh six and seven so
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
um all
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
administrators and hopefully I don't
 
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
mess this up uh all administrators and
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
teachers are required to take that basic
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
academic skills test
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
and then so that's kind of the the
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
initial test if you will and then if
 
01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
they want to become a chemistry teacher
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
or a principle they're going to take
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
that specific test for that
 
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
endorsement and that's that's really a
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
Content Knowledge Test so if I want to
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
be a chemistry teacher I'm going to
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.149 --> 01:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
content okay representative Woodcock
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you m chair miss one more to
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
follow up on the industry recognize
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
credentialing is there a listing of that
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
I know you're just talking about the the
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
mechanic AC but there's a category below
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
that I mean what defines with an
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
acceptable industry recognized
 
01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
certificate yeah thank you for that
 
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
question so we work very closely with
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
the CT directors and the association on
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
um what what would be considered an
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
acceptable credential so for example if
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
someone's an electrician and they have a
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
license from our state as an electrician
 
01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
that's an industry recognized credential
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
um it is a very Broad odd term quite
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
honestly but folks come to the to the
 
01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
CTE world with all types of backgrounds
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
and all types of experiences and
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
credentials so we work when we have
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
questions we reach out to the CT
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
directors the folks that know best uh to
 
01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.149 align:start position:0%
directors the folks that know best uh to
determine

01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
determine
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
that follow matter here sure thank you
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
just so if if I was uh a young trades
 
01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
person uh 30 40 which is years ago and I
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh prepare
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
I couldn't for the exam prepare for
 
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
maybe getting it to education as a
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
vocational educator CTE educator
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
different sorry old term um and I look
 
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
online it doesn't tell me what I need to
 
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
prepare for right so no listing say we
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
don't list the exams because they change
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
okay right we don't not the exams excuse
 
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
me we don't list the the the industry
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
recognized credentials because those
 
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
change we do list the exams and you have
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
the option right saying trying to take
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
the AL as the recognized industry
 
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
credential it's wav okay thank you
 
01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:30.650 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:31.910 align:start position:0%
that's it
[Music]

01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
for coming in front of us um currently
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
just CT and I'm asking this question
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
because I think some people are asking
 
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
this question as well do CTE instructors
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
teach any core classes such as language
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
arts math science Etc thank you for the
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
question so um the the short answer is
 
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh they shouldn't be right we have
 
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that say they can't
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
what actually happens out in the schools
 
01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
we're not the police the certification
 
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
please but um we do have administrative
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
rules that that prevent that it follow
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
up thank you and thank you again for
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
answering this question so so basically
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is the CTE
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
instructors are there to teach a
 
01:17:18.159 --> 01:17:19.550 align:start position:0%
instructors are there to teach a
specific

01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
skill such as Automotive electrician
 
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
Plumbing hairdressing is that correct
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
correct that would be my understanding
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
much any other
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else looking to
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
testify on
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
my testimony sure so for the record my
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
name is Peter leechman I represent
 
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
Peterboro and
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
Sharon so I'm here to uh this morning Mr
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
chairman um to discuss bullying but not
 
01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
to to make any changes in existing law
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
but to give schools school boards
 
01:33:02.669 --> 01:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
another leg to at least get parents in
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
to discuss any uh remediation activities
 
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
regarding bullying so there's no change
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
in the existing statute and as you know
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of this
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
committee there's extensive laws in
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
place right now to deal with bullying
 
01:33:19.149 --> 01:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
but there's really nothing to prod the
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
parents or the Guardians in to discuss
 
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
consequences so it's pretty simple but I
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
have received um quite a bit of feedback
 
01:33:31.149 --> 01:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
uh from different organizations I
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
received uh a call from the U an
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
attorney representing the disability
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
Community where they have found bullying
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
to uh impact those members of our
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
community because and maybe um Miss
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg is here to discuss those
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
concerns but again my bill is just uh
 
01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
another if you will a tool in the
 
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
toolbox to uh
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
address bullying in our school systems
 
01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure I do have some uh written
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%

until she recently moved to Grandam or
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
is not still living in Peterboro but
 
01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
she's a superintendent in Grantham uh
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
she's provided some written testimony
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
she also wrote a very good OP ED on this
 
01:34:19.629 --> 01:34:19.639 align:start position:0%

01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
else that was the shortest uh one that
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%

01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%

about what what a bullying
 
01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
officer either is or would be in in
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
professional credential professional
 
01:35:48.239 --> 01:35:49.590 align:start position:0%
professional credential professional

01:35:51.870 --> 01:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
credential could this
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
be someone and and then it could it be
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
someone who's already on staff who holds
 
01:35:59.950 --> 01:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
the requisite credentials or would this
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
be determined by the school boards and
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
the trustees are you leaving this kind
 
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
of open-ended with respect to um
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
credentialing and and um and
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
training and then
 
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
um would would this building
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
officer would this person be um a a
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
volunteer or somebody who is paid you
 
01:36:25.229 --> 01:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
can just talk a little bit more about
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
that and help me understand the
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
background for this and what you have in
 
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
mind I would appreciate it sure thank
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
you for my question I must have included
 
01:36:38.109 --> 01:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
the bill in that package I handed out so
 
01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:40.360 align:start position:0%
I don't have it in front of me so I
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
should probably go back but as I
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
understand it and I'm not certainly an
 
01:36:46.750 --> 01:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
expert by any means uh schools already
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
have a bullying officer that's appointed
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
by the school board uh it's left up to
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
the school boards as I understand it's
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
often the school resource officer that
 
01:36:58.510 --> 01:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
is that person but it can be anything or
 
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
anybody and that's how I understand it
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
but this is just allowing again parental
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
involvement The Bullying officer is
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
somebody that's already part of this
 
01:37:09.629 --> 01:37:09.639 align:start position:0%
bullying statute that allows School
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
boards to appoint someone I believe at
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
their disc
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
discretion well so so with respect to
 
01:37:19.870 --> 01:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
credentialing and training and so forth
 
01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:23.719 align:start position:0%
or a program at a higher education uh
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
institution of higher education learning
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
uh that that would all be uh considered
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
and determined by each School
 
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
Board ifications would be in your
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
thinking here I believe that's how it's
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
handled now great thank you
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%

01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
single occurrence of an incident have to
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
file a chins petition potentially
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
escalating a school-based issue into a
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
Judicial issue
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
I believe in the fiscal note on the bill
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
if you look at it and I'm just thinking
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
back on memory there's already been like
 
01:39:34.030 --> 01:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
close to 600 have been filed Chin's
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
petitions already based on bullying so
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
happening uh
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
yes doesn't this bill go above its own
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
authority in creating parental classes
 
01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
for the accused
 
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
parents I don't think so I I really
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
believe that should be parental
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
involvement anyway I would hope that if
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
parents had a child that's been accused
 
01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
of bullying they would naturally come to
 
01:40:03.629 --> 01:40:03.639 align:start position:0%
the school and work with the school
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
authorities to discuss it um from what I
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
understand in talking with uh
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent Walker that sometimes
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's not always true and that at least
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
this would really put an encouraging
 
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
stick if you will to try to get the
 
01:40:18.669 --> 01:40:18.679 align:start position:0%
parents yet to discuss the issue with
 
01:40:18.679 --> 01:40:20.550 align:start position:0%
parents yet to discuss the issue with
the

01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
school go ahead thank you I I guess
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
guess the last question that I would
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
have is what would be the safeguards in
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
place to make sure that parents would
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
actually attend the classes versus just
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
not showing
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
up well again to be quite candid I would
 
01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
just hope that the the parents would
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
just show up that they don't need to be
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
encouraged to show up that they would
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
take the interest in their child to if
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
there's a accusation of bullying they
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
would you know come down to the school
 
01:40:51.149 --> 01:40:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
officials thank you sorry for so many no
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
not not a problem
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
um So currently there would be no
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
repercussions for parents who don't want
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
to where within this bill if they didn't
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
want to show up then they wouldn't be
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
technically required but it would more
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
be encouraged so there won't be any
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
legal uh
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
repercussions uh I don't believe so I
 
01:41:12.109 --> 01:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
don't believe they're going to be
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
arrested or anything it's more of an
 
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
encouragement to get them down there
 
01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
okay to the school
 
01:41:20.669 --> 01:41:20.679 align:start position:0%
sure yes representative Murray thank you
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:41:25.149 --> 01:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
question I are you aware that uh at
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
least pursuant to um
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
193f um five sub paragraph B it does say
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
that there are already educational
 
01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
programs required for pupils and parents
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
in preventing identifying and responding
 
01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
to uh incidents of
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
bullying I do have a copy of the
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
complete statute here and I guess I was
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
aware of that yes thank you sure yes
 
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
representative s thank you Mr chair and
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
01:41:56.669 --> 01:41:56.679 align:start position:0%
just am looking at this list of of
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
classes that are in I guess encouraged
 
01:42:02.189 --> 01:42:02.199 align:start position:0%
for parents to take the definition of
 
01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
bullying or the impact of bullying or
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
the root cause of bullying and I'm
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
trying to understand how attending one
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
of these classes will change the
 
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
behavior and so I wonder if you might be
 
01:42:17.550 --> 01:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
able to elaborate on
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
that well I think any uh the more
 
01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
information the better decisions so I
 
01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
would hope that someone's attending a
 
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
class that they may you know pick
 
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
something up that would help them to
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
address bullying issues okay and may ask
 
01:42:33.790 --> 01:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
pa um separately from this from work
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
that I did on a subcommittee over the
 
01:42:37.589 --> 01:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
summer what became clear is there's a
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
um uh there are times when things that
 
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
one might consider bullying other
 
01:42:46.350 --> 01:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
administrators or teachers might
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
consider just mean
 
01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
behavior um and I'm I'm curious how um
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
this bill would do anything to help
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
clarify or distinguish that or have any
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
impact on that I don't think it would
 
01:43:03.790 --> 01:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
but again um I would just be guessing
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't any forur the questions from
 
01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:10.669 align:start position:0%
wouldn't any forur the questions from
the

01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:10.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:13.390 --> 01:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
committee see none thank you very much
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative for being here today oh
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
not a problem thank you Mr
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
chairman uh next uh Karen Rosenberg from
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
Center good morning chairman cordelli
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
Karen Rosenberg I'm the policy director
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
at the disability rights Center which is
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire's protection and
 
01:43:43.229 --> 01:43:43.239 align:start position:0%
advocacy system for people with
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities and um although I think
 
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
that this bill was really well
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
intentioned I'm here to actually speak
 
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the bill our office um
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
does hear from parents whose children
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
have disabilities and have been
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
victimized by people who've been bullied
 
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
we also hear from parents and I've
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
represented kiddos who experience
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
disability especially disabilities
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
involving communication um autism
 
01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
spectrum disorder those kinds of speech
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
language issues who get accused of
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
bullying and are investigated for
 
01:44:18.589 --> 01:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
bullying and um maybe subject to school
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
discipline about this and what concerns
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
me is that
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
we we have a law in place already that
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
requires schools to have policies that
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
Define bullying that at Point usually
 
01:44:35.149 --> 01:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
it's a principal or their design to be
 
01:44:36.510 --> 01:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
the person who would investigate a
 
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
bullying incident there are resources
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
that are made available to schools
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
around bullying that are supposed to be
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
shared with parents and students um to
 
01:44:47.589 --> 01:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
set expectations there are
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
evidence-based interventions to deal
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
with school climate and school culture
 
01:44:54.669 --> 01:44:54.679 align:start position:0%
and I think that one thing that's really
 
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunate is that parents don't always
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
participate in these programs they don't
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
always they're not always engaged with
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
their students and with schools in the
 
01:45:08.589 --> 01:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
way that we would want them to be
 
01:45:11.229 --> 01:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
optimally and I can understand that it's
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
very frustrating for schools when they
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
are attempting to address bullying to
 
01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:19.719 align:start position:0%
take care of all the students because
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's what this Law requires they're
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to be taking care of the needs
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
of both the person who's the victim of
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
the bullying as well as the bully to
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
look at why they're bullying a lot of
 
01:45:31.589 --> 01:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
bullies have been bullied themselves and
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
um that's why they're doing this or
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't know any better and so
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
schools are making great efforts to do
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
this and I can understand how it would
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
be very frustrating on the part of if a
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
for a school provider to like try to get
 
01:45:47.589 --> 01:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
a parent involved and the parent doesn't
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
the parent doesn't support them the
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
parent doesn't come to the meetings
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
these things happen unfortunately though
 
01:45:56.189 --> 01:45:56.199 align:start position:0%
I think although this may be a problem I
 
01:45:58.270 --> 01:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill really addresses
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
it the kinds like a conference having a
 
01:46:03.229 --> 01:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
school conference inviting parents those
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
are all things that are permissible
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
under current law so if that is an
 
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate intervention our current law
 
01:46:12.669 --> 01:46:12.679 align:start position:0%
would enable the principal or their
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
design to have invite the parents
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're actually required to call both
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
the parents of the P the kiddo who's
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
accused of bullying as well as the kiddo
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
who's been victimized so they have I
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
think 48 hours to do that they can
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
Implement their policy they can have a
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
conference that they think that's
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate they can implement the
 
01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
school's disciplinary
 
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
code and I don't think that this is
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
going to change parents Behavior I think
 
01:46:42.270 --> 01:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
certain some parents no matter how much
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
a school district tries are just not
 
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
going to and and it would be lovely if
 
01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:49.719 align:start position:0%
we could um make sure that people could
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
get out of work and you know whenever
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
they need to to go to school meetings it
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
would be great if we could resource our
 
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
schools in such a way to provide more
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities for them to engage parents
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
and provide the the teachable moments
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
that our children need to learn about
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
the impact of bullying and how they can
 
01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
hurt their friends unintentionally and
 
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
make right by their friends it would be
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
really great if they had the resources
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
to do that um that's asking a lot of our
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
schools and they may not have the
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
resources to do that and what I'm
 
01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about is that by creating a
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
position of bullying officer which um
 
01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
might someone like a school resource
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
officer who's not trained in
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
evidence-based interventions or how to
 
01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
improve School climate or how to engage
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
parents is going to now be in a position
 
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
of sending more kids into our Juvenile
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
justice system and I don't think that
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to necess that that's not
 
01:47:43.589 --> 01:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
going to address the problem at hand
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's just going to take more kids and
 
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
potentially take them out of school when
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
they should be having their education
 
01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:53.510 align:start position:0%
they should be having their education
delivered

01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
because you know courts functioned
 
01:47:56.830 --> 01:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
during the school day and now they're
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
going to be in front of a judge and
 
01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
treated signed a juvenal parole
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
probation officer and and now they're
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
going to be further criminalized
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
marginalized um instead of being talked
 
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
taught about what it means to be part of
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
a school Community what the expectations
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
are and being folded into that so those
 
01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
are my concerns um and I I think that I
 
01:48:23.109 --> 01:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
don't deny that there's not that a
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
problem seems like there is a problem
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
with parent involvement but I don't
 
01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
think this is the solution so for those
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
reasons I would ask you to um not pass
 
01:48:35.589 --> 01:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm happy to answer any
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
questions you might have thank you
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:48:41.119 --> 01:48:42.790 align:start position:0%
questions from the
committee

01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:48:48.910 --> 01:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
um it it's uh pretty disturbing when you
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
see a lot of bullying cyber bullying I
 
01:48:56.669 --> 01:48:56.679 align:start position:0%
know somebody personally years ago lost
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
an 11-year-old child to suicide because
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
of that uh are there any studies or any
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
we doing any proactive in New Hampshire
 
01:49:07.390 --> 01:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
now that I'm unaware of well I know that
 
01:49:09.149 --> 01:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education receives
 
01:49:12.430 --> 01:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
bullying reports um it would be great if
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
they could do more to look have the
 
01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
resources to look deeper
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
into if there are like if there are
 
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
certain pockets of bullying or schools
 
01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
where it's not being resolved
 
01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.589 align:start position:0%
where it's not being resolved
appropriately

01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if they could do that
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware I mean I think someone
 
01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
here is there is someone here from the
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education who can speak to
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
what they do with the data but um in my
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge I I'm not aware of any
 
01:49:38.109 --> 01:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
extraordinary efforts to look into this
 
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
particular districts where there's a lot
 
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
of bullying and um yeah it's it's
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
terrible and it is really challenging
 
01:49:47.550 --> 01:49:47.560 align:start position:0%
schools are faced with challenges when
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
um we have Electronics available to our
 
01:49:53.070 --> 01:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
children um which allows them to
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully use hopefully use them for
 
01:49:56.109 --> 01:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
good communicate with us when we they
 
01:49:58.270 --> 01:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
need a ride home from soccer practice

changes to the child in need of services

pursuant to RS say 169 uh D that is
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
before you because I realize that it's
 
01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
quite a um dense and and lengthy um
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
statute that many of you may not be
 
01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with in this committee compared
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
to a juvenile justice committee or a
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
child and family law committee and I did
 
01:51:13.629 --> 01:51:13.639 align:start position:0%
want to speak briefly uh about the
 
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I think there's some U
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about that but if we
 
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
could just briefly explain to you the
 
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system which is under
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
DCF so the juvenile justice system
 
01:51:24.719 --> 01:51:26.270 align:start position:0%
DCF so the juvenile justice system
includes

01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
includes
 
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
169b which is delinquency and that is
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
for children under 18 who if they were
 
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
an adult and they committed a
 
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or a felony in the adult
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
World they can be held accountable in a
 
01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
delinquency petition proceeding in front
 
01:51:44.589 --> 01:51:44.599 align:start position:0%

who meets specific definitions of that
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
Chin's statue and as it stands now the
 
01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:03.719 align:start position:0%
chin statue is to summarize a child who
 
01:52:06.669 --> 01:52:06.679 align:start position:0%

this one's very lengthy so this one I
will

01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%

01:53:09.310 --> 01:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
is defined on page two lines 11 through
 
01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
13 of a child who has committed a
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
subsequent Act of bullying or cyber
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
bullying investigated by The Bullying
 
01:53:20.910 --> 01:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
officer and determined to be an act of
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
bullying by the perpetrator
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
against another
 
01:53:27.069 --> 01:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
pupil and because this is a brand new
 
01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
definition we are basically making an
 
01:53:31.629 --> 01:53:31.639 align:start position:0%
estimate a best estimate as to how many
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
children that would affect especially
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
because page one of the bill says that
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
the bullying officer shall file a
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
petition alleging that a child is in
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
services what we have now is many um
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
cases coming into juvenile
 
01:53:56.189 --> 01:53:56.199 align:start position:0%
Justice through schools and that was our
 
01:53:58.589 --> 01:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
estimate because there are already many
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
school-based chins in terms of repeated
 
01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:04.719 align:start position:0%
violations and of course the treny one
 
01:54:07.629 --> 01:54:07.639 align:start position:0%
so there is no definition yet in the
 
01:54:11.069 --> 01:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
chin statue that includes repeated act
 
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
or I'm sorry a subsequent Act of
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
bullying so we are making a best
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
estimate as to how many um new cases we
 
01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:22.199 align:start position:0%
would expect to see due to the addition
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
of this definition of
 
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
chins I will also note that the
 
01:54:30.990 --> 01:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
definition of chins as well as all of
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
169 D speaks to the before a petition
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
can be filed the
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
person who wants to bring that petition
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
first must bring in the Department of
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and have it
 
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
have what's called a voluntary Services
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
assessment done and Amy can speak more
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
to basically what that means what a
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
Chin's petition actually is in terms of
 
01:54:58.669 --> 01:54:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh again that is bringing a child into a
 
01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
courtroom and assigning them an attorney
 
01:55:04.069 --> 01:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
and it is a child in need of services
 
01:55:06.589 --> 01:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
not it's again I will Amy now speak to
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
that so when a case comes in to the I'm
 
01:55:13.709 --> 01:55:13.719 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry um when a case comes
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
into the Department of Health and Human
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
Services and it's assigned to a juvenile
 
01:55:18.669 --> 01:55:18.679 align:start position:0%
probation and parole officer for an
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
assessment to be completed to determine
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
the need for voluntary service Services
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
as part of the existing child in need of
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
services statute so that probation
 
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
officer would go to a residence of that
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
individual would engage with that child
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
and that parent either the parent or the
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
child can refuse to engage in that needs
 
01:55:41.229 --> 01:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
assessment which would then end that
 
01:55:44.350 --> 01:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
current assessment and allowing that
 
01:55:47.189 --> 01:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
District who's sending us that referral
 
01:55:49.149 --> 01:55:49.159 align:start position:0%
the ability to bring that child to court
 
01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
and file a petition in court proceedings
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
then that attorney would be assigned to
 
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
that individual the matter would then be
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
scheduled for judicial oversight and
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
then that child would be assigned a
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
juvenile probation and parole officer
 
01:56:05.709 --> 01:56:05.719 align:start position:0%
through the court system that child
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
could end up on probation as a result of
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
that matter and then be subject to
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
conditions of probation that they would
 
01:56:15.069 --> 01:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
then have to follow through which would
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
include ongoing regularly scheduled
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
review hearings and monitoring of those
 
01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:21.560 align:start position:0%

youngster do you want to speak to
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
voluntary Services consist sure so when
 
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
the juvenile probation and parole
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
officer goes and meets with the family
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
at their residence that there would be
 
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
an assessment completed utilizing the
 
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
child adolescent needs and strengths
 
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
tool If the child and the parent is
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
willing to engage in that assessment
 
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
that tool is a tool that identifies
 
01:58:35.629 --> 01:58:35.639 align:start position:0%
strengths and needs of that child and or
 
01:58:38.109 --> 01:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
family as a whole um and then there
 
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
would be recommendations made as to what
 
01:58:41.390 --> 01:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
service or intervention would be
 
01:58:44.430 --> 01:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
provided to that child and the parent
 
01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
those individuals have to agree
 
01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
voluntarily to participate in those
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
Services if they agree to participate in
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
those services then yes there could be
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
in um counseling that is offered there
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
could be a recommendation for that child
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
to participate at a local mental health
 
01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639 align:start position:0%
um Agency for that counseling there may
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
be a recommendation for a online course
 
01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
um depending on what is presented in the
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
actual assessment would drive the
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
outcome of the
 
01:59:16.990 --> 01:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations the Juvenile Justice in
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
general um I don't know if folks are
 
01:59:20.669 --> 01:59:20.679 align:start position:0%
aware has undergone significant
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
transformation over the past last five
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
years in really embracing Prevention
 
01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
Services and utilizing community-based
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
supports as a first line of intervention
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
for our children as the outcomes that
 
01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
they are um receiving would be more
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
improved by having earlier intervention
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
services which are not necessarily
 
01:59:44.109 --> 01:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
driven by Juvenile Justice but informed
 
01:59:47.790 --> 01:59:47.800 align:start position:0%
or utilized prior to involvement with
 
01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:50.310 align:start position:0%
or utilized prior to involvement with
us

01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I appreciate that when you
 
01:59:55.069 --> 01:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned Services prior you you didn't
 
01:59:57.550 --> 01:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
really get into that depth and just to
 
01:59:59.550 --> 01:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
be clear so if I understand that both
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
app parent and the young student child
 
02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
has to agree to participate and if they
 
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
don't then that terminates that
 
02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:08.679 align:start position:0%
assessment and then that move them into
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
the more the judicial area correct okay
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank chair can I just
 
02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
clarify one piece to make sure they were
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
all clear I'm sorry can I piece thank
 
02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
you um the the child and the current
 
02:00:26.189 --> 02:00:26.199 align:start position:0%
chin statute must have accessed some
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
form of community-based intervention
 
02:00:32.069 --> 02:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
before acceptance into DHHS for a
 
02:00:34.589 --> 02:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
Voluntary Assessment to be completed so
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
the current statute identifies wanting
 
02:00:39.310 --> 02:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
to have children and families access
 
02:00:41.790 --> 02:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
community- based supports that exist in
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
their communities as a first line of
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
intervention before involvement or
 
02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
referral to Juvenile Justice in any
 
02:00:54.430 --> 02:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair so it sounds like
 
02:00:59.589 --> 02:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
this bill would be jumping over that
 
02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
step and leaving out that communitybased
 
02:01:05.790 --> 02:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
intervention and going directly into a
 
02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:09.229 align:start position:0%
intervention and going directly into a
chin

02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
petition I do believe page two lines six
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
through eight uh briefly touched upon
 
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
what's required in the Chin's petition
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
and again the Chin's um statute was
 
02:01:24.669 --> 02:01:24.679 align:start position:0%
quite wordy so I will just highlight one
 
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
section that says that any petition
 
02:01:32.069 --> 02:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
filed by a school official must contain
 
02:01:34.669 --> 02:01:34.679 align:start position:0%
information that shows that this legally
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
liable school district has sought to
 
02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
resolve the express problem through
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
available educational approaches that
 
02:01:44.109 --> 02:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
the school district has sought to engage
 
02:01:46.510 --> 02:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
the parent or Guardian in solving the
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
problem but they have been unwilling or
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
unable to do so that the problem remains
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
and that Court intervention is
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
needed so it does take into account 169
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
D five Roman numeral five uh expressing
 
02:02:07.629 --> 02:02:07.639 align:start position:0%
that again before a child is brought
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
into court the school must exhaust all
 
02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:12.390 align:start position:0%
into court the school must exhaust all
communitybased

02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
communitybased
 
02:02:15.629 --> 02:02:15.639 align:start position:0%
uh problem solving of this again because
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
the last the last resort should be the
 
02:02:20.109 --> 02:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
school especially I mean should be Court
 
02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
especially in light of what Amy said all
 
02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
that we have done to prevent a child
 
02:02:28.350 --> 02:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
being brought into court thank you yes
 
02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
and I will note too that this this stat
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
this bill is silent on the age of the
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
child um the it is silent on the fact
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
that um chins and delinquency already
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
counts for the child who has committed
 
02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
what could be either a violation a
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or a felony so of course if
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
a bullying is uh including criminal
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
threatening harassment any acts of
 
02:03:02.030 --> 02:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
violence that's already um part of the
 
02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
System um with the um fiscal note it's
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh indicated that there have been
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
448 uh chins referrals made by school
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
districts um so those were made by um
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
one of the other uh subar paragraphs in
 
02:03:31.629 --> 02:03:31.639 align:start position:0%
D2 other than what we're adding here in
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
terms of bullying correct I don't have
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
the number in front of me but I would
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
assume that 95 95 are that first
 
02:03:44.589 --> 02:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
definition uh um acts of willful truancy
 
02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:49.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
yeah any further question
 
02:03:55.709 --> 02:03:55.719 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
time is there anyone else who would like
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:04:12.669 --> 02:04:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:12.679 --> 02:04:14.790 align:start position:0%
 
384

02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
384
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
hi Nancy Beerman New
 
02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
Boston um I was at a parent meeting last
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
night uh for sau19 and um I brought up
 
02:04:40.189 --> 02:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
this bill uh
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
because we are um also concerned about
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
some behaviors in the in the school
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
bullying was not one of them um because
 
02:04:52.149 --> 02:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
in our school in our school board has a
 
02:04:52.159 --> 02:04:53.229 align:start position:0%
in our school in our school board has a
policy

02:04:53.229 --> 02:04:53.239 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:04:57.790 --> 02:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
jic um it's 10 pages long and it
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
includes like every single step and I
 
02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
feel like our community and our school
 
02:05:07.229 --> 02:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
board is taking care of bullying and um
 
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
and has been taken care of um things
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
that are being presented here and I
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
again I'm concerned about students being
 
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
put into the juvenile detention system
 
02:05:24.549 --> 02:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
um because this bullying and and all the
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
aspects that are being put on the
 
02:05:28.549 --> 02:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
parents uh for this um our school
 
02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
district does a really good job and I
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
think that if you look at other school
 
02:05:34.669 --> 02:05:34.679 align:start position:0%
districts um because this policy
 
02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
definitely probably came from the New
 
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire School Board Association um
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
and they followed along with it and
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
added their own little twists because
 
02:05:43.549 --> 02:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
every Community does have their own
 
02:05:46.669 --> 02:05:46.679 align:start position:0%
needs that um I don't think that this is
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
needed um and so I would like you to
 
02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
vote against this um I don't like the
 
02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
fact that this policy also assumes that
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
the current school policy doesn't
 
02:05:57.390 --> 02:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
include parents our school policy has a
 
02:06:00.549 --> 02:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
lot of parent involvement in it and um
 
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:10.189 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:06:10.189 --> 02:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
question um uh I see we have people from
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and uh the
 
02:06:18.589 --> 02:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
school boards Association does anyone
 
02:06:22.109 --> 02:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
have any questions for U either of them
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
who might provide some
 
02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
answers um Miss Fenton could you talk a
 
02:06:30.510 --> 02:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
little bit about the reporting that is
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
department good morning for the record
 
02:06:52.229 --> 02:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
my name is Diana Fenton I'm an attorney
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education and I
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate the last speaker who left the
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
light on for me so I didn't have to come
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
up here and fumble the ball once again
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
um so the Department's role in bullying
 
02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
is is fairly limited uh perhaps narrowly
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
tailored is the better word for it so
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
the department does receive uh
 
02:07:15.149 --> 02:07:15.159 align:start position:0%
complaints about bullying instances of
 
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
bullying and what the department will do
 
02:07:19.950 --> 02:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
is reach out to the school district
 
02:07:23.470 --> 02:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
reach out to the family and the the
 
02:07:26.109 --> 02:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
general each case is unique obviously
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
but the general approach is that the
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
investigator for the department will
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
reach out to the school district and
 
02:07:34.189 --> 02:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
inquire if they are aware of the
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
instance in the report if they have a
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
policy that addresses bullying and if
 
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
law there can be instances again every
 
02:07:51.149 --> 02:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
every case is so fact dependent will
 
02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
commun unate with the family see if
 
02:07:55.589 --> 02:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
there's a resolution that can be reached
 
02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
um so sometimes the department can kind
 
02:07:59.470 --> 02:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
of act as an informal mediator in that
 
02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:00.950 align:start position:0%
of act as an informal mediator in that
sense

02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
sense
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
but legally the extent is to just
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
coordinate with the district make sure
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
they have a policy and that it complies
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
with the law and that the school has
 
02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
followed that
 
02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
policy every year in November the
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
department presents reports on on two
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
particular issues that catch attention
 
02:08:23.950 --> 02:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
the first is restraint and seclusion
 
02:08:25.069 --> 02:08:25.079 align:start position:0%
which we have discussed in this
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
committee during my presentation that's
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
governed by RSA 126 U that's the annual
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion report and at
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
the same time the department presents on
 
02:08:38.189 --> 02:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
bullying we compile those numbers from
 
02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
the school safety report which is an
 
02:08:42.549 --> 02:08:42.559 align:start position:0%
annual report that the schools fill out
 
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
and we present those
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
numbers again the Department's role is I
 
02:08:51.549 --> 02:08:51.559 align:start position:0%
use the term narrowly tailored uh we
 
02:08:53.790 --> 02:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
review those numbers we report out on
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
those numbers to the State Board we
 
02:08:57.790 --> 02:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
provide those reports on our website and
 
02:09:01.069 --> 02:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
to this legislative body the general
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
court in terms of our
 
02:09:06.430 --> 02:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
review you know for restraint and
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
seclusion and I recognize restraint and
 
02:09:10.549 --> 02:09:10.559 align:start position:0%
seclusion is not the issue right before
 
02:09:13.709 --> 02:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
this but those reports are kind of tied
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
together so forgive me if I if I go a
 
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
little bit astray for restraint and
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
seclusion if we see an abnormality in
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
the numbers if we see a very high number
 
02:09:26.549 --> 02:09:26.559 align:start position:0%
or a spike um we will reach out to the
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
school and inquire we do the same thing
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
for bullying but those numbers are
 
02:09:33.709 --> 02:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
different restraint and seclusion you
 
02:09:36.910 --> 02:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
can see if and I I will pick on my
 
02:09:39.149 --> 02:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
alamad kennet high school so forgive me
 
02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock um but if kennet
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
High School one year has five instances
 
02:09:46.350 --> 02:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
of restraint and seclusion and the next
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
year has 25 we're going to reach out to
 
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
kennet high school and inquire as to why
 
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
that is is there an issue with uh
 
02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
reporting is there an issue with the
 
02:09:58.589 --> 02:09:58.599 align:start position:0%
definitions and and the faculty not
 
02:10:00.549 --> 02:10:00.559 align:start position:0%
understanding what needs to be reported
 
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
it's different however when you look at
 
02:10:07.229 --> 02:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
bullying because bullying is between
 
02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
students right it's not about restraint
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
and seclusion and and faculty putting
 
02:10:14.189 --> 02:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
their hands on kids and so those numbers
 
02:10:18.270 --> 02:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
for bullying are always high we identify
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
what trends we see I believe this year I
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't have the the numbers right in
 
02:10:23.069 --> 02:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
front of me but I believe this year we
 
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
saw the Middle School numbers go
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
up and you know during the pandemic we
 
02:10:30.510 --> 02:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
noticed some Trends obviously the
 
02:10:32.189 --> 02:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
numbers went down and then in the years
 
02:10:34.149 --> 02:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
when the kids went back to school we
 
02:10:36.270 --> 02:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
noticed a huge increase in the numbers
 
02:10:37.549 --> 02:10:37.559 align:start position:0%
and that's really the role the
 
02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
department plays in terms of identifying
 
02:10:42.990 --> 02:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
those overarching Trends I'm happy to
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
take any questions and as always I
 
02:10:48.149 --> 02:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and I really admire
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
everyone who followed my advice and
 
02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
brought their book in I'm just glad I
 
02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
brought my own book and followed my own
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
advice any questions representative
 
02:10:59.950 --> 02:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you thank you attorney
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
senton I borrowed her book this morning
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
oh yeah well I didn't want to say
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
anything representative Woodcock but
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's always one I was working on it
 
02:11:08.669 --> 02:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
last night at home um I think I'm
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
misreading sure the statute um on
 
02:11:17.310 --> 02:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
looking at nine uh SE line nine of the
 
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
11 I probably miss you know I did take I
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
read your training twice I may I still
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't find this
 
02:11:31.549 --> 02:11:31.559 align:start position:0%
correctly is that the correct are they
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
citing the correct statute
 
02:11:38.910 --> 02:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
there is it 194 or 193f this says 19 I'm
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
looking at uh D line nine on the first
 
02:11:44.669 --> 02:11:44.679 align:start position:0%
spot 194 f11 they're talking about the
 
02:11:44.679 --> 02:11:45.950 align:start position:0%
spot 194 f11 they're talking about the
bullying

02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
bullying
 
02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
officer and I kept on coming up as the
 
02:11:50.189 --> 02:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
education trust fun I must have been
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
doing it wrong
 
02:11:55.870 --> 02:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
so the version I see in front of me and
 
02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
I have House Bill 384 pulled up
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
electronically I I see on page two line
 
02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
one I see a reference to 193 f11
 
02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
bullying officer yep I'm looking at line
 
02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:33.950 align:start position:0%
bullying officer yep I'm looking at line
nine

02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
on line nine I see in the are you on
 
02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:37.350 align:start position:0%
on line nine I see in the are you on
page

02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
two of the bill I'm on the back to the
 
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay so I agree with you the high the
 
02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
school bullying officer appointed
 
02:12:53.790 --> 02:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 94 f11 I think you're right
 
02:12:54.910 --> 02:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
I think that's a
 
02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
misprint right I think that's an inappro
 
02:13:00.430 --> 02:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
incorrect cross reference that will
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
bring you to the wrong statute that will
 
02:13:03.589 --> 02:13:03.599 align:start position:0%
bring you to the EFA
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
statute you should be in RSA 193 F1
 
02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
would be a new section
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
created I agree with you yes I think
 
02:13:16.990 --> 02:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
that is simply a scrier error follow up
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
Mr CH and I want to thank you because
 
02:13:21.229 --> 02:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
your training I saw that last night
 
02:13:23.310 --> 02:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
thank you well thank you very much I
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I'm glad you saw it
 
02:13:28.750 --> 02:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
because I didn't so thank you very much
 
02:13:31.069 --> 02:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
Cornell I The Bullying is reported
 
02:13:39.629 --> 02:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
through a program that whoever does the
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
discipline in the school fills out and
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
then sends to the so that's correct
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
changes could be like a new assist
 
02:13:47.790 --> 02:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
principle that has
 
02:13:50.669 --> 02:13:50.679 align:start position:0%
different definitions of what they want
 
02:13:54.629 --> 02:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
to call things or is it subject to human
 
02:13:57.189 --> 02:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
error or judgment it could be
 
02:13:59.470 --> 02:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell we see that more
 
02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
with the restraint and seclusion we see
 
02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
that more with restraint and seclusion
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
because as as we talked about in this
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
Committee in the training the
 
02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
definitions of restraint and seclusion
 
02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
are very complex right we saw that in
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
126 U where it says what it is and more
 
02:14:16.270 --> 02:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
importantly what it isn't however I
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
think that we can always account for
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
human error um discretion as to what
 
02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
gets reported what doesn't what gets
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
documented and what doesn't we don't see
 
02:14:29.709 --> 02:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
that as much with bullying as we see
 
02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
with restraint and seclusion I think
 
02:14:33.149 --> 02:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
those numbers speak louder to us in
 
02:14:35.229 --> 02:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
Restraint and seclusion than in bullying
 
02:14:39.549 --> 02:14:39.559 align:start position:0%
but I will say that I think um when you
 
02:14:42.910 --> 02:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
rely on people in a certain position you
 
02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
have that inherent discretion as part of
 
02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:48.870 align:start position:0%
have that inherent discretion as part of
it

02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes for the questions
 
02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you very much thank you
 
02:14:54.800 --> 02:15:00.109 align:start position:0%

02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
issue uh there was a mention of a policy
 
02:15:45.149 --> 02:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
in New Boston I believe um is that are
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
you familiar with that policy number and
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
is um that a standard policy from the
 
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
school board Association thank you for
 
02:15:54.589 --> 02:15:54.599 align:start position:0%
the question representative yes policy
 
02:15:57.149 --> 02:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
jic is pupil safety and violence
 
02:15:59.189 --> 02:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
prevention that is a required policy as
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
part of the bullying law here in New
 
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um it does lay out very
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
specifically what the New Hampshire
 
02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
definition is of bullying um it lays out
 
02:16:10.549 --> 02:16:10.559 align:start position:0%
the investigation procedures at the at
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
each district uh school districts and
 
02:16:15.950 --> 02:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
school boards need to agree on their who
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be their bullying
 
02:16:19.390 --> 02:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
investigator or the bullying officer I
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
believe was what it was called earlier
 
02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
um what the procedure is for
 
02:16:26.669 --> 02:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
investigation um there is always
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
conversation that happens regarding the
 
02:16:31.549 --> 02:16:31.559 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
um bullying incidences that are reported
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
versus founded incidences of bullying
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
this definition is very specific about
 
02:16:42.509 --> 02:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
what is considered a founded incident
 
02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
basically of bullying so often you might
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
hear community members or people talking
 
02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
about um lots of incidences of bullying
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
while that may be the casee in terms of
 
02:16:55.309 --> 02:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
what is happening not every case that is
 
02:16:57.790 --> 02:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
reported becomes a founded invest
 
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
founded case of bullying that does not
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
mean that it is not mean I think to some
 
02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
of the other Representatives comments
 
02:17:05.549 --> 02:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
earlier does not mean that people are
 
02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
not fighting or kids are not being um
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
hurtful to each other and that there are
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
some in some you know uh interventions
 
02:17:15.230 --> 02:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
that need to take place to address those
 
02:17:18.549 --> 02:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
kinds of issues but not every um
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
incident that is reported becomes a
 
02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
founded in incident of bullying based on
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
the definition uh there are also other
 
02:17:27.070 --> 02:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
sample policies and forms that go along
 
02:17:30.270 --> 02:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
with jik in terms of reporting forms
 
02:17:32.429 --> 02:17:32.439 align:start position:0%
bullying report forms and Schoolboard
 
02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:34.599 align:start position:0%
notification of bullying
 
02:17:36.910 --> 02:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
reports thank you you're
 
02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
welcome yes representative Terry thank
 
02:17:41.709 --> 02:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
you uh now that we know that um that
 
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
these sample policies um exist can you
 
02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
give us some sort of an idea of how
 
02:17:51.070 --> 02:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
widespread their usage is um across R
 
02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
the state by school districts not
 
02:17:55.629 --> 02:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily all of them in total but
 
02:17:58.750 --> 02:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
that there is some degree of um
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
utilization by school districts thank
 
02:18:02.509 --> 02:18:02.519 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative
 
02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:05.599 align:start position:0%
Terry jic is a required policy by the
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
state for every single School Board must
 
02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
adopt a policy around bullying
 
02:18:12.030 --> 02:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
investigation and Reporting um this is a
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
sample policy as I believe the speaker
 
02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
prior spoke to District we offer sample
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
policies to member districts to adjust
 
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
to some extent based on the culture and
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
their Community needs um however there
 
02:18:26.509 --> 02:18:26.519 align:start position:0%
are parts of those policies that are
 
02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
required by law that must be addressed
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
somehow within that policy so every
 
02:18:32.190 --> 02:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
Local District School Board should have
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
this policy thank you you're
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Woodcock thank
 
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
you chairman K good morning good to see
 
02:18:42.669 --> 02:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
you again back um as regards the term
 
02:18:45.549 --> 02:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
bullying officer is that is that a new
 
02:18:47.629 --> 02:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
term I mean I haven't seen bowling
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
officer I've seen Desy principal Desy I
 
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
mean a variety of pieces is that defin
 
02:18:55.230 --> 02:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere or is I just missed that as
 
02:18:56.870 --> 02:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
well uh thank you for the question
 
02:18:58.349 --> 02:18:58.359 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock I would have to
 
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
go back specifically in C and
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
193f um if it's designated in terms of
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
what the title is but each school
 
02:19:07.389 --> 02:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
district and School Board does need to
 
02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
identify who is going to complete the
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
bullying investigations in most cases I
 
02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
believe it calls out the principal
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
specifically however I'm sure they could
 
02:19:17.429 --> 02:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
designate somebody else um to somebody
 
02:19:19.950 --> 02:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
else's previous comment regarding
 
02:19:21.549 --> 02:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's the school resource
 
02:19:23.429 --> 02:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
officer there are also I would just
 
02:19:25.950 --> 02:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
caution people to assuming excuse me
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
that the school resource officer if
 
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
there is one would also be the bullying
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
investigative officer because there are
 
02:19:34.509 --> 02:19:34.519 align:start position:0%
times where School District procedures
 
02:19:36.270 --> 02:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
need to be separate from police
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
procedures um and I would just want to
 
02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
be cautious that um that may not be the
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
case for bullying officers where the
 
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
school resource officer may or may not
 
02:19:47.710 --> 02:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
be able to fill that role based on those
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
differences yeah thank you so um
 
02:19:52.590 --> 02:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I probably should have
 
02:19:54.990 --> 02:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
asked attorney Fenton when she's up here
 
02:19:57.309 --> 02:19:57.319 align:start position:0%
but I I can't I hav that ter bullying
 
02:19:59.670 --> 02:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
officer just is jumping on my C I've
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
never seen it uh in terms of rsas or in
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
school administration as granted as you
 
02:20:07.870 --> 02:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
said someone's designated and it may
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
happen to be a police officer by Happ
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
stance but that's so I was just trying
 
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
what it say refer it to that I didn't
 
02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
know we creating a
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
new category or somewhere else to refer
 
02:20:19.469 --> 02:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
to thank you for the question
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative when I do a quick word
 
02:20:24.190 --> 02:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
search for the word officer under 193f
 
02:20:26.429 --> 02:20:26.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear at all in that section
 
02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you this twice did I'm
 
02:20:32.070 --> 02:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
right yes representative
 
02:20:34.270 --> 02:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
litfield thank you and thank you for
 
02:20:36.870 --> 02:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question in light of the fact
 
02:20:40.349 --> 02:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
that you've mentioned that jic exists it
 
02:20:41.950 --> 02:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
is a
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
requirement do you have a stance on
 
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not you feel this bill is
 
02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
necessary does the New Hampshire School
 
02:20:50.030 --> 02:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
Board Association support or oppose this
 
02:20:51.429 --> 02:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
bill thank you for the question
 
02:20:52.830 --> 02:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lichfield it's nice to
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
see you um we're not taking a position
 
02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
on this bill as it's currently written
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
um I think that you know from a
 
02:21:03.870 --> 02:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
procedural standpoint involving families
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
and having family engagement Whenever
 
02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
there is any kind of incident um where
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
students are at risk on either side it's
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
important to have parental involvement
 
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
um however there is a lot of crossover
 
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
as I think you've heard from previous
 
02:21:19.630 --> 02:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
speakers with uh other departments other
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
um systems that would need to be
 
02:21:23.790 --> 02:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
involved in this I think having um
 
02:21:25.630 --> 02:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
parents at the table as I'm sure you've
 
02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
heard me say many many times is very
 
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
important in these conversations whether
 
02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
or not uh this bill
 
02:21:34.349 --> 02:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
accomplishes um it's real getting rid of
 
02:21:36.429 --> 02:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
bullying in our schools I'm not I don't
 
02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
that no other questions thank you very
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
02:21:50.590 --> 02:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
you so I guess that will'll close uh the
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
02:21:57.790 --> 02:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
384 and um we will uh break for for

Litchfield welcome thank you Mr
 
03:34:39.469 --> 03:34:39.479 align:start position:0%
chair good afternoon so this is
 
03:34:42.150 --> 03:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
regarding House Bill 446 again my name
 
03:34:44.189 --> 03:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
is uh representative Melissa witfield
 
03:34:47.070 --> 03:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
out of Brentwood Fremont Danville this
 
03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
bill came about simply because of a
 
03:34:52.469 --> 03:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
constituent request right now as it
 
03:34:55.389 --> 03:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
stands in the public schools if any
 
03:34:57.910 --> 03:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys are given out to
 
03:35:00.429 --> 03:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
the students the parents are to be given
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
10 days notice and it is to be an op in
 
03:35:08.189 --> 03:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
the parent had simply requested that
 
03:35:10.510 --> 03:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
instead of a link being attached to the
 
03:35:12.910 --> 03:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
email that the actual survey be attached
 
03:35:14.950 --> 03:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
to the email so that the parents can
 
03:35:17.389 --> 03:35:17.399 align:start position:0%
view the survey on the
 
03:35:19.950 --> 03:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
spot I am also planning to offer an
 
03:35:22.070 --> 03:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
amendment today that I'm going to pass
 
03:35:32.110 --> 03:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
now I'm just going to wait a moment
 
03:36:11.870 --> 03:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:32.469 --> 03:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:32.479 --> 03:36:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
ser

03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:49.349 --> 03:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
okay so the dis of the amendment is just
 
03:36:51.550 --> 03:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
simply the fact that right now there is
 
03:36:55.070 --> 03:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
an exemption for the CDC youth risk
 
03:36:57.590 --> 03:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
assessment survey right now the parents
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
do not have to opt in it is an opt out I
 
03:37:03.630 --> 03:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
am requesting through this amendment
 
03:37:06.030 --> 03:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
that the committee agree that we go
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
ahead and we change that to an optin
 
03:37:11.790 --> 03:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot out there about how
 
03:37:13.550 --> 03:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
maybe some of the kiddos aren't taking
 
03:37:16.269 --> 03:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
this survey quite as serious as maybe
 
03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
they should be and I know there's a lot
 
03:37:20.670 --> 03:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
of important data that we get from it so
 
03:37:23.670 --> 03:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
the goal is right now to um provide the
 
03:37:25.670 --> 03:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
same the parents with the same courtesy
 
03:37:27.389 --> 03:37:27.399 align:start position:0%
that they're receiving with all other
 
03:37:30.229 --> 03:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys that is the 10-day
 
03:37:33.229 --> 03:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
notice um along with the optin but this
 
03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
also would give the parents a chance to
 
03:37:36.670 --> 03:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
maybe sit down with their kiddos and say
 
03:37:39.030 --> 03:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
hey this is a very important survey we'd
 
03:37:41.070 --> 03:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
really like you to take it
 
03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:51.790 --> 03:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative Woodcock um to
 
03:37:55.389 --> 03:37:55.399 align:start position:0%
the chair yes I may I'm looking at the
 
03:37:59.590 --> 03:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
amendment um thank you by the way and it
 
03:38:03.110 --> 03:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
significantly Alters the initial bill
 
03:38:05.630 --> 03:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned that if we take this I
 
03:38:06.630 --> 03:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
don't know how you're going to rule on
 
03:38:11.429 --> 03:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
it re we take this now in in process
 
03:38:13.110 --> 03:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
then there seems to me there' be a lot
 
03:38:15.189 --> 03:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
of folks and organizations that may want
 
03:38:16.710 --> 03:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
to dialogue about that particular
 
03:38:18.150 --> 03:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment we won't have an opportunity
 
03:38:20.590 --> 03:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
if we hear it to today yeah we're not
 
03:38:23.030 --> 03:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
going to um execute
 
03:38:27.389 --> 03:38:27.399 align:start position:0%
today um but if yeah but for example uh
 
03:38:29.429 --> 03:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
representative if if I if I belong to
 
03:38:31.469 --> 03:38:31.479 align:start position:0%
group X and I want to speak on this I
 
03:38:33.630 --> 03:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
won't have a chance to do that is then
 
03:38:35.389 --> 03:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
this is a major function of this bill
 
03:38:37.830 --> 03:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
right just so just I'm put out there
 
03:38:39.830 --> 03:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
that a concern I have already okay thank
 
03:38:41.550 --> 03:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
you yeah I'm G try and take that into
 
03:38:49.309 --> 03:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:53.469 --> 03:38:53.479 align:start position:0%
um uh there was um the original Bill had
 
03:38:57.189 --> 03:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
another change in it too do you want to
 
03:39:01.830 --> 03:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
that are we um discussing the attachment
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
of the surveys to the
 
03:39:11.309 --> 03:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
email uh yes yes right okay so right so
 
03:39:13.830 --> 03:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
what would happen now is if this bill
 
03:39:16.750 --> 03:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
were to pass any non-academic surveys
 
03:39:18.429 --> 03:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
the parents will be notified 10 days
 
03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
ahead of time but they won't be just
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
given a link to the survey there'll be
 
03:39:24.110 --> 03:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
an attachment on the email of that
 
03:39:24.120 --> 03:39:29.630 align:start position:0%
an attachment on the email of that
particular

03:39:29.630 --> 03:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:32.550 --> 03:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
survey represent Murray thank you Mr
 
03:39:33.750 --> 03:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:39:37.630 --> 03:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
question so in looking at lines 13 uh
 
03:39:40.269 --> 03:39:40.279 align:start position:0%
through 15 which is in addition to the
 
03:39:43.630 --> 03:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
non-academic survey I'm curious to know
 
03:39:46.670 --> 03:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
if that the term academic survey could
 
03:39:50.229 --> 03:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
potentially include things like um lunch
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
request forms or any other type of of
 
03:39:57.510 --> 03:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
information that is necessary for the
 
03:39:59.830 --> 03:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
daily functioning of Learners to sort of
 
03:40:03.110 --> 03:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
participate in their daily goings on in
 
03:40:07.309 --> 03:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
the school Community uh so that's that's
 
03:40:09.510 --> 03:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
the first question I had about whether
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
or not that could be interpreted in that
 
03:40:11.520 --> 03:40:16.870 align:start position:0%
or not that could be interpreted in that
way

03:40:16.870 --> 03:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:20.590 --> 03:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
so with this amendment in HB
 
03:40:25.070 --> 03:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
446 um all I have done is taken out
 
03:40:29.750 --> 03:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 13 I believe 13 14 15
 
03:40:31.469 --> 03:40:31.479 align:start position:0%
are already in existence at this point
 
03:40:31.479 --> 03:40:37.309 align:start position:0%
are already in existence at this point
in

03:40:37.309 --> 03:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:39.910 --> 03:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
time oh I'm sorry I I understand I'm
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
sorry I understand what you're saying
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I read the amendment and not
 
03:40:46.510 --> 03:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
the bill yeah I was referring to the
 
03:40:53.670 --> 03:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:59.870 --> 03:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.670 --> 03:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you Mr chair and then um
 
03:41:05.910 --> 03:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
again uh continuing on in lines 13
 
03:41:09.590 --> 03:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
through 15 my question um is to whether
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
or not it says that you are requiring
 
03:41:13.469 --> 03:41:13.479 align:start position:0%
communication through email and quote
 
03:41:16.590 --> 03:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
any other means of delivery the district
 
03:41:19.389 --> 03:41:19.399 align:start position:0%
deems appropriate so in the way I'm
 
03:41:21.150 --> 03:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
looking at this is it possible that the
 
03:41:23.630 --> 03:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
district could say that's all we're
 
03:41:26.990 --> 03:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
doing is email and that's that's it
 
03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:37.149 --> 03:41:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:40.349 --> 03:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
OSS um we we had discussed this earlier
 
03:41:42.189 --> 03:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
and I I think the feeling had been
 
03:41:44.790 --> 03:41:44.800 align:start position:0%

Goffstown so I'm a co-sponsor on this
 
03:42:34.429 --> 03:42:34.439 align:start position:0%
bill and one of the things that I try to
 
03:42:36.189 --> 03:42:36.199 align:start position:0%
always reinforce when we talk about
 
03:42:38.070 --> 03:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
notification to parents especially from
 
03:42:40.389 --> 03:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
public schools is that these children
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
unless they are ward of the state are
 
03:42:45.309 --> 03:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
the sole um responsibility of their
 
03:42:46.630 --> 03:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
parents their parents are the only
 
03:42:50.710 --> 03:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
people who can recommend Health Care get
 
03:42:53.229 --> 03:42:53.239 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health get counseling assist
 
03:42:55.389 --> 03:42:55.399 align:start position:0%
the children medically speaking and
 
03:42:58.110 --> 03:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
legally speaking if there is an issue
 
03:42:59.670 --> 03:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
and if the parents aren't notified of
 
03:43:01.670 --> 03:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys or any other places
 
03:43:04.149 --> 03:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
where issues may be identified and the
 
03:43:05.710 --> 03:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
parents don't have the means to take
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
care of their CH their children
 
03:43:09.710 --> 03:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately there's no set of
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the government the
 
03:43:15.309 --> 03:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
government's teachers public education
 
03:43:16.630 --> 03:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
who who do work for the government
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
should be the sole Proprietors of a
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
piece of information that is not shared
 
03:43:22.269 --> 03:43:22.279 align:start position:0%
with the parents unless there is an
 
03:43:24.349 --> 03:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
imminent risk in which case the law
 
03:43:25.630 --> 03:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement should be notified
 
03:43:27.990 --> 03:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
immediately so I'm coming to this from a
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
perspective of transparency for the
 
03:43:32.269 --> 03:43:32.279 align:start position:0%
parents as care providers for the
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
children the public education system is
 
03:43:37.269 --> 03:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
a great system but everything that they
 
03:43:39.269 --> 03:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
do that's non-academic should be clearly
 
03:43:42.750 --> 03:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
transparent to the uh parents as is
 
03:43:44.670 --> 03:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
everything that they do that's academic
 
03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
time thank you uh questions for the
 
03:43:54.670 --> 03:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative Morris
 
03:43:56.790 --> 03:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair it seems to me that
 
03:43:58.110 --> 03:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh like questionnaires about school
 
03:44:00.990 --> 03:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
lunches would be exempt for this um
 
03:44:05.670 --> 03:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
particular bill as to the designated def
 
03:44:07.269 --> 03:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
the definition to designate elicit
 
03:44:08.710 --> 03:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
information about the student social
 
03:44:12.429 --> 03:44:12.439 align:start position:0%

03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
use or anything along those lines is
 
03:44:17.040 --> 03:44:19.030 align:start position:0%
use or anything along those lines is
that

03:44:19.030 --> 03:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:22.510 --> 03:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
correct I would not first of all I mean
 
03:44:23.870 --> 03:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
respectfully I've never seen a
 
03:44:25.910 --> 03:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
questionnaire about what you would want
 
03:44:28.550 --> 03:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
for lunch um but that would occur to me
 
03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh to be a day-to-day operational thing
 
03:44:33.389 --> 03:44:33.399 align:start position:0%
in support of Education now with that
 
03:44:35.790 --> 03:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
said I don't see a reason why a a family
 
03:44:37.950 --> 03:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get shared a survey on what's
 
03:44:39.429 --> 03:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
available for lunch if they have
 
03:44:41.070 --> 03:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
specific dietary needs that the school
 
03:44:43.590 --> 03:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
may not know about or may know about so
 
03:44:45.389 --> 03:44:45.399 align:start position:0%
I don't see a reason why we would hide
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
that from the parents but I also don't
 
03:44:49.149 --> 03:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
see that as an outlined relevance within
 
03:44:53.149 --> 03:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:53.159 --> 03:44:55.070 align:start position:0%
 
sir

03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
sir
 
03:44:58.670 --> 03:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
no uh I just point out that the uh the
 
03:45:02.990 --> 03:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh list of um information on line
 
03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
1718 um are taken uh from a federal
 
03:45:10.389 --> 03:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
statute for federally funded uh
 
03:45:14.269 --> 03:45:14.279 align:start position:0%
surveys um that was put in with the
 
03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
original bill uh back a number of years
 
03:45:19.950 --> 03:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
ago represent of sik thank you very much
 
03:45:22.550 --> 03:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
03:45:23.550 --> 03:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to think about these
 
03:45:25.830 --> 03:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
surveys in the context of my child who's
 
03:45:28.590 --> 03:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
been in a High School Sociology class
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
and obviously with sociology they're
 
03:45:32.469 --> 03:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
studying different things so the
 
03:45:35.590 --> 03:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
students in the class designed surveys
 
03:45:38.469 --> 03:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
that they used with their peers within
 
03:45:41.469 --> 03:45:41.479 align:start position:0%
the building that were not academic
 
03:45:43.030 --> 03:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
right it might be about movies it might
 
03:45:45.429 --> 03:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
be about um whether the the roller
 
03:45:47.710 --> 03:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
skating I don't know you know but
 
03:45:49.110 --> 03:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
specifically because they were learning
 
03:45:51.990 --> 03:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
the skill of completing sociology
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
experiments so these would be
 
03:45:56.870 --> 03:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys for the purposes of
 
03:45:58.950 --> 03:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
the students improving their in the
 
03:46:01.070 --> 03:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
class generating things with those
 
03:46:03.670 --> 03:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
surveys by by the statute need to be
 
03:46:07.510 --> 03:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
sent to parents 10 days ahead of
 
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
time uh thank you representative by my
 
03:46:12.429 --> 03:46:12.439 align:start position:0%
understanding as long as that was part
 
03:46:14.189 --> 03:46:14.199 align:start position:0%
of the course curriculum which was
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
outlined and given to the parents in
 
03:46:18.870 --> 03:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
advance that would be within the scope
 
03:46:22.229 --> 03:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
of the class follow up please yes thank
 
03:46:24.910 --> 03:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
you so it but the surveys were given
 
03:46:26.510 --> 03:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
beyond the students in the class right
 
03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
they were given to students like you
 
03:46:30.389 --> 03:46:30.399 align:start position:0%
know through other programs through the
 
03:46:32.469 --> 03:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
advisory or through lunch during the
 
03:46:34.510 --> 03:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
Lunch Period or whatever so that they
 
03:46:36.309 --> 03:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
could elicit information from their
 
03:46:37.950 --> 03:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
peers for the purposes of compil
 
03:46:40.950 --> 03:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
learning how to compile data right like
 
03:46:42.990 --> 03:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
just as an example maybe they surveyed
 
03:46:44.429 --> 03:46:44.439 align:start position:0%
to determine whether Mor kids like
 
03:46:46.790 --> 03:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
pepperoni eat pizza versus make your own
 
03:46:49.269 --> 03:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
sandwiches you know so that's a
 
03:46:51.630 --> 03:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
non-academic survey being used for an
 
03:46:53.469 --> 03:46:53.479 align:start position:0%
academic purpose so I'm just curious how
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
that would fit with this
 
03:46:58.389 --> 03:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
bill representative my advice at that
 
03:46:59.870 --> 03:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
point in time would be to air on the
 
03:47:01.469 --> 03:47:01.479 align:start position:0%
side of caution and make those available
 
03:47:03.710 --> 03:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
to the parents um because they're being
 
03:47:05.710 --> 03:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
used out of the scope of that specific
 
03:47:07.309 --> 03:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
classroom and among the general
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
population that's how I would interpret
 
03:47:11.950 --> 03:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
that um just from a prudent standpoint
 
03:47:14.269 --> 03:47:14.279 align:start position:0%
to prevent any questioning of morality
 
03:47:44.630 --> 03:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:44.640 --> 03:47:46.309 align:start position:0%
 
what

03:47:46.309 --> 03:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
what

Boston
 
03:47:54.910 --> 03:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
um my major concern with this bill and
 
03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
I'm all for restricting more um is that
 
03:48:01.630 --> 03:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
we need to have some more teeth to it um
 
03:48:01.640 --> 03:48:02.590 align:start position:0%
we need to have some more teeth to it um
in

03:48:02.590 --> 03:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:48:06.630 --> 03:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
2024 um school year um I'm sorry 23 24
 
03:48:09.670 --> 03:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
school year I requested on right to know
 
03:48:12.429 --> 03:48:12.439 align:start position:0%
asking gtown high school for all surveys
 
03:48:14.030 --> 03:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
and questionnaires that they had given
 
03:48:15.229 --> 03:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
to students at the beginning of the
 
03:48:15.239 --> 03:48:16.429 align:start position:0%
to students at the beginning of the
school

03:48:16.429 --> 03:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:48:20.950 --> 03:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
year um that was 113 Page Long document
 
03:48:23.269 --> 03:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
that I received
 
03:48:25.670 --> 03:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
so the school district knew about this
 
03:48:27.630 --> 03:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
law they knew about the rules they were
 
03:48:29.670 --> 03:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
still allowing the teachers to do
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
this um questions ranged from asking
 
03:48:35.950 --> 03:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
about knowledge of a subject or skills
 
03:48:38.429 --> 03:48:38.439 align:start position:0%
for that subject matter some of them
 
03:48:41.149 --> 03:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
asked about their favorite foods colors
 
03:48:43.229 --> 03:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
don't know sure about why that had to be
 
03:48:45.550 --> 03:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
there um but then it also moved on to
 
03:48:47.790 --> 03:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
more personal questions asking students
 
03:48:50.149 --> 03:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
what their pronouns were and what
 
03:48:53.389 --> 03:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
gender um there are also links to online
 
03:48:56.229 --> 03:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
surveys that we don't know if that third
 
03:48:57.910 --> 03:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
party was collecting that data and using
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
it somewhere
 
03:49:02.269 --> 03:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
else um there was also questions asking
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
which was your preferred parent to be
 
03:49:06.670 --> 03:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
contacted well both parents if there's
 
03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
two parents everyone should be contacted
 
03:49:13.229 --> 03:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
if there's an issue um in one uh paper
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
that was from a uh teacher they asked
 
03:49:17.429 --> 03:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
for the students cell phone number not
 
03:49:20.269 --> 03:49:20.279 align:start position:0%
the parents the student one I reported
 
03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
this to the Department of Education um
 
03:49:24.630 --> 03:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
the school district um was told that
 
03:49:25.950 --> 03:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
they needed to do more training with
 
03:49:29.670 --> 03:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
their teachers and that was
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
it so there's no incentive for this
 
03:49:36.630 --> 03:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
school district to do or not do it um so
 
03:49:39.349 --> 03:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
this year 2425 school year I again asked
 
03:49:41.630 --> 03:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
for a right to know uh my school
 
03:49:43.950 --> 03:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
district is um not happy when I do right
 
03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
to know requests because the immediate
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
response I get from them is we'll get
 
03:49:50.670 --> 03:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
back to you in 90 days with your answers
 
03:49:54.110 --> 03:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
um when I uh submitted a email to the
 
03:49:56.189 --> 03:49:56.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Education about this
 
03:49:59.030 --> 03:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
refusal of supplying the information
 
03:50:02.149 --> 03:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
until 90 days um all of a sudden four
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
weeks later I got the information again
 
03:50:06.110 --> 03:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
this year whereas last year it took two
 
03:50:10.189 --> 03:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
weeks um this year there was 24 pages of
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
information um so teachers are still
 
03:50:15.269 --> 03:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
giving questionnaires and surveys um
 
03:50:17.149 --> 03:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
thankfully the personal information was
 
03:50:20.429 --> 03:50:20.439 align:start position:0%
not uh provided and not asked for this
 
03:50:24.510 --> 03:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
time so I was happy to see that um there
 
03:50:27.670 --> 03:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
was no information about social behavior
 
03:50:30.149 --> 03:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
Family Life religion politics or sexual
 
03:50:33.269 --> 03:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
orientation or drug use or anything else
 
03:50:36.389 --> 03:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
so they are with the training following
 
03:50:37.710 --> 03:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
but again they're still giving the
 
03:50:39.830 --> 03:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
surveys so I think there needs to be
 
03:50:41.189 --> 03:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
more clarification to the school
 
03:50:43.630 --> 03:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
districts more training and um there
 
03:50:45.870 --> 03:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be something more I think if we
 
03:50:48.070 --> 03:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
sat there and we did write to know
 
03:50:50.309 --> 03:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
request to a bunch of school districts
 
03:50:52.189 --> 03:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to get surveys uh and
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
questionaires from teachers that um
 
03:50:56.429 --> 03:50:56.439 align:start position:0%
asked questions that they shouldn't
 
03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
because the parents don't know that
 
03:50:59.830 --> 03:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to be asking and if
 
03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
you're wondering why I asked our school
 
03:51:04.110 --> 03:51:04.120 align:start position:0%
district about this and started it was
 
03:51:05.790 --> 03:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
one parent came up to me she was new to
 
03:51:08.110 --> 03:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
the district and her son came home and
 
03:51:10.269 --> 03:51:10.279 align:start position:0%
he's like Mom why is this teacher asking
 
03:51:13.389 --> 03:51:13.399 align:start position:0%
me about my gender and so she rep
 
03:51:15.830 --> 03:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
replied to me she contacted me and I did
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
it because she didn't feel like she
 
03:51:20.510 --> 03:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
could as a new parent to the district um
 
03:51:22.950 --> 03:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately most of the teachers
 
03:51:24.349 --> 03:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
that were doing the questions about
 
03:51:25.990 --> 03:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
gender and sexual orientation and
 
03:51:29.110 --> 03:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
pronouns were the science teachers so
 
03:51:30.710 --> 03:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
again there needs to be more bite to
 
03:51:32.269 --> 03:51:32.279 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
03:51:36.429 --> 03:51:36.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions representative B
 
03:51:40.870 --> 03:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
Bon oh I never get questions you do now
 
03:51:42.510 --> 03:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
oh my
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
goodness uh thank you for taking um my
 
03:51:47.830 --> 03:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
question uh you mentioned that you
 
03:51:50.229 --> 03:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
submitted the right to no request to get
 
03:51:53.630 --> 03:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
the um the academic nonacademic surveys
 
03:51:58.149 --> 03:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
so um the the law says that the parental
 
03:52:01.189 --> 03:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
permission is required so are those
 
03:52:03.389 --> 03:52:03.399 align:start position:0%
surveys that you're mentioning um did
 
03:52:05.149 --> 03:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
they say that the parents weren't did
 
03:52:07.269 --> 03:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
not give permission for those there were
 
03:52:10.429 --> 03:52:10.439 align:start position:0%
no parental permission given or asked
 
03:52:13.950 --> 03:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
for on any of it never that's that's
 
03:52:18.269 --> 03:52:18.279 align:start position:0%
what the School District said told you
 
03:52:18.279 --> 03:52:20.469 align:start position:0%
what the School District said told you
yep

03:52:20.469 --> 03:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:52:22.590 --> 03:52:22.600 align:start position:0%
yep any further
 
03:52:26.389 --> 03:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
questions now you can go
 
03:52:40.710 --> 03:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:44.630 --> 03:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
Banfield good afternoon
 
03:52:46.349 --> 03:52:46.359 align:start position:0%
um my name is Amry Banfield I'm a
 
03:52:48.269 --> 03:52:48.279 align:start position:0%
parental rights Advocate focused on
 
03:52:50.630 --> 03:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
excellence and education I've been
 
03:52:52.910 --> 03:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
advocating on behalf of parents in
 
03:52:55.910 --> 03:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
education for about 15 years and I come
 
03:52:58.630 --> 03:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
here in support of HB
 
03:53:03.710 --> 03:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
446 so I've been here longer than this
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
actual law so I can go back in history
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
and answer any questions in terms of how
 
03:53:12.429 --> 03:53:12.439 align:start position:0%
the law came to be I was very involved
 
03:53:15.429 --> 03:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
with the original Law and this is why we
 
03:53:19.349 --> 03:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
need to expand the law and include the
 
03:53:23.189 --> 03:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
yrbs um years ago students were asked
 
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
highly sensitive and personal questions
 
03:53:28.309 --> 03:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
on surveys distributed for by for-profit
 
03:53:30.389 --> 03:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
vendors so for-profit vendors were
 
03:53:31.910 --> 03:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
gathering all this information because a
 
03:53:36.349 --> 03:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
lot of these surveys uh come from online
 
03:53:38.710 --> 03:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
vendors parents were shocked to learned
 
03:53:40.229 --> 03:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
that their children had been asked
 
03:53:42.429 --> 03:53:42.439 align:start position:0%
controversial questions on sex drugs and
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
alcohol usage in one case a father in
 
03:53:47.269 --> 03:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
Bedford said that because of these
 
03:53:49.990 --> 03:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
surveys his child learned how to get get
 
03:53:51.389 --> 03:53:51.399 align:start position:0%
high sniffing
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
glue unfortunately the yrbs only
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
requires notification appearance by
 
03:53:55.920 --> 03:53:57.149 align:start position:0%
requires notification appearance by
school

03:53:57.149 --> 03:53:57.159 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:53:59.229 --> 03:53:59.239 align:start position:0%
Personnel since the questions on the
 
03:54:01.269 --> 03:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
survey are sensitive in nature parents
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
should be required to
 
03:54:06.790 --> 03:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
consent the power school breach should
 
03:54:10.389 --> 03:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
everybody this information is very
 
03:54:18.110 --> 03:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to attackers hackers
 
03:54:20.550 --> 03:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
notification does not go far enough and
 
03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
a notification may never be make it to a
 
03:54:25.229 --> 03:54:25.239 align:start position:0%
parent that's the problem sometimes it
 
03:54:27.990 --> 03:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
does sometimes it doesn't the first
 
03:54:30.189 --> 03:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
questions on the yrbs surveys are
 
03:54:33.070 --> 03:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
tracking questions children have written
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
their names on them and they use their
 
03:54:37.349 --> 03:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
unique pupil identifier number on them
 
03:54:39.550 --> 03:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
because they think it's a test and so
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:46.990 --> 03:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
in Bedford years ago too a parent
 
03:54:49.030 --> 03:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
demanded that his child survey be
 
03:54:51.070 --> 03:54:51.080 align:start position:0%
destroyed after he found out his child
 
03:54:53.189 --> 03:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
took it without his knowledge the
 
03:54:54.870 --> 03:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
administrator did confirm that they
 
03:54:57.950 --> 03:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
destroyed the survey if it was Anonymous
 
03:54:59.990 --> 03:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
how' they manag to find
 
03:55:02.550 --> 03:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
it there should never be a license to
 
03:55:04.750 --> 03:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
void privacy rights to collect personal
 
03:55:07.710 --> 03:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
data for researchers or other government
 
03:55:09.910 --> 03:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats public administrators and
 
03:55:11.950 --> 03:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats will always be asking for
 
03:55:13.990 --> 03:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
things that will make their job easier
 
03:55:16.990 --> 03:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
or for a little more money essentially
 
03:55:19.830 --> 03:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
opt out makes the Assumption an entire
 
03:55:22.550 --> 03:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
family voluntarily gives up their
 
03:55:25.870 --> 03:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
privacy rights this is
 
03:55:28.189 --> 03:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
wrong the private sector when it comes
 
03:55:30.790 --> 03:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
to survey the industry standards and
 
03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
best management practice require optin
 
03:55:35.870 --> 03:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
that is the standard there is no
 
03:55:37.830 --> 03:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
justification to carve out a special
 
03:55:39.870 --> 03:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
standard for schools when it comes to
 
03:55:42.830 --> 03:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
the issue of parental rights and
 
03:55:45.590 --> 03:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
privacy so in addition because this has
 
03:55:48.269 --> 03:55:48.279 align:start position:0%
come before legislators in the
 
03:55:52.149 --> 03:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
past um I have additional testimony now
 
03:55:55.550 --> 03:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
this will identify prior
 
03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
legislation um but for instance this one
 
03:55:58.880 --> 03:55:59.830 align:start position:0%
legislation um but for instance this one
is

03:55:59.830 --> 03:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:56:03.070 --> 03:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
from a medical professional Doctor Who's
 
03:56:06.870 --> 03:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
talking about why the the uh the survey
 
03:56:09.349 --> 03:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
the ybs does not have IRB approval which
 
03:56:11.309 --> 03:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
it should to make it a
 
03:56:14.309 --> 03:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
valid survey so this does not have IRB
 
03:56:17.229 --> 03:56:17.239 align:start position:0%
approval that's all explained in here uh
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's not valid kids take it for a
 
03:56:22.670 --> 03:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
joke they they just randomly answer
 
03:56:25.229 --> 03:56:25.239 align:start position:0%
questions it's not in a in a um
 
03:56:27.990 --> 03:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
scientific setting so he explains all of
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
that in here in
 
03:56:34.030 --> 03:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
addition uh in the past John Depetro who
 
03:56:37.070 --> 03:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
is a well he's pretty much a privacy
 
03:56:39.149 --> 03:56:39.159 align:start position:0%
data privacy expert anybody who knows
 
03:56:40.950 --> 03:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
him knows that this is what he deals
 
03:56:42.830 --> 03:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
with this data privacy and he explains
 
03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
in here how this data is not
 
03:56:48.910 --> 03:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
protected and that this is also subject
 
03:56:53.269 --> 03:56:53.279 align:start position:0%
to um a breach or a hack or something so
 
03:56:55.229 --> 03:56:55.239 align:start position:0%
again they are giving the surveys the
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
surveys will be given they're not taking
 
03:57:00.269 --> 03:57:00.279 align:start position:0%
it away with this all we're simply
 
03:57:02.750 --> 03:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
asking for all they're simply asking for
 
03:57:05.469 --> 03:57:05.479 align:start position:0%
is to make sure the parents consent so
 
03:57:08.229 --> 03:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
when a student is asked about their
 
03:57:11.670 --> 03:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
sexual activity or their drug usage or
 
03:57:14.229 --> 03:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
if they've um you for instance uh a
 
03:57:16.469 --> 03:57:16.479 align:start position:0%
question three if they've attempted
 
03:57:18.990 --> 03:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
suicide and sometimes people feel so
 
03:57:20.750 --> 03:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
depressed about the future that they may
 
03:57:22.590 --> 03:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
consider attempting suicide for
 
03:57:24.790 --> 03:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
themselves or killing themselves this
 
03:57:27.389 --> 03:57:27.399 align:start position:0%
may not be what a parent wants their
 
03:57:31.469 --> 03:57:31.479 align:start position:0%
child to answer and so if I knew that
 
03:57:34.590 --> 03:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
notification was getting to every parent
 
03:57:36.030 --> 03:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
and that every parent had the
 
03:57:38.269 --> 03:57:38.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look through this and
 
03:57:39.750 --> 03:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that this is okay for their
 
03:57:42.189 --> 03:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
child because to be honest with you a
 
03:57:43.630 --> 03:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
lot of parents are going to be okay with
 
03:57:45.870 --> 03:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
this they're going to be fine with
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
taking this survey but there are going
 
03:57:50.670 --> 03:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
to be some that are not and it is time
 
03:57:53.550 --> 03:57:53.560 align:start position:0%
to respect those parents instead of
 
03:57:56.110 --> 03:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
putting up a strong arm and driving them
 
03:57:58.389 --> 03:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
out of the public schools so I think
 
03:58:00.870 --> 03:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's another factor to consider so I'm
 
03:58:02.469 --> 03:58:02.479 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions if you
 
03:58:02.479 --> 03:58:03.349 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions if you
have

03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:58:06.309 --> 03:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
any thank you
 
03:58:08.790 --> 03:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
questions see oh yes representative
 
03:58:11.910 --> 03:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
Freeman yeah thank you and thank you Mrs
 
03:58:14.149 --> 03:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
Banfield for coming in front of us um
 
03:58:17.149 --> 03:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
since I I do know that you've been um on
 
03:58:20.910 --> 03:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
the leading front of this for many years
 
03:58:22.830 --> 03:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense of what happens to
 
03:58:24.630 --> 03:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
that data after the surveys the
 
03:58:26.710 --> 03:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
non-academic surveys are
 
03:58:29.309 --> 03:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
completed uh so there's a difference
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
already in law they have to get parental
 
03:58:34.349 --> 03:58:34.359 align:start position:0%
consent on non-academic surveys so
 
03:58:36.590 --> 03:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's already in law are they getting
 
03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
them on cupcakes lunch of course not
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
that we we discussed this with the
 
03:58:44.309 --> 03:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
original Law this was not the intent of
 
03:58:46.750 --> 03:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
the original Law to you need to get
 
03:58:48.790 --> 03:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
parental Comm permission if you want to
 
03:58:51.189 --> 03:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
have a cupcake party in your school this
 
03:58:53.070 --> 03:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
was specific that's why we even added
 
03:58:55.110 --> 03:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
the language in there that this is about
 
03:58:57.710 --> 03:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
the student social behavior this is
 
03:58:59.950 --> 03:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
sensitive private information that
 
03:59:02.429 --> 03:59:02.439 align:start position:0%
they're asking about go read the survey
 
03:59:04.950 --> 03:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
go at look at the questions their life
 
03:59:07.750 --> 03:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
their religion their sexual orientation
 
03:59:11.149 --> 03:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
their sexual activity so that was
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
discussed with the original BT so so
 
03:59:14.910 --> 03:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
we're already
 
03:59:19.070 --> 03:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
through that and yes um I had uh one
 
03:59:21.429 --> 03:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
school district that did have a have a
 
03:59:25.309 --> 03:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
student go around and uh survey other
 
03:59:27.830 --> 03:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
students so I read the survey I looked
 
03:59:31.469 --> 03:59:31.479 align:start position:0%
at the survey to make sure that it's not
 
03:59:33.550 --> 03:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
asking about cupcakes in in a social
 
03:59:36.070 --> 03:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
science class but there were highly
 
03:59:38.550 --> 03:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
sensitive questions in what a student
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
was going around and asking their
 
03:59:43.349 --> 03:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
friends now this is information going to
 
03:59:44.830 --> 03:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
a student
 
03:59:47.950 --> 03:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
in the school about sexual orientation
 
03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
maybe that child doesn't want to reveal
 
03:59:53.429 --> 03:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
that maybe that child will say no but
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
the point is this was a way for parents
 
04:00:00.790 --> 04:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
to also look at kind of controlling the
 
04:00:02.670 --> 04:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
information that comes out about their
 
04:00:06.110 --> 04:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
child in a school setting um it's a lot
 
04:00:08.429 --> 04:00:08.439 align:start position:0%
of information it's a lot of data I
 
04:00:09.710 --> 04:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if that answered your
 
04:00:13.269 --> 04:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
question but um if not I'm happy to
 
04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:18.670 --> 04:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing further thank you very
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:44.030 --> 04:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
Wilder sorry uh good afternoon my my
 
04:00:46.110 --> 04:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
name is Jam Wilder and I'm from Campton
 
04:00:48.510 --> 04:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um thank you for allowing
 
04:00:51.830 --> 04:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
me to speak on this um I am in support
 
04:00:56.269 --> 04:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
of this bill um I want to share my story
 
04:00:58.469 --> 04:00:58.479 align:start position:0%
with you uh a few years back my older
 
04:00:59.990 --> 04:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
two children were in school when they
 
04:01:02.070 --> 04:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
gave the youth risk assessment survey
 
04:01:04.110 --> 04:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
and at the time the law was that it was
 
04:01:07.710 --> 04:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
an opt out option and that was by law
 
04:01:09.510 --> 04:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
that the school had to give them 10 days
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
notice uh to decide whether or not they
 
04:01:14.630 --> 04:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
wanted their child to take it my school
 
04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
illegally uh gave the the test to the
 
04:01:19.550 --> 04:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
children and I got a phone call from
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
both of my kids at school uh horrified
 
04:01:24.309 --> 04:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
at what they were being asked and I'll
 
04:01:26.790 --> 04:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
share some of those things in a moment
 
04:01:30.070 --> 04:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
but a week following that uh survey we
 
04:01:32.670 --> 04:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
had a suicide in our district and there
 
04:01:36.389 --> 04:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
are six questions about suicide and Mar
 
04:01:38.990 --> 04:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
read one of them to you that are very
 
04:01:42.750 --> 04:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
very leading and um plant a lot of seeds
 
04:01:44.670 --> 04:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
for kids that might be struggling with
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
depression so I wanted to um I followed
 
04:01:49.469 --> 04:01:49.479 align:start position:0%
up with the school and I asked them to
 
04:01:52.349 --> 04:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
share the survey with the district so
 
04:01:53.590 --> 04:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
that other parents would have the
 
04:01:56.189 --> 04:01:56.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to their children I
 
04:01:58.389 --> 04:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
waited one year after this happened and
 
04:02:01.710 --> 04:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
tried uh to explain what was going on at
 
04:02:04.229 --> 04:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
a a school board meeting and I gave I
 
04:02:07.590 --> 04:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
read the six questions at that time the
 
04:02:10.429 --> 04:02:10.439 align:start position:0%
parents there were so upset to hear what
 
04:02:12.750 --> 04:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
they were asking the children and said
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
that I was attacking the parents that
 
04:02:16.349 --> 04:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
they started screaming at me shut down
 
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
my mic and didn't allow me to continue
 
04:02:21.070 --> 04:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
so I just want to let you know in that
 
04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
survey they don't even they ask
 
04:02:25.349 --> 04:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
questions about whe your sexual
 
04:02:28.550 --> 04:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
orientation and abuse and suicide and
 
04:02:31.510 --> 04:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
Body Image but things like where do you
 
04:02:34.349 --> 04:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
look for your pornography or do you look
 
04:02:36.429 --> 04:02:36.439 align:start position:0%
at it and then list all of the places
 
04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
that they can find it the drugs like
 
04:02:42.149 --> 04:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
that they list there were so many that I
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
had never even heard of as a parent and
 
04:02:47.469 --> 04:02:47.479 align:start position:0%
I had an experience with my daughter who
 
04:02:50.510 --> 04:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
struggled with body image issues after a
 
04:02:53.469 --> 04:02:53.479 align:start position:0%
survey given in a doctor's office and I
 
04:02:55.149 --> 04:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
want to bring this to your attention
 
04:02:57.710 --> 04:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
because I think often times we think
 
04:02:59.590 --> 04:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing something to help other
 
04:03:02.149 --> 04:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
people and not realizing how much we're
 
04:03:04.429 --> 04:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
damaging children by giving them
 
04:03:06.110 --> 04:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
information they don't know how to
 
04:03:10.269 --> 04:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
process and so I'm pleading with you
 
04:03:12.950 --> 04:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
that you would pass this bill and make
 
04:03:15.510 --> 04:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
it an optin option for the Youth risk
 
04:03:18.510 --> 04:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
assessment survey because these kids a
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
lot of them don't even know how to have
 
04:03:22.750 --> 04:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
a conversation with anyone else and
 
04:03:24.550 --> 04:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
these ideas are now planted in their
 
04:03:26.950 --> 04:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
heads and they don't know how to process
 
04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
them and so for to protect our children
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
and to be able to have real
 
04:03:34.710 --> 04:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
conversations about where they're at I
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
ask that you would give this information
 
04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
to the parents and allow them to protect
 
04:03:42.670 --> 04:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
the children thank you thank you very
 
04:03:44.469 --> 04:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
much for coming today
 
04:03:44.479 --> 04:03:46.389 align:start position:0%
much for coming today

wouldn't take a position on that um I am
 
04:04:22.030 --> 04:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
in opposition to uh the amendment that
 
04:04:23.870 --> 04:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
was offered this morning or this
 
04:04:25.870 --> 04:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon um that would remove the
 
04:04:27.309 --> 04:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
exception for the Youth risk behavior
 
04:04:31.030 --> 04:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
survey um for information purposes um I
 
04:04:33.590 --> 04:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
think there are a lot of Advocates um
 
04:04:37.149 --> 04:04:37.159 align:start position:0%
mental health uh substance use disorder
 
04:04:39.630 --> 04:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
um and otherwise youth groups who would
 
04:04:41.630 --> 04:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
be really interested in weighing in on
 
04:04:43.070 --> 04:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
this particular Amendment and I think
 
04:04:44.469 --> 04:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
they should be off heard the opportunity
 
04:04:48.110 --> 04:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
to speak um secondly I would just uh
 
04:04:49.590 --> 04:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
underscore the importance of the data
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
that we get from the youth risk behavior
 
04:04:54.429 --> 04:04:54.439 align:start position:0%
survey if it were to turn into an optin
 
04:04:56.710 --> 04:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
um survey we know how difficult it is
 
04:04:58.630 --> 04:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
just to get field trip permission forms
 
04:05:00.910 --> 04:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
back let alone um a permission slip for
 
04:05:04.990 --> 04:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
something like this um so I think the
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
amount of of parents who would um even
 
04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
have the knowledge that there's a
 
04:05:13.870 --> 04:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
permission slip going home um about this
 
04:05:16.309 --> 04:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh they wouldn't have enough data uh
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
from the survey to produce reliable
 
04:05:22.269 --> 04:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
results um and folks rely on this data
 
04:05:26.590 --> 04:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
um to ensure that we have um targeted in
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
interventions in our schools for kids
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
who are suffering from mental health
 
04:05:33.990 --> 04:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
issues bullying um healthy eating I'm
 
04:05:36.149 --> 04:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
trying to think of all the the great
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
programs that stem directly from ybs
 
04:05:42.429 --> 04:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
data it's also really critical for um
 
04:05:44.030 --> 04:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
people like me to be able to to track
 
04:05:45.309 --> 04:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
the data so that we know what
 
04:05:47.550 --> 04:05:47.560 align:start position:0%
interventions are working and I can help
 
04:05:50.670 --> 04:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
inform you all uh legislators about
 
04:05:54.309 --> 04:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what um policies and procedures
 
04:05:56.149 --> 04:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
would be most beneficial for our
 
04:05:58.750 --> 04:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
students um I'm happy to take any
 
04:06:01.550 --> 04:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
questions again I'm going to uh send
 
04:06:03.469 --> 04:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
some written testimony to follow up with
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
all of you about the amendment um and I
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
believe uh and I'll send this as well
 
04:06:09.149 --> 04:06:09.159 align:start position:0%
but I believe a few years ago a similar
 
04:06:11.469 --> 04:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
bill was introduced and there was a
 
04:06:13.790 --> 04:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
group of students who sent in video Tes
 
04:06:15.870 --> 04:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
that was really powerful on how they use
 
04:06:17.590 --> 04:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
the ybs
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
data thank you very much yes
 
04:06:22.750 --> 04:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman thank you Mr
 
04:06:24.309 --> 04:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:06:25.990 --> 04:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you the same question I
 
04:06:28.030 --> 04:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
asked Mrs Banfield do you have any sense
 
04:06:30.030 --> 04:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
of what happens to the data or after it
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
is disseminated sure thank you for the
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
question M uh representative um I
 
04:06:36.309 --> 04:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
believe the department is here and they
 
04:06:37.630 --> 04:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
would be able to clarify more
 
04:06:39.349 --> 04:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
specifically but my understanding is
 
04:06:41.030 --> 04:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
that the school collects the data it is
 
04:06:43.229 --> 04:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
completely anonymized and it's uh when
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's been taken and then it is
 
04:06:48.269 --> 04:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
aggregated so that um there's no way for
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
the data to be tied to a particular
 
04:06:53.550 --> 04:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
student um and then the data is used by
 
04:06:55.469 --> 04:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
um the school the district and the
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
department um to inform those programs
 
04:07:00.349 --> 04:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
that I
 
04:07:04.269 --> 04:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned thank you res representative s
 
04:07:05.670 --> 04:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and thank you for
 
04:07:08.309 --> 04:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned that
 
04:07:10.510 --> 04:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
the school uses the data to improve
 
04:07:12.389 --> 04:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
programs or to create to work with
 
04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
programs could you you just give us a
 
04:07:16.750 --> 04:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail about how those
 
04:07:20.469 --> 04:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
programs benefit um students sure um I'm
 
04:07:22.950 --> 04:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
thinking in particular of schools that
 
04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
have um data on um you know bullying
 
04:07:30.750 --> 04:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
let's say um we heard a bill earlier on
 
04:07:32.790 --> 04:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
bullying I think the ybs data can
 
04:07:35.309 --> 04:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
uncover instances where schools maybe
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
have students who are experiencing
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
bullying may not feel comfortable going
 
04:07:41.429 --> 04:07:41.439 align:start position:0%
directly to a teacher to say um I'm
 
04:07:43.469 --> 04:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
being bullied but they can say in this
 
04:07:45.389 --> 04:07:45.399 align:start position:0%
Sur and anonymously say I'm being
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
bullied and when the data comes back and
 
04:07:50.429 --> 04:07:50.439 align:start position:0%
shows that this school you know 20% of
 
04:07:53.109 --> 04:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
students have reported being bullied um
 
04:07:56.109 --> 04:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
the school can Implement um programs to
 
04:07:58.510 --> 04:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
help change the culture and climate of
 
04:08:00.950 --> 04:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
the school and make it more um friendly
 
04:08:04.030 --> 04:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
to all students so I think um in
 
04:08:05.790 --> 04:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
particular students really appreciate
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
having this opportunity to ask for help
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
anonymously um while while they don't um
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
get that individualized component
 
04:08:16.189 --> 04:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
because the data is completely Anonymous
 
04:08:18.670 --> 04:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
um if enough students report something
 
04:08:23.790 --> 04:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:26.830 --> 04:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
that yes representative the dve thank
 
04:08:29.590 --> 04:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question thank you uh
 
04:08:33.269 --> 04:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
so what you say I agree with um
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
but when students opt in you get that
 
04:08:40.389 --> 04:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
data thank you so much for your question
 
04:08:42.389 --> 04:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
I I want to just be really clear that
 
04:08:45.910 --> 04:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
when parents have to opt into something
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
in other states in other districts where
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
that change has been made there has not
 
04:08:52.469 --> 04:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
been enough um opt-in participation
 
04:08:55.469 --> 04:08:55.479 align:start position:0%
because parents get so many pieces of
 
04:08:57.630 --> 04:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
paper a day so many you know things they
 
04:08:59.630 --> 04:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
have to respond to a lot of times things
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
get lost in the shuffle we are hearing
 
04:09:03.630 --> 04:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
from Educators that it's hard getting
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
things back that students want
 
04:09:07.149 --> 04:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
permission slips to fund field trips
 
04:09:10.389 --> 04:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
even that is hard to get back so um
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
where there is not enough participation
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the survey the data is not reliable
 
04:09:17.229 --> 04:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
and so we wouldn't be able to use it to
 
04:09:20.389 --> 04:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
inform these programs follow up thank
 
04:09:22.510 --> 04:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
you um can you give me an idea of like
 
04:09:24.990 --> 04:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
percentage that you need to make a
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable deduction from something I do
 
04:09:29.910 --> 04:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
have that percentage somewhere I'm sorry
 
04:09:31.109 --> 04:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
I don't have it off the top of my head
 
04:09:34.990 --> 04:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:38.189 --> 04:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
you any other questions see none thank
 
04:09:45.710 --> 04:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:45.720 --> 04:09:50.710 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:09:50.710 --> 04:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:02.469 --> 04:10:02.479 align:start position:0%

to take a position on the underlying
 
04:10:28.349 --> 04:10:28.359 align:start position:0%
bill but uh we do have some concerns
 
04:10:30.030 --> 04:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
with the amendment propos Amendment
 
04:10:32.149 --> 04:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
language so we were here to discuss that
 
04:10:33.429 --> 04:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
and answer any questions that the
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
committee may have uh relative to the
 
04:10:38.750 --> 04:10:38.760 align:start position:0%

offer some yes so New Hampshire elim ybs
since

04:10:45.870 --> 04:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:10:48.109 --> 04:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
1993 uh starting
 
04:10:51.870 --> 04:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
1915 uh 2015 excuse me we did uh we
 
04:10:54.349 --> 04:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
started the the school sensus survey
 
04:10:56.950 --> 04:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
which to survey all the public high
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
schools uh for student from uh Grade 9
 
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
to2 for
 
04:11:06.790 --> 04:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
ybs um currently ybs has two format one
 
04:11:09.750 --> 04:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
is electronic format one is paper format
 
04:11:12.109 --> 04:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
depends on the school's uh preference
 
04:11:14.149 --> 04:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
and their resource uh most of the
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
schools uh based on our um approach our
 
04:11:20.189 --> 04:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
Outreach most of schools are taking
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
electronic surveys uh which means that
 
04:11:24.990 --> 04:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
there's no way that they can put their
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
um confidential uh information or
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
personal information on the survey it's
 
04:11:31.469 --> 04:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
so click next page click next page um
 
04:11:34.030 --> 04:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
for example um we do have several
 
04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
schools that a few schools that that are

schools to that the students know know
 
04:11:45.870 --> 04:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
that uh they should not write anything
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
other day their answers on the answer
 
04:11:52.389 --> 04:11:52.399 align:start position:0%

print out and also another part is the
 
04:12:01.149 --> 04:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
answer sheet answering sheet that has
 
04:12:04.189 --> 04:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
ABCDE on it students will just do the
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
circle when they hand out the um the the
 
04:12:10.990 --> 04:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
their result they handed out the both

the questionnaires and also the uh sheet
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
and we collect the answer sheet so we
 
04:12:19.109 --> 04:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
did educate and and um that uh Trend
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%

in od year so 2021 2023 and this year

2025 we have started ybs survey already
 
04:12:51.750 --> 04:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
um prior to the survey eared about
 
04:12:55.309 --> 04:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
around October or November dhh has
 
04:12:57.870 --> 04:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
posted the questionnaires for the next
 
04:13:02.830 --> 04:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
year on our website uh for the public to
 
04:13:06.030 --> 04:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
access um we also let the schools know
 
04:13:08.670 --> 04:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
that uh feel free to download the
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
questionnaire from DHS website posted on
 
04:13:15.630 --> 04:13:15.640 align:start position:0%
their own school um website or just to
 
04:13:18.389 --> 04:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
embod embedded the link to their
 
04:13:21.070 --> 04:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
school's website and we also provide up
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
our form to the schools and ask them or
 
04:13:26.269 --> 04:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
encourage them to do the Outreach to the
 
04:13:29.790 --> 04:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
parents uh for the up out form uh in
 
04:13:33.710 --> 04:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
order to take up in approach we did have
 
04:13:36.630 --> 04:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh one or two schooles in the past that
 
04:13:40.590 --> 04:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
they used opting approach however in the
 
04:13:44.349 --> 04:13:44.359 align:start position:0%
next survey cycle this back to the up
 
04:13:46.750 --> 04:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
out approach the reason is that they
 
04:13:48.950 --> 04:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
didn't get their school level report
 
04:13:51.469 --> 04:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
because for uping approach we were not
 
04:13:54.309 --> 04:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
able to produce not only the U
 
04:13:57.229 --> 04:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
meaningful overall aggregate statistic
 
04:13:59.710 --> 04:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
report but also to the school level
 
04:14:02.309 --> 04:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
report we were not able to provide them
 
04:14:05.750 --> 04:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
the school specific uh report for uh the
 
04:14:08.910 --> 04:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
schools to to to take a look at um all
 
04:14:10.990 --> 04:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
the options excuse me all the survey
 
04:14:12.870 --> 04:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
result that the student performed over
 
04:14:12.880 --> 04:14:14.429 align:start position:0%
result that the student performed over
in

04:14:14.429 --> 04:14:14.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:14:14.439 --> 04:14:16.269 align:start position:0%
in
answered

04:14:16.269 --> 04:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
answered
 
04:14:20.630 --> 04:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
um so yeah sorry sorry sorry yeah so we
 
04:14:23.550 --> 04:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify too that um as um
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
Brianna uh the other speaker from new
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
futures um mentioned as um you know for
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of DHHS has a road map
 
04:14:31.760 --> 04:14:32.990 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of DHHS has a road map
2024

04:14:32.990 --> 04:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
2024
 
04:14:35.870 --> 04:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
2025 um and that is specifically
 
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
focusing among other things on
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health uh to ensure that all
 
04:14:41.710 --> 04:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
youth in the grand State have um the
 
04:14:44.349 --> 04:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
mental health um services that they need
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
and a good uh children's system of care
 
04:14:49.950 --> 04:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
so for the the 2023 results that were
 
04:14:52.750 --> 04:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
released um from DHHS and I think it was
 
04:14:54.429 --> 04:14:54.439 align:start position:0%
in coordination with the Department of
 
04:14:58.030 --> 04:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
Education for um the 2023 results it did
 
04:15:01.830 --> 04:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
show um Market um some challenges in the
 
04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire with um youth mental
 
04:15:06.830 --> 04:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
health and the ybs is an intrical tool
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
for the Department to track um and to
 
04:15:12.189 --> 04:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
try to address uh you know serious
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
issues of depression 40% of students
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
reported they had persistent feelings of
 
04:15:18.990 --> 04:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
sadness or hopelessness in 2023 um even
 
04:15:21.469 --> 04:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
though that was a decrease uh from 44%
 
04:15:23.790 --> 04:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
in 2021 these kind of figures give us
 
04:15:25.950 --> 04:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
some tools onto where you know what how
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
to address that and how to better help
 
04:15:31.630 --> 04:15:31.640 align:start position:0%
um to improve youth mental health um so
 
04:15:33.790 --> 04:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
the percentage of uh students that we
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
are able to help is greatly improved by
 
04:15:37.950 --> 04:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
the data that we receive from the yrbs
 
04:15:39.510 --> 04:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
like how how is New Hampshire doing a
 
04:15:41.389 --> 04:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
snapshat on what school districts might
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
need additional assistance with students
 
04:15:46.950 --> 04:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
looking at um issues of nutrition um
 
04:15:48.550 --> 04:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
bullying as as the previous speaker
 
04:15:50.630 --> 04:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned and uh able to have the
 
04:15:53.630 --> 04:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
department assist with um looking at
 
04:15:55.149 --> 04:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
just like what is the state of Youth
 
04:15:57.109 --> 04:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
mental health um with students I mean
 
04:15:58.750 --> 04:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
that's a hugely important thing as we
 
04:16:01.269 --> 04:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
move forward um into this new 2025 when
 
04:16:03.429 --> 04:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
there will be another um youth risk
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
behavior survey and as chawee mentioned
 
04:16:08.030 --> 04:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
um it's just crucial that the department
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
um be able to receive this important
 
04:16:12.309 --> 04:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
data on a snapshot on how how youth are
 
04:16:13.830 --> 04:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
doing in New campure with mental health
 
04:16:15.550 --> 04:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
it's critically important for the for
 
04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
the for those students and also for the
 
04:16:19.710 --> 04:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
future of um school districts and and
 
04:16:21.590 --> 04:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
how they might be uh best able to
 
04:16:25.950 --> 04:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
address those needs if I may
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
sorry so um so for the questionnaire it
 
04:16:33.189 --> 04:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
has basically six topics uh including
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
the sexual behavior and also U mental
 
04:16:38.990 --> 04:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
health it also include uh alcohol
 
04:16:42.990 --> 04:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
consume or alcohol excuse me uh risk and
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
also injury safety like whether um you
 
04:16:48.870 --> 04:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
know you you you put a seat belt or o
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
helmet while you ride a bicycle or
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
driving or drinkle driving or tax
 
04:16:56.429 --> 04:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
driving this type of injury or safety uh
 
04:16:59.469 --> 04:16:59.479 align:start position:0%
question is it also ask about uh how you
 
04:17:02.149 --> 04:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
feel about yourself whether students uh
 
04:17:05.070 --> 04:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
voice is important to the community or
 
04:17:07.149 --> 04:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
to the school whether you know school
 
04:17:09.950 --> 04:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
should uh take into account the the uh
 
04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
The Voice or the comment from students
 
04:17:13.469 --> 04:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
this type of question
 
04:17:15.950 --> 04:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
so it has a variety and also included
 
04:17:19.630 --> 04:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
physical activity nutrition Etc so it's
 
04:17:23.149 --> 04:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
not just focus on um sexual behavior or
 
04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
mental health but it has a variety of uh
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
questions in in among those six topics I
 
04:17:31.510 --> 04:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
just want to emphasize that and the
 
04:17:34.510 --> 04:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
questionnaire uh selection is based on
 
04:17:37.790 --> 04:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
um the CDC standard questionnaires pools
 
04:17:42.149 --> 04:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
that we um each state if they are y BS
 
04:17:46.189 --> 04:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
we will select at Le 23 from the CDC
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
standard pools and we are not able to
 
04:17:51.710 --> 04:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
change the question wording because um
 
04:17:53.790 --> 04:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
it focus on the time Trend if there's
 
04:17:55.950 --> 04:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
some wording change we are not able to
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
do the time Trend so for the
 
04:17:59.630 --> 04:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
questionnaire selection and also what
 
04:18:03.630 --> 04:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
topics are included uh it's it's very is
 
04:18:03.640 --> 04:18:06.950 align:start position:0%
topics are included uh it's it's very is
very

04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:11.070 --> 04:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
broad any questions representative drive
 
04:18:12.309 --> 04:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:18:14.469 --> 04:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
question i' I'd like to follow up on the
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
previous um speaker that asked when we
 
04:18:20.590 --> 04:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
asked about how much data makes good
 
04:18:23.189 --> 04:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
data I mean what percentage do you need
 
04:18:25.070 --> 04:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:18:28.590 --> 04:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
that um that's a very good question and
 
04:18:31.070 --> 04:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so for the
 
04:18:33.389 --> 04:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
survey we look for the survey data or
 
04:18:36.269 --> 04:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
analysis we do look into um whether this
 
04:18:40.109 --> 04:18:40.119 align:start position:0%
a reliable or not reliable we do have
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
um an algorithm to do the statistic
 
04:18:46.309 --> 04:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
analysis to compare the confidence
 
04:18:49.750 --> 04:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
interval so if there's only few survey
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
then the confidence interval will be
 
04:18:53.429 --> 04:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
pretty big and then we are not able to
 
04:18:57.070 --> 04:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
compare from one area to the other area
 
04:18:59.710 --> 04:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
if there is a more uh sample size that
 
04:19:02.910 --> 04:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
is reliable then yes so U Back to your
 
04:19:05.469 --> 04:19:05.479 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm not able to provide
 
04:19:08.229 --> 04:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
like a you know
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
10% sample or versus 90% sample of
 
04:19:14.710 --> 04:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
course 90% sample SLE would be better so
 
04:19:17.070 --> 04:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
um and the concern on the up in is
 
04:19:19.710 --> 04:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
really about we will not be able to get
 
04:19:22.510 --> 04:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
enough sample size in order to generate
 
04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
the meaningful and statistical uh
 
04:19:29.950 --> 04:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:31.790 --> 04:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
major H
 
04:19:34.630 --> 04:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
up okay so you're you're narrowing in on
 
04:19:36.910 --> 04:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
it but that really doesn't tell me
 
04:19:38.750 --> 04:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
enough is enough but what's
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
enough um it just doesn't seem like
 
04:19:45.109 --> 04:19:45.119 align:start position:0%
and how much do you think you would lose
 
04:19:47.630 --> 04:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
from between opt in and opt out I think
 
04:19:54.030 --> 04:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.149 --> 04:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
question yeah so um currently most of
 
04:19:59.309 --> 04:19:59.319 align:start position:0%
the Stu uh schools excuse me are taking
 
04:20:04.870 --> 04:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
up out approach so typically um for ybs
 
04:20:07.149 --> 04:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
we need to have
 
04:20:10.630 --> 04:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
60% uh of students who take the
 
04:20:15.229 --> 04:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
surveying order to get 60 yes and that
 
04:20:17.550 --> 04:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
counts not only the student
 
04:20:20.349 --> 04:20:20.359 align:start position:0%
participation but also the numbers of
 
04:20:24.189 --> 04:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
schools in that um uh in the public
 
04:20:27.229 --> 04:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
health regions um so that the two Factor
 
04:20:30.189 --> 04:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
time together in order to get 60% so for
 
04:20:33.109 --> 04:20:33.119 align:start position:0%
example if in one Public Health Region
 
04:20:35.670 --> 04:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just taking maybe greater National
 
04:20:39.070 --> 04:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
as a example um sorry I don't have top
 
04:20:41.109 --> 04:20:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh the number of top of my head how many
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
public schools there but but if it only
 
04:20:47.469 --> 04:20:47.479 align:start position:0%
has two schools out of five schools that
 
04:20:50.910 --> 04:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
are using uh taking ybs or commit that
 
04:20:52.030 --> 04:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
they will do
 
04:20:55.469 --> 04:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
ybs if there are 100% of student for
 
04:20:58.790 --> 04:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
those two schools complete the survey we
 
04:21:01.269 --> 04:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
still won't get the Reginal data because
 
04:21:02.590 --> 04:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
it's less than
 
04:21:05.469 --> 04:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
60% so it's not just about the student
 
04:21:08.349 --> 04:21:08.359 align:start position:0%
participation it also about the uh
 
04:21:11.830 --> 04:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
School participation and while bsso uh
 
04:21:14.550 --> 04:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
voluntaries so we don't put a mandatory
 
04:21:17.149 --> 04:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
that the school needs to
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
participate thank you that's thank you
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
represent Murray thank you madam chair
 
04:21:24.630 --> 04:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I think
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
you started to hit on something that I
 
04:21:28.349 --> 04:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
was thinking about and you you mentioned
 
04:21:30.790 --> 04:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
the regionality of of maybe results or
 
04:21:34.590 --> 04:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
findings it is there through the yrbs
 
04:21:36.309 --> 04:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
are there data informed decisions that
 
04:21:39.870 --> 04:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
would change potentially
 
04:21:42.910 --> 04:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
regionally I'm sorry if I un your
 
04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
question correctly uh are you asking
 
04:21:47.710 --> 04:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
whether the result will change the
 
04:21:50.349 --> 04:21:50.359 align:start position:0%
regional prevention programs
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
or um so for this part I am not the best
 
04:21:57.510 --> 04:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
person to um talk about how the data is
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
used because it's being used for various
 
04:22:03.269 --> 04:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
programs and also Public Health regions
 
04:22:06.309 --> 04:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire on their preventions
 
04:22:09.590 --> 04:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and also maybe um the local
 
04:22:11.950 --> 04:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
communities to look into their own
 
04:22:14.670 --> 04:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
Regional data and also some schools are
 
04:22:17.670 --> 04:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
willing to share their data with public
 
04:22:20.229 --> 04:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
or public publish post their result
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
online and then the Schoolboard or the
 
04:22:25.790 --> 04:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
um parents will be have will have the uh
 
04:22:28.109 --> 04:22:28.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at the school data
 
04:22:30.870 --> 04:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
but as far as I understand it focus on
 
04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
prevention so like a tobacco use like uh
 
04:22:36.550 --> 04:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
sexual behavior and like what Abby
 
04:22:39.149 --> 04:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
mention about mental health to find the
 
04:22:43.109 --> 04:22:43.119 align:start position:0%
support so um for Department
 
04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh we did publish some kind like a uh a
 
04:22:51.269 --> 04:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
b show or Q&amp;A where if you if if you are
 
04:22:54.670 --> 04:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
seeing this um questions or if you have
 
04:22:58.389 --> 04:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
this type of um concerns please contact
 
04:23:00.870 --> 04:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
this hotline this hline so we do have
 
04:23:03.870 --> 04:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
that type of information posted on our
 
04:23:06.510 --> 04:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
uh website and this was this is the
 
04:23:09.309 --> 04:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
result from uh one hearings regarding
 
04:23:12.990 --> 04:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
ybs bills that we uh take a serious to
 
04:23:15.710 --> 04:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
see if what type of services or
 
04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
resources the department can provide so
 
04:23:21.670 --> 04:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
we do have that uh resource for for the
 
04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
general public to be able to look into
 
04:23:26.790 --> 04:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
our students if they want to look for
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
some kind like a resource for them
 
04:23:31.630 --> 04:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
themselves sometimes they may not have
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
um you know um an ad doubt that they
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
they can trust or they rely on to
 
04:23:40.269 --> 04:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
discuss their own um concerns then that
 
04:23:42.830 --> 04:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
part is what we what we distribute build
 
04:23:45.189 --> 04:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
and and available on our website in
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
terms of how programs look use the data
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
overseeing the data I think the um
 
04:23:52.990 --> 04:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
partner from new future has uh provide
 
04:23:55.870 --> 04:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
some information and if we we can follow
 
04:23:58.109 --> 04:23:58.119 align:start position:0%
up and then provide more information how
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
how progr areas are using the data or
 
04:24:02.790 --> 04:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
how the local uh communities are using
 
04:24:02.800 --> 04:24:03.990 align:start position:0%
how the local uh communities are using
the

04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:06.149 --> 04:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
data thank
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
Balon thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um there has
 
04:24:16.469 --> 04:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
been brought up some concerns about uh
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
student data privacy um and how and and
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
the vendors that that you use to collect
 
04:24:29.070 --> 04:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
this information how is this uh data uh
 
04:24:33.469 --> 04:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
being the Privacy being contained and um
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
how confident are you given that there
 
04:24:39.630 --> 04:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
have been data breaches and other um
 
04:24:41.630 --> 04:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
formats that we've seen as power school
 
04:24:43.670 --> 04:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
has been brought up for how how do we
 
04:24:46.349 --> 04:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
know student data is
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
safe uh thank you for the questions so
 
04:24:52.349 --> 04:24:52.359 align:start position:0%
first of all ybs is a nominal so we do
 
04:24:55.510 --> 04:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
not collect any personal informations we
 
04:24:57.670 --> 04:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
do collect or the survey does collect
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
which grade you are in uh and also your
 
04:25:04.109 --> 04:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
height your weight and gender etc those
 
04:25:06.550 --> 04:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
are the basic demographic information
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
that we collect uh and so for the
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
further uh statistic analysis for focus
 
04:25:15.109 --> 04:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
on different type of uh demographic
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
group um among the students um excuse me
 
04:25:23.109 --> 04:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
so we currently have a vendor that uh we
 
04:25:26.429 --> 04:25:26.439 align:start position:0%
utilize to administer ybs for both
 
04:25:29.550 --> 04:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
electronic survey and also the uh paper
 
04:25:31.830 --> 04:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
survey for electronic survey we are
 
04:25:35.510 --> 04:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
using recap application which is a hipop
 
04:25:39.550 --> 04:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
compliant um software that um using to
 
04:25:42.750 --> 04:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
collect the data uh for the electron
 
04:25:47.590 --> 04:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
um format it does not capture any
 
04:25:50.510 --> 04:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
personal identifiers and for school over
 
04:25:54.830 --> 04:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
the classroom ID which is randomized we
 
04:25:57.269 --> 04:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
do have the school ID we we know so we
 
04:25:59.710 --> 04:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
know which school is from the classroom
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
ID is randomized um uh based after the
 
04:26:07.349 --> 04:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
school submit their uh class roster and
 
04:26:10.149 --> 04:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
then the department randomized the the
 
04:26:13.309 --> 04:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
the school ID so the school ID and also
 
04:26:17.189 --> 04:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
the um class ID are captured into the
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
record but it's randomized so we have no
 
04:26:23.710 --> 04:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
way without looking into specific form
 
04:26:27.389 --> 04:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
to know where um you know those those
 
04:26:30.229 --> 04:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
group of Records is from in terms of a
 
04:26:33.269 --> 04:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
security and privacy approach uh whether
 
04:26:36.269 --> 04:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
the school is taking electronic format
 
04:26:38.710 --> 04:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
or the paper format
 
04:26:42.269 --> 04:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
we um require the school in the class
 
04:26:45.229 --> 04:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
room setting they need to have at least
 
04:26:47.910 --> 04:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
five students taking the survey at the
 
04:26:51.710 --> 04:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
same time so if if on the survey dat
 
04:26:54.550 --> 04:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
there are only four students or two
 
04:26:58.109 --> 04:26:58.119 align:start position:0%
students in the classroom we ask the
 
04:27:00.309 --> 04:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
school or the school coordinator to
 
04:27:03.189 --> 04:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
merge or group those student in with
 
04:27:05.950 --> 04:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
other classroom so the classroom setting
 
04:27:08.590 --> 04:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
this to have at least five students in
 
04:27:10.950 --> 04:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
the classroom and the classroom setting
 
04:27:13.109 --> 04:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
need to be separated so they won't be
 
04:27:16.309 --> 04:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
able to Peck other people's screen over
 
04:27:19.070 --> 04:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
to look at what other people are are
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
answering so that is the safety um
 
04:27:24.149 --> 04:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
approach and to protect privacy and
 
04:27:26.790 --> 04:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
confidentiality that we require the
 
04:27:30.349 --> 04:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
schools uh to take um as this type of
 
04:27:34.630 --> 04:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
approach and how confidence the data is
 
04:27:34.640 --> 04:27:35.870 align:start position:0%
approach and how confidence the data is
excuse

04:27:35.870 --> 04:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
04:27:39.870 --> 04:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
me is secure first of all it is a ninous
 
04:27:42.990 --> 04:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
so um I personally do not believe
 
04:27:46.950 --> 04:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
there's a way that the school or the uh
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
teacher will be able to identify which
 
04:27:52.269 --> 04:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
one and then take it out uh that that
 
04:27:54.830 --> 04:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's not even though that's what we
 
04:27:58.030 --> 04:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
have heard uh during the hearings but I
 
04:28:00.149 --> 04:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that I don't I I don't
 
04:28:02.510 --> 04:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
believe that is feasible and for the
 
04:28:05.750 --> 04:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
electronic uh format we did get one or
 
04:28:08.870 --> 04:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
two request to remove one record or two
 
04:28:11.309 --> 04:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
record we are not able to do that so in
 
04:28:12.990 --> 04:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
order to do that that we will need to
 
04:28:15.229 --> 04:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
remove the entire classroom or entire
 
04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
School record then that means there's no
 
04:28:22.349 --> 04:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:25.349 --> 04:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
school thank you thank you
 
04:28:27.870 --> 04:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
representative celik thank you and thank
 
04:28:31.670 --> 04:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um would it
 
04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
be safe to say that um because this is
 
04:28:36.189 --> 04:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
given at the the specific survey you're
 
04:28:37.590 --> 04:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
addressing as given at the high school
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
level that students at the high school
 
04:28:42.790 --> 04:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
level may not disclose information to
 
04:28:44.910 --> 04:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
their parents about their current mental
 
04:28:48.670 --> 04:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
health feelings or their current um drug
 
04:28:51.030 --> 04:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
or alcohol use or their current sexual
 
04:28:54.710 --> 04:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
activity with their parents and might um
 
04:28:56.389 --> 04:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
that the survey might identify that
 
04:28:58.830 --> 04:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
there's a an area where there's
 
04:29:02.510 --> 04:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
significant uh risk behaviors occurring
 
04:29:04.750 --> 04:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
that might need to be addressed in the
 
04:29:08.109 --> 04:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
community without identifying targets uh
 
04:29:10.550 --> 04:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
yes that that is correct so we do
 
04:29:14.109 --> 04:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
encourage students to talk to um if they
 
04:29:16.910 --> 04:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
have any concern to talk to um any
 
04:29:19.750 --> 04:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
adults that they trust May that may be
 
04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
their parents that may be their
 
04:29:25.149 --> 04:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
guardians or maybe uh School teachers um
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
so so for for the survey we also
 
04:29:32.790 --> 04:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
encourage parents to look into uh our
 
04:29:35.149 --> 04:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
questions or questionnaires online
 
04:29:38.109 --> 04:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
however we also um we do not encourage
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
the parents discuss with the student
 
04:29:44.109 --> 04:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
prior to the surve but after the surveys
 
04:29:47.510 --> 04:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
definitely to to to understand oh uh
 
04:29:49.349 --> 04:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
what do you think about this question
 
04:29:51.830 --> 04:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
how do you think um how important do you
 
04:29:54.189 --> 04:29:54.199 align:start position:0%
think your voice uh should be heard by
 
04:29:57.790 --> 04:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
the school Etc um this this type of um
 
04:30:01.109 --> 04:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
discussion we do encourage um parents
 
04:30:03.710 --> 04:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
and and and student to talk to the um
 
04:30:06.189 --> 04:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
you know uh to talk to each other and
 
04:30:09.429 --> 04:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
for for the surve the purpose is is to
 
04:30:13.109 --> 04:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
hear the true voice from the students
 
04:30:16.630 --> 04:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
and sometimes this is something that we
 
04:30:19.710 --> 04:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
probably cannot get like a just as face
 
04:30:23.429 --> 04:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
by face for per se so this this surve
 
04:30:26.030 --> 04:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
this survey excuse me provide a a
 
04:30:29.870 --> 04:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism for the student to answer um
 
04:30:31.950 --> 04:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
we we we would like to have their
 
04:30:35.950 --> 04:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
truthful answer on each questions uh
 
04:30:38.670 --> 04:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
another part that I I I didn't I forgot
 
04:30:40.630 --> 04:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
to mention I think it's very important
 
04:30:43.790 --> 04:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
is the survey is voluntary so students
 
04:30:47.309 --> 04:30:47.319 align:start position:0%
can up out themsel out any time if they
 
04:30:49.950 --> 04:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
do not want to answer any question they
 
04:30:52.349 --> 04:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
do not need to answer they just skip it
 
04:30:55.870 --> 04:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
skip it um the only requirement that we
 
04:30:59.229 --> 04:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
have is in order to provide um protect
 
04:31:02.109 --> 04:31:02.119 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality and privacy once the
 
04:31:05.109 --> 04:31:05.119 align:start position:0%
survey start student will need to sit
 
04:31:07.630 --> 04:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
there until the survey ends they don't
 
04:31:10.950 --> 04:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
need to do any questions if they are not
 
04:31:13.070 --> 04:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this question or
 
04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
provide their answer so that is another
 
04:31:20.269 --> 04:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
um information that we uh as the school
 
04:31:23.269 --> 04:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
to distribute to the student prior to
 
04:31:26.030 --> 04:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
the survey that they if they don't feel
 
04:31:27.790 --> 04:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable answering any questions they
 
04:31:31.149 --> 04:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
can Skip and we don't know who Skip what
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
um because we want to have the truthful
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
answer another um uh PRI privacy
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism that we take I fail to answer
 
04:31:44.309 --> 04:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
provide that information is that during
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
the survey uh period of time no one can
 
04:31:51.309 --> 04:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
walk around the teacher cannot answer
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
any question from the students the
 
04:31:56.229 --> 04:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
teacher cannot walk around either the
 
04:31:58.910 --> 04:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
teacher will be there uh and once the
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
survey is complete over the time is up
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
student hand back if it's paper survey
 
04:32:06.510 --> 04:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
hand back there answer sheet uh if it's
 
04:32:09.229 --> 04:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
electronic survey they just click submit
 
04:32:12.189 --> 04:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
and then for electronic survey we
 
04:32:15.189 --> 04:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
provide access code to each student we
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't know who will get what access code
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
um and once the survey is done the
 
04:32:23.109 --> 04:32:23.119 align:start position:0%
access code will be invalid they will
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
not be able to take the survey home and
 
04:32:28.349 --> 04:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
answer they have to answer it uh during
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
that period of time that uh School
 
04:32:33.950 --> 04:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
identified or set
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
up representative
 
04:32:39.109 --> 04:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:32:41.070 --> 04:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
for coming in front of us and answering
 
04:32:42.870 --> 04:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
my question actually two questions if I
 
04:32:46.349 --> 04:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
may thank you um how long has this this
 
04:32:48.189 --> 04:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
survey been administered how many years
 
04:32:50.189 --> 04:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
have we been U participating in this in
 
04:32:52.990 --> 04:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for New Hampshire we uh
 
04:32:55.229 --> 04:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
started doing this in
 
04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
1993 and in the past it was the
 
04:33:02.510 --> 04:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
collaboration uh between DHHS and the
 
04:33:06.189 --> 04:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and starting
 
04:33:09.949 --> 04:33:09.959 align:start position:0%
2025 uh it's it's it's purely elimary by
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
DHHS so starting 19 93 New Hampshire has
 
04:33:15.029 --> 04:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
been participating in
 
04:33:18.990 --> 04:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
yrbs thank you and may I thank you um
 
04:33:21.429 --> 04:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
you've stated numerous times that that
 
04:33:23.429 --> 04:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
the survey is completely
 
04:33:26.429 --> 04:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
Anonymous if that's so how do we alert
 
04:33:30.070 --> 04:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
parents if specific problems come up
 
04:33:32.510 --> 04:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
with each student in other words if
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
there are problems why wouldn't we be
 
04:33:36.990 --> 04:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
able to alert the
 
04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:44.029 --> 04:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
you you stated numerous times that the
 
04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
survey results and the survey itself are
 
04:33:48.869 --> 04:33:48.879 align:start position:0%
completely Anonymous there's no personal
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
pupil identifying number on those now if
 
04:33:53.869 --> 04:33:53.879 align:start position:0%
there are problems and say there's an
 
04:33:55.390 --> 04:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
alcohol problem with one of those
 
04:33:57.390 --> 04:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
children who has filled out that survey
 
04:33:58.910 --> 04:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't the first line of defense
 
04:34:00.470 --> 04:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
be to go to the parents and let them
 
04:34:02.510 --> 04:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
know that there's a problem instead of
 
04:34:05.070 --> 04:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
taking all this information um
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
aggregating it and just sending it out
 
04:34:08.789 --> 04:34:08.799 align:start position:0%
into the ethos why wouldn't we be
 
04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:17.269 --> 04:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question uh I guess
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
I would say on that is it is supposed to
 
04:34:21.551 --> 04:34:21.561 align:start position:0%
be an anonymous survey it's a it's a
 
04:34:23.470 --> 04:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
aggregate data of what is going on in
 
04:34:25.990 --> 04:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
the school um as part of the par
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
parental permission for taking the
 
04:34:30.551 --> 04:34:30.561 align:start position:0%
survey uh which we provide to parents
 
04:34:32.029 --> 04:34:32.039 align:start position:0%
they are they have access to the survey
 
04:34:34.390 --> 04:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
they have access to questions and um I
 
04:34:37.310 --> 04:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
guess best practice would be uh to maybe
 
04:34:38.709 --> 04:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
you know if you had concerns as a parent
 
04:34:39.990 --> 04:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
be able to discuss that with your
 
04:34:41.949 --> 04:34:41.959 align:start position:0%
children or discuss in general if you
 
04:34:44.150 --> 04:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
were going to um if your child was going
 
04:34:46.349 --> 04:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
to take the survey to to maybe um it
 
04:34:47.750 --> 04:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
would be a good opportunity to talk
 
04:34:48.990 --> 04:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
about some of those subjects that might
 
04:34:51.390 --> 04:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
be problematic without you know sort of
 
04:34:53.070 --> 04:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
calling out an individual student
 
04:34:54.670 --> 04:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
because for our purposes it's a general
 
04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
public health um healthy of health of
 
04:34:58.830 --> 04:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
the community the school Community
 
04:35:01.230 --> 04:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
without singling out children or or and
 
04:35:02.990 --> 04:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
that in it in itself would be sort of a
 
04:35:03.000 --> 04:35:06.029 align:start position:0%
that in it in itself would be sort of a
privacy

04:35:06.029 --> 04:35:06.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:08.709 --> 04:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
concern well thank you madam CH and
 
04:35:11.310 --> 04:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question um I
 
04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
I do understand what you're saying um
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
however the parents are the first line
 
04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
of defense so I I am curious as to why
 
04:35:22.910 --> 04:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have a mechanism in place to
 
04:35:24.990 --> 04:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
alert a parent if a question on that
 
04:35:28.109 --> 04:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
survey is problematic to that student if
 
04:35:30.709 --> 04:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
they're having suicide radiation I think
 
04:35:31.949 --> 04:35:31.959 align:start position:0%
that parent should be alerted
 
04:35:34.590 --> 04:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
immediately but by this mechanism it
 
04:35:36.029 --> 04:35:36.039 align:start position:0%
can't be because it's completely
 
04:35:37.869 --> 04:35:37.879 align:start position:0%
Anonymous so the point I'm trying to
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
make is is there any way number one that
 
04:35:42.910 --> 04:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
we could add a layer of notification
 
04:35:45.949 --> 04:35:45.959 align:start position:0%
even though it is anonymous um or you
 
04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
know number two um maybe this
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
information isn't as Anonymous as we
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
thought that's basically what I'm trying
 
04:35:56.590 --> 04:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
to yeah thank you for the questions so
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
basically um the survey provides some
 
04:36:02.470 --> 04:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
data to understand what's going on in
 
04:36:05.629 --> 04:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
the specific schools and also specific
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
communities if there is any um survey
 
04:36:12.310 --> 04:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
result that shows that this Community
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
has high percentage of student who
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
consider or who has considered suicide
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
or who attempt suicide then yes that
 
04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
will alert that um in order to I mean to
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
alert the the parents in of time that
 
04:36:32.470 --> 04:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
would be the efforts from the schools
 
04:36:34.990 --> 04:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
and also maybe the local community uh
 
04:36:38.470 --> 04:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
program areas uh to do so uh for the
 
04:36:42.189 --> 04:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
survey is to provide some supporting
 
04:36:46.390 --> 04:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
um numbers or data for their own
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
work I know I probably don't answer
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
before answer your question I'm sorry I
 
04:36:53.830 --> 04:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't rolling my eyes was rolling at
 
04:36:57.910 --> 04:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
the phone like you what can you call me
 
04:37:01.029 --> 04:37:01.039 align:start position:0%
later representative Cel thank you I I
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
had a follow-up question from my
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
questions earlier and I appreciate you
 
04:37:07.150 --> 04:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
taking my questions so we're looking at
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
this as aggregate data about a
 
04:37:11.230 --> 04:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
particular school and this maybe follows
 
04:37:12.551 --> 04:37:12.561 align:start position:0%
up with some of the other questions that
 
04:37:15.390 --> 04:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
been asked if we're identifying for
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
example you talked about a mental health
 
04:37:19.949 --> 04:37:19.959 align:start position:0%
Spike uh issue Spike over the years
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
which makes sense especially as a parent
 
04:37:25.910 --> 04:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
of teenagers during that time so would
 
04:37:29.390 --> 04:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
that data then allow a district say the
 
04:37:32.590 --> 04:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
the red School District um to say okay
 
04:37:34.029 --> 04:37:34.039 align:start position:0%
we've just gotten this data that shows
 
04:37:36.551 --> 04:37:36.561 align:start position:0%
we've got a 20% increase in students
 
04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
saying they're experiencing mental
 
04:37:41.590 --> 04:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
health challenges we need to think about
 
04:37:43.789 --> 04:37:43.799 align:start position:0%
allocating our school budget to ensure
 
04:37:45.510 --> 04:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we've got more mental health
 
04:37:47.230 --> 04:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
support or we've got some more training
 
04:37:49.470 --> 04:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
for our teachers and how to manage the
 
04:37:51.551 --> 04:37:51.561 align:start position:0%
situation and also create some kind of
 
04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
Outreach for our greater community so
 
04:37:56.070 --> 04:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
our parents can learn you know can
 
04:37:58.269 --> 04:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
identify ways to support their children
 
04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
and and have conversations because maybe
 
04:38:03.150 --> 04:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
the parents don't know how to have the
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
conversation yes absolutely and that's
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
what we would like to um schools or the
 
04:38:12.029 --> 04:38:12.039 align:start position:0%
community to utilize this type of of a
 
04:38:14.189 --> 04:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
report but the bottom line is we will
 
04:38:16.269 --> 04:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
need to get enough simple size in order
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
to provide this type of statistic
 
04:38:20.910 --> 04:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
analysis or to the school or to the
 
04:38:20.920 --> 04:38:23.869 align:start position:0%
analysis or to the school or to the
certain

04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
communities any other
 
04:38:31.629 --> 04:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:45.629 --> 04:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:49.150 --> 04:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chairman committee members um
 
04:38:51.310 --> 04:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
auy Freedman liveing Bridgewater private
 
04:38:54.551 --> 04:38:54.561 align:start position:0%
citizen I speak in support of this bill
 
04:38:58.109 --> 04:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
um parents need to know well first of
 
04:38:59.949 --> 04:38:59.959 align:start position:0%
all on these
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
surveys why are they even wasting all
 
04:39:04.109 --> 04:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
this time on it when the proficiency
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
rates are so low especially in math and
 
04:39:09.029 --> 04:39:09.039 align:start position:0%
science but okay they they do they've
 
04:39:10.750 --> 04:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
got them they're in the schools that's
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
that why shouldn't parents pay attention
 
04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
to what's in these surveys have you
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
actually looked at them I've seen them
 
04:39:21.189 --> 04:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
they're actually a little bit better now
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
I've been looking at them for a couple
 
04:39:24.070 --> 04:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
years I've been going to school board
 
04:39:26.429 --> 04:39:26.439 align:start position:0%
meetings for several years and they're
 
04:39:29.709 --> 04:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
not quite as nosy as they used to be the
 
04:39:33.070 --> 04:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
middle school is 50 questions and the
 
04:39:35.189 --> 04:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
high school is 85 it used to be I think
 
04:39:38.110 --> 04:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
like 110 or 111 for the high school
 
04:39:40.590 --> 04:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
really nosy questions asking about what
 
04:39:42.990 --> 04:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
goes on at home Home
 
04:39:47.990 --> 04:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
Fighting uh Firearms really nosy but
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
here I want to just read a couple the
 
04:39:51.310 --> 04:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
Middle School you would understand high
 
04:39:53.150 --> 04:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
school already they're they're older
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
Middle School this is from the middle
 
04:39:58.270 --> 04:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
school and I looked at the 2025
 
04:40:02.150 --> 04:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
version number 33 H again this is Middle
 
04:40:04.270 --> 04:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
School have you ever had sexual
 
04:40:07.390 --> 04:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
intercourse number 34 how old were you
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
when you had sexual sexual intercourse
 
04:40:12.830 --> 04:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
for the first time 35 how many with how
 
04:40:15.150 --> 04:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
many people have you ever had sexual
 
04:40:17.868 --> 04:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
intercourse 36 the last time you had
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
sexual intercourse did you or your
 
04:40:22.230 --> 04:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
partner use a condom I'm not stupid
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
enough to think that middle school kids
 
04:40:26.910 --> 04:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
don't have sex they probably do but I
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
think this is outrageous and they do ask
 
04:40:32.788 --> 04:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
questions about you know how many
 
04:40:35.708 --> 04:40:35.718 align:start position:0%
carrots you ate and how many potatoes or
 
04:40:37.628 --> 04:40:37.638 align:start position:0%
whatever they're not interested in that
 
04:40:39.990 --> 04:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
stuff trust me they want to know about
 
04:40:43.390 --> 04:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
the nitty-gritty stuff EXT and about of
 
04:40:45.110 --> 04:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
course sex and you know sexual
 
04:40:47.910 --> 04:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
orientation and all that identity stuff
 
04:40:50.510 --> 04:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
what business do they have asking all
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
those questions and I'll tell you why
 
04:40:54.670 --> 04:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
they because I've been going to these
 
04:40:56.590 --> 04:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
school board meetings for years and I
 
04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you whenever the question
 
04:41:00.310 --> 04:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
comes up about the youth risk uh
 
04:41:03.270 --> 04:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
Behavior survey uh people get all
 
04:41:05.390 --> 04:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
excited whoa they're doing it again the
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
data is coming out they just can't wait
 
04:41:09.788 --> 04:41:09.798 align:start position:0%
for it why do they want the data to show
 
04:41:11.948 --> 04:41:11.958 align:start position:0%
that the kids are so messed up up we
 
04:41:15.110 --> 04:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
need to hire more staff more Health
 
04:41:18.430 --> 04:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
experts to solve the problem the kids
 
04:41:21.070 --> 04:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
are so messed up how can they perform
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
academically when they're so messed up
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
and I want to give an example of how
 
04:41:28.470 --> 04:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
they do this stuff too because they love
 
04:41:32.750 --> 04:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
the youth risk behavior survey thing um
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:40.430 --> 04:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
here okay they like to cherry-pick the
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
questions that make make it look like
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
the kids are actually doing worse than
 
04:41:46.990 --> 04:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
oh I can't find it so I'll just remember
 
04:41:50.190 --> 04:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
it there was like a question about
 
04:41:54.510 --> 04:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
smoking and one question was um how
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
young were you when you smoked your
 
04:41:59.070 --> 04:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
first cigarette or something like that
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
and you know nine or 10 or 12 or
 
04:42:03.030 --> 04:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
whatever gives you various choices and
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
the next question was how often do you
 
04:42:09.430 --> 04:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
smoke a cigarettes you know every day or
 
04:42:12.070 --> 04:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
once a week or whatever so clearly the
 
04:42:14.670 --> 04:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
second question would be more relevant
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who's a habitual smoker would
 
04:42:20.670 --> 04:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
be of more of concern that somebody just
 
04:42:22.230 --> 04:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
like I actually smoked a cigarette when
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
I was 12 or 13 I never smoked again but
 
04:42:27.310 --> 04:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
if I answer the survey the first time I
 
04:42:29.070 --> 04:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
took it would be more you know and
 
04:42:32.390 --> 04:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of question they use for
 
04:42:34.948 --> 04:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
justification because I saw it on a
 
04:42:38.110 --> 04:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
presentation on the youth risk behavior
 
04:42:41.230 --> 04:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
survey I mean pick the most irrelevant
 
04:42:43.550 --> 04:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
question of all the the first time you
 
04:42:45.150 --> 04:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
did it and then maybe you never smoked a
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
cigarette again they want to show and
 
04:42:51.430 --> 04:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
again they cherry-pick the questions and
 
04:42:54.868 --> 04:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
answers to make it look worse so that we
 
04:42:56.990 --> 04:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
we got to hire more
 
04:43:01.270 --> 04:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
people um okay what else I I on the I
 
04:43:03.190 --> 04:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
think the there is an amendment I
 
04:43:08.150 --> 04:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it I guess to strike the uh
 
04:43:11.430 --> 04:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
the youth risk behavior survey so that
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
um there's an exemption right I believe
 
04:43:16.270 --> 04:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
so maybe I'm wrong but if there isn't
 
04:43:18.030 --> 04:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
there ought to be the youth risk
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
behavior survey is the worst one of them
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
all it's the granddaddy it's the nosiest
 
04:43:29.430 --> 04:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
and they just use it to further uh
 
04:43:32.550 --> 04:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
basically hiring more people and I don't
 
04:43:33.948 --> 04:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
and I think it takes away from the
 
04:43:36.430 --> 04:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
academics to be quite honest spending
 
04:43:39.070 --> 04:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
all this time on stuff so I do think
 
04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's a good uh bill I support it uh the
 
04:43:47.030 --> 04:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
clearly the uh Amendment about um taking
 
04:43:50.310 --> 04:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
out the um you know parental consent I
 
04:43:51.910 --> 04:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
wish parents would actually look at
 
04:43:53.708 --> 04:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
these you know realize what's going on
 
04:43:55.948 --> 04:43:55.958 align:start position:0%
but you know you can't force it but at
 
04:43:58.990 --> 04:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
least you have to get the consent and I
 
04:44:00.750 --> 04:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
think they also mail out all that stuff
 
04:44:03.788 --> 04:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the year and they
 
04:44:06.030 --> 04:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
don't uh I don't think parents pay that
 
04:44:08.270 --> 04:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
attention so I think this particular
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
thing should be sent separately through
 
04:44:14.110 --> 04:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
emails and it is true a lot of people
 
04:44:17.070 --> 04:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
don't open emails anymore so even then
 
04:44:18.910 --> 04:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
that might not work maybe they have to
 
04:44:21.270 --> 04:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
mail it I don't know personally I don't
 
04:44:22.830 --> 04:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
think they should be wasting the time on
 
04:44:25.390 --> 04:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
it but parents need to get the full
 
04:44:27.788 --> 04:44:27.798 align:start position:0%
consent and actually see these forms and
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
if they okay them then that's that and
 
04:44:33.628 --> 04:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
and that's any questions representative
 
04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair thanks for
 
04:44:38.150 --> 04:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question you did I hear you
 
04:44:39.990 --> 04:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
correctly that it's your understanding
 
04:44:42.350 --> 04:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
that the notification is sent at the
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year to families
 
04:44:46.470 --> 04:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
through either a letter or a parent
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
portal or something of that nature it is
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding that there's a bunch of
 
04:44:53.110 --> 04:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
stuff sent early in the school year
 
04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
which you would expect and that this is
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
one of them um just in a flurry of
 
04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
papers and that's um and I don't think
 
04:45:04.070 --> 04:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
parents pay much attention to that I
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
could be wrong but I think something
 
04:45:08.948 --> 04:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
like this that ask all these nosy
 
04:45:11.910 --> 04:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
questions should be sent separate ly and
 
04:45:14.230 --> 04:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
actually get a respon and should be opt
 
04:45:17.230 --> 04:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
in that's another thing too this opt out
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
to me it just doesn't
 
04:45:24.628 --> 04:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
work representative
 
04:45:27.310 --> 04:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
wock thank you m chairman good to see
 
04:45:29.830 --> 04:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
you again Mr fman it's a pleasure um
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
just the one question repeatedly you
 
04:45:35.550 --> 04:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
kept on saying they they they they they
 
04:45:38.590 --> 04:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
who are they the administration and
 
04:45:41.590 --> 04:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
school board members who support
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
having more and more staff more and more
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
turning our schools into hospitals so
 
04:45:50.510 --> 04:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
specifically it's been
 
04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none
 
04:46:20.190 --> 04:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.948 --> 04:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
04:46:23.550 --> 04:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I'm Becky
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
Wilson from the New Hampshire school
 
04:46:27.310 --> 04:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
boards Association uh we are not taking
 
04:46:29.910 --> 04:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
a position on the underlying bill um I
 
04:46:32.830 --> 04:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
have not really um had time to really
 
04:46:35.470 --> 04:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
look at the full Amendment uh language I
 
04:46:38.470 --> 04:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
just was here to offer uh information
 
04:46:41.310 --> 04:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
regarding Uh current practices or answer
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
any questions if there are any about the
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard policy which is a required
 
04:46:47.548 --> 04:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
policy I for non-educational and
 
04:46:49.750 --> 04:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
non-academic questionnaire surveys and
 
04:46:53.590 --> 04:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
research um and also to just offer um
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
some additional resources to the
 
04:46:59.310 --> 04:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
committee regarding the yrbs uh New
 
04:47:00.670 --> 04:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association for
 
04:47:03.628 --> 04:47:03.638 align:start position:0%
a long time has had uh a resolution that
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
is affirmed annually by members um that
 
04:47:10.350 --> 04:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
opt in for um Ser for curriculum
 
04:47:13.150 --> 04:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
programs and this particular survey does
 
04:47:14.910 --> 04:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
create an additional burden on the
 
04:47:17.190 --> 04:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
district that's not to say that parents
 
04:47:19.350 --> 04:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
don't have the opportunity to opt out of
 
04:47:21.190 --> 04:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum or programs or surveys that
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
they don't feel um they would like their
 
04:47:25.548 --> 04:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
children to participate in if you do go
 
04:47:29.868 --> 04:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
to the DHHS uh yrbs website every single
 
04:47:32.590 --> 04:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
question for the survey is published on
 
04:47:34.830 --> 04:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
that website there's also a document as
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
well that looks at every single question
 
04:47:38.750 --> 04:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
and provides a rationale of why that
 
04:47:41.390 --> 04:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
question is being asked as well as lists
 
04:47:43.910 --> 04:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
um references for data that is
 
04:47:45.750 --> 04:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
supporting why the question is being
 
04:47:49.150 --> 04:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
asked um given that it's given twice in
 
04:47:51.628 --> 04:47:51.638 align:start position:0%
high school um I do believe that the
 
04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
majority of districts do post on their
 
04:47:55.948 --> 04:47:55.958 align:start position:0%
website or send home at the beginning of
 
04:47:57.628 --> 04:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
the year as part of the paperwork
 
04:47:59.750 --> 04:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
notification that the yrbs will be given
 
04:48:02.628 --> 04:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
out um during the I think even years
 
04:48:05.910 --> 04:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
where it's not part of the um procedure
 
04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
because it is only given every other
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
year um the middle school yrbs just to
 
04:48:12.830 --> 04:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
clarify is not funded by the state that
 
04:48:16.270 --> 04:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
is a locally funded uh yrbs assessment
 
04:48:18.030 --> 04:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if a district is
 
04:48:20.628 --> 04:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
deciding to administer the yrbs at the
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
middle school level that is a local
 
04:48:24.708 --> 04:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
decision that school boards have to vote
 
04:48:27.150 --> 04:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
on and support so there's opportunity
 
04:48:29.590 --> 04:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
there but that is not um the same as the
 
04:48:31.788 --> 04:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
high school yrbs requirement here in the
 
04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
state where the state is funding um in
 
04:48:36.990 --> 04:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the HHS to provide that
 
04:48:41.150 --> 04:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
that survey um and most School districts
 
04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
do share the results their local results
 
04:48:45.868 --> 04:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
of the yrbs at a school board meeting
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
when those results come out so that
 
04:48:50.510 --> 04:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
there is some um Community information
 
04:48:52.670 --> 04:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
regarding how that data is being used
 
04:48:55.070 --> 04:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
what it's being used for um as I think
 
04:48:56.788 --> 04:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
many of the previous speakers prior to
 
04:48:59.990 --> 04:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
me mentioned um it is not solely used by
 
04:49:02.590 --> 04:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
school districts per se um although it
 
04:49:04.390 --> 04:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
does sometimes work in conjunction with
 
04:49:06.948 --> 04:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
other Community Resources to provide
 
04:49:09.548 --> 04:49:09.558 align:start position:0%
access to needed supports for families
 
04:49:12.590 --> 04:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
and students across the community so um
 
04:49:16.948 --> 04:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
questions anybody have
 
04:49:23.510 --> 04:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Becky is
 
04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
there anybody else looking to testify on
 
04:49:25.520 --> 04:49:32.750 align:start position:0%
there anybody else looking to testify on
this

04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:42.910 --> 04:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:44.510 --> 04:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair I'm
 
04:49:46.830 --> 04:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards representing
 
04:49:49.708 --> 04:49:49.718 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 31 Auburn Chester
 
04:49:53.470 --> 04:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
candy and Deerfield um just wanted to um
 
04:49:57.628 --> 04:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
make one point as a a former certified
 
04:50:01.350 --> 04:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
information privacy professional and a
 
04:50:04.430 --> 04:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
10year active member in the uh uh
 
04:50:07.590 --> 04:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
International Association of privacy
 
04:50:10.390 --> 04:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
professionals I worked for quite a while
 
04:50:12.788 --> 04:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
in Corporate America and worked a lot
 
04:50:16.110 --> 04:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
with marketing people and uh in the
 
04:50:19.150 --> 04:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
commercial world it's considered highly
 
04:50:23.430 --> 04:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
unethical to do anything but uh require
 
04:50:26.430 --> 04:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
an opin to the collection of personal
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
data um opt out was always viewed
 
04:50:34.948 --> 04:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
as unethical and so I've been trying for
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
four or five years to switch the culture
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
of the legislature in the state from
 
04:50:45.628 --> 04:50:45.638 align:start position:0%
doing optins to excuse me doing opt outs
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
to optins because optin is the ethical
 
04:50:51.150 --> 04:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
way to behave and I wanted to make the
 
04:50:54.310 --> 04:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
point because the that issue came up and
 
04:50:56.708 --> 04:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
we have some new freshmen uh in the

Tuftonboro I am here to present um House
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 415 FN which is repealing
 
04:52:17.310 --> 04:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
RSA 1891 16-a because it is an unfunded
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
mandate so according to um the New
 
04:52:24.708 --> 04:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution part one article
 
04:52:27.270 --> 04:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
28a states that the states shall not
 
04:52:29.788 --> 04:52:29.798 align:start position:0%
mandate or assign any new expanded or
 
04:52:32.548 --> 04:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
modified programs or responsibilities to
 
04:52:34.750 --> 04:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
any political subdivision in such a way
 
04:52:37.310 --> 04:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
as to necessitate additional local
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
expenditures by the political
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
subdivision unless such programs or
 
04:52:43.510 --> 04:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are fully funded by the
 
04:52:46.030 --> 04:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
state or unless such programs or
 
04:52:47.830 --> 04:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are approved for
 
04:52:49.548 --> 04:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
funding by a vote of the local
 
04:52:51.708 --> 04:52:51.718 align:start position:0%
legislative body of the political
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
subdivision now this bill is relating
 
04:52:57.310 --> 04:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
specifically to menstrual Pro um
 
04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
supplying free menstrual products in
 
04:53:00.910 --> 04:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
restrooms I certainly don't have an
 
04:53:03.190 --> 04:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
issue with that my issue with this bill
 
04:53:06.510 --> 04:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
is the unfunded mandate portion of it so
 
04:53:10.868 --> 04:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
if you were possibly in looking to amend
 
04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
the current Statute in 18916 a ran
 
04:53:19.350 --> 04:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
numeral 1 um it says the school district
 
04:53:23.350 --> 04:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
shall you could strike that and create a
 
04:53:27.190 --> 04:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
May in there um if you go down further
 
04:53:29.150 --> 04:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
in the current statute to Roman numeral
 
04:53:31.830 --> 04:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
3 this is where the unfunded mandate is
 
04:53:34.628 --> 04:53:34.638 align:start position:0%
and it says the school district shall
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
bear the cost of supplying menstrual
 
04:53:40.628 --> 04:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
hygiene products um and then it goes on
 
04:53:43.990 --> 04:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
This was um the next sentence was added
 
04:53:48.030 --> 04:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
in to temper the first as I saw when I
 
04:53:49.948 --> 04:53:49.958 align:start position:0%
went back and looked at the original
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill from or on this
 
04:53:55.350 --> 04:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
statute from 2019 um and the second
 
04:53:57.150 --> 04:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
parts of the school district May seek
 
04:53:58.788 --> 04:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
grants or part so they have the
 
04:54:02.190 --> 04:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look for outside sources
 
04:54:05.270 --> 04:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
without um taxpayer funding
 
04:54:09.708 --> 04:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
specifically um I had one question from
 
04:54:12.430 --> 04:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
um the public I understand that there
 
04:54:15.910 --> 04:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
have been at least 3,000 online
 
04:54:20.230 --> 04:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
submissions regarding this bill um I
 
04:54:23.590 --> 04:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
have received very few comments
 
04:54:25.390 --> 04:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
addressed to me personally but one came
 
04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
up just the other day and it was a good
 
04:54:30.070 --> 04:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
question um because the woman who
 
04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
emailed me she was looking at the fiscal
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
note so first off I was impressed that
 
04:54:36.310 --> 04:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
someone from the public was reading the
 
04:54:39.788 --> 04:54:39.798 align:start position:0%
entire bill um but she was concerned
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
about the line and the fiscal note that
 
04:54:43.990 --> 04:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
says the to the extent school districts
 
04:54:47.190 --> 04:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
choose to stop providing such products
 
04:54:50.190 --> 04:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
um I really um doubt that school
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
districts would choose to stop doing
 
04:54:53.910 --> 04:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
that they're already paying for it right
 
04:54:56.910 --> 04:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
now um so my recommendation to her and
 
04:54:58.510 --> 04:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
when I responded to her email was that
 
04:55:00.750 --> 04:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
she check with the school board find out
 
04:55:02.270 --> 04:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
how they're funding it right now and
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
whether or not they would continue to
 
04:55:06.510 --> 04:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
choose to do so should this bill pass as
 
04:55:09.910 --> 04:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
written and I think that covers
 
04:55:11.750 --> 04:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
everything thing that I wanted to cover
 
04:55:13.750 --> 04:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
on this bill so if you have any
 
04:55:16.310 --> 04:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
questions again I'm specifically
 
04:55:17.910 --> 04:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
concerned that it's an an
 
04:55:20.830 --> 04:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional unfunded mandate the
 
04:55:24.310 --> 04:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
problem is not the products being
 
04:55:28.030 --> 04:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
supplied any questions representative
 
04:55:31.070 --> 04:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
dve thank you and thank you for taking
 
04:55:31.080 --> 04:55:32.150 align:start position:0%
dve thank you and thank you for taking
my

my
 
04:55:34.510 --> 04:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
question do you have an idea what a
 
04:55:38.110 --> 04:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal note would be if we had
 
04:55:42.670 --> 04:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
to pay for this no I do not okay you can
 
04:55:43.830 --> 04:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
do it in your
 
04:55:46.670 --> 04:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
time any other questions representative
 
04:55:49.270 --> 04:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
Bon uh thank you for taking my question
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
have you heard from any school districts
 
04:55:54.270 --> 04:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
um that are opposed to doing this or
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
have any problems with the
 
04:56:00.150 --> 04:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
law personally no um oh one other thing
 
04:56:03.830 --> 04:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
that I did want to point out is that
 
04:56:03.840 --> 04:56:06.470 align:start position:0%
that I did want to point out is that
in

04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:56:08.868 --> 04:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
2021 uh House Bill
 
04:56:11.868 --> 04:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
276 actually tried to make this bill
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
better by um in section Roman numeral 3
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
adding in accordance to with article 28a
 
04:56:20.708 --> 04:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Constitution the
 
04:56:24.590 --> 04:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
state shall not mandate it basically put
 
04:56:28.150 --> 04:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
article 28a into the current statute but
 
04:56:31.510 --> 04:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
that bill didn't pass the house
 
04:56:34.788 --> 04:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
so representative CK you very much Madam
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:56:38.910 --> 04:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
question um do you have any idea what
 
04:56:42.150 --> 04:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
the current cost is to any District no
 
04:56:45.030 --> 04:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
no I I would recommend to constituents
 
04:56:46.948 --> 04:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
that they find out I mean it's already
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
in the School District budget I doubt
 
04:56:50.150 --> 04:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's a line
 
04:56:54.430 --> 04:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
item okay and and prior to this bill um
 
04:56:56.548 --> 04:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
the original bill which which D also
 
04:56:58.070 --> 04:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
directed schools about where products
 
04:56:59.070 --> 04:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
were to be
 
04:57:02.230 --> 04:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
located was there uh any information
 
04:57:04.590 --> 04:57:04.600 align:start position:0%
that you were looking at that had to do
 
04:57:07.310 --> 04:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
anything to do with cost again I have no
 
04:57:08.590 --> 04:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
concerns other than the fact it's an
 
04:57:12.548 --> 04:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:12.558 --> 04:57:13.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:57:13.590 --> 04:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair and um I I
 
04:57:18.470 --> 04:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
do believe that representative Edwards
 
04:57:20.190 --> 04:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
has an answer to a question about the
 
04:57:22.270 --> 04:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
money yeah he's going to testify next oh
 
04:57:22.280 --> 04:57:25.910 align:start position:0%
money yeah he's going to testify next oh
thank

04:57:25.910 --> 04:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:29.430 --> 04:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Hall thank you madam
 
04:57:31.030 --> 04:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:57:33.190 --> 04:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other legislation
 
04:57:35.868 --> 04:57:35.878 align:start position:0%
all all categories that have unfunded
 
04:57:38.590 --> 04:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
mandates that are concern I'm just
 
04:57:40.430 --> 04:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
curious is this the only unfunded
 
04:57:43.750 --> 04:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
mandate out there that this became a Hot
 
04:57:46.430 --> 04:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
Topic I appreciate your question I
 
04:57:48.430 --> 04:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
highly doubt it's the only unfunded
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
mandate for some reason it's one that
 
04:57:54.788 --> 04:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
pops up quite regularly and it was my
 
04:57:57.190 --> 04:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
turn this
 
04:57:59.830 --> 04:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
year representative Murray thank you
 
04:58:01.230 --> 04:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
04:58:03.708 --> 04:58:03.718 align:start position:0%
question I'm rereading article 28a that
 
04:58:05.548 --> 04:58:05.558 align:start position:0%
you uh reference regarding unfunded
 
04:58:07.628 --> 04:58:07.638 align:start position:0%
mandates and one of the questions that I
 
04:58:12.110 --> 04:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
do have is whether or not um the
 
04:58:14.510 --> 04:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation is open to understanding
 
04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
that it is it's an either or for state
 
04:58:20.150 --> 04:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
or local municipalities to
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
fund um it says a vote of or a vote of
 
04:58:26.750 --> 04:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
the local legislative body or political
 
04:58:28.948 --> 04:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
subdivision so it doesn't require
 
04:58:30.830 --> 04:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily the
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
state it it puts the onus on either the
 
04:58:44.070 --> 04:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:47.190 --> 04:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
well if the state mandated
 
04:58:49.510 --> 04:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
this they didn't necessarily have to
 
04:58:51.510 --> 04:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
take a vote at the school board on
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
funding this or the town didn't not
 
04:58:55.070 --> 04:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to take a vote on
 
04:58:55.080 --> 04:58:56.310 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to take a vote on
funding

04:58:56.310 --> 04:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:59:01.030 --> 04:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
this oops sorry yes thank you so so my
 
04:59:04.470 --> 04:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
question though was it does say or it
 
04:59:07.390 --> 04:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
the local does it not yes but I would
 
04:59:09.110 --> 04:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
suggest that over the course of time
 
04:59:10.948 --> 04:59:10.958 align:start position:0%
this has been pointed out quite
 
04:59:14.230 --> 04:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
regularly as an unfunded
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
mandate representative Woodcock thank
 
04:59:18.548 --> 04:59:18.558 align:start position:0%

going to fall represent Hall's question
 
04:59:30.430 --> 04:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
but you must have seen my notes um this
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
is six
 
04:59:36.110 --> 04:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
years six years of unfunded mandates
 
04:59:37.868 --> 04:59:37.878 align:start position:0%
across this
 
04:59:41.190 --> 04:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
legislature and you this one one bill
 
04:59:44.670 --> 04:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
comes out I'm amazed how that could
 
04:59:47.590 --> 04:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
happen I don't know it's just one of
 
04:59:49.470 --> 04:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
those that keeps popping up there are
 
04:59:51.310 --> 04:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
have been multiple attempts to correct
 
04:59:54.150 --> 04:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
it make it better and um in fact that's
 
04:59:57.270 --> 04:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
how I got into this I saw an attempt to
 
04:59:59.390 --> 04:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
um make it better
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
and the conversation ensued and here I
 
05:00:07.150 --> 05:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:11.390 --> 05:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
you any other questions
 
05:00:13.670 --> 05:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%

Edwards uh thank you madam chair I'm

representing Jess Edwards representing
 
05:00:32.510 --> 05:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
um Rockingham District 31 Auburn Candia
 
05:00:35.910 --> 05:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
Chester and Deerfield um I'm I'm here
 
05:00:39.990 --> 05:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
today uh as a co-sponsor of this bill uh
 
05:00:42.470 --> 05:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
initially uh I was sponsoring my own
 
05:00:46.270 --> 05:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
bill uh and I pulled it when I I found
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
out that this one was going forward uh
 
05:00:53.070 --> 05:00:53.080 align:start position:0%
why was I sponsoring my bill well I go
 
05:00:56.590 --> 05:00:56.600 align:start position:0%
to my school board periodically before
 
05:01:00.788 --> 05:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
bills are due and I say I'm here to help
 
05:01:02.470 --> 05:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
what would you like me to do to make
 
05:01:05.270 --> 05:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
things better and this time around they
 
05:01:09.190 --> 05:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
gave me uh four action items we talked
 
05:01:10.910 --> 05:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
about one of them them just being
 
05:01:13.788 --> 05:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
impractical so they dropped it they gave
 
05:01:17.350 --> 05:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
me three others and this was one of them
 
05:01:20.510 --> 05:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh principal Lori Collins wanted to be
 
05:01:23.470 --> 05:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
here today to tell you directly her
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
request to remove this requirement from
 
05:01:30.750 --> 05:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
law she said that in all her years as an
 
05:01:33.230 --> 05:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
educator this was never an issue would
 
05:01:36.910 --> 05:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
never be an issue and that uh it's
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
offensive in a way to a expect people
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
that we entrust the education of our Ed
 
05:01:47.430 --> 05:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
the education of our children to to be
 
05:01:51.670 --> 05:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
too stupid to understand that our kids
 
05:01:55.030 --> 05:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
need this service in the schools and in
 
05:01:56.590 --> 05:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
fact this service has been in the
 
05:01:59.150 --> 05:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
schools for probably as long as there's
 
05:02:01.868 --> 05:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
been commercial feminine hygiene
 
05:02:06.070 --> 05:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
products so um she did testify on a
 
05:02:08.830 --> 05:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
similar Bill last term and made the
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
request to remove this as a a compliance
 
05:02:17.548 --> 05:02:17.558 align:start position:0%
issue um it actually passed the
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
education committee passed the house
 
05:02:22.548 --> 05:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
went over to the senate senate committee
 
05:02:24.270 --> 05:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
killed it thought we were going to get
 
05:02:27.190 --> 05:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
it passed so the the reason this keeps
 
05:02:31.230 --> 05:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
coming up is because when it went into
 
05:02:34.628 --> 05:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
law uh it seemed to
 
05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
intentionally want to stick its finger
 
05:02:40.230 --> 05:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
in the eye of the New Hampshire con
 
05:02:42.830 --> 05:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution you you you can't read it
 
05:02:46.590 --> 05:02:46.600 align:start position:0%
any more clear that the school district
 
05:02:49.948 --> 05:02:49.958 align:start position:0%
shall bear the cost of supplying the
 
05:02:52.708 --> 05:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
products uh that's both in one short
 
05:02:57.150 --> 05:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
sentence a mandate from the state and in
 
05:03:00.030 --> 05:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
the same sentence a Prohibition of the
 
05:03:02.628 --> 05:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
state paying for it this is just
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
offensive and all of us have taken an
 
05:03:07.830 --> 05:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
oath to defend the New Hampshire
 
05:03:09.948 --> 05:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
Constitution so this is actually a very
 
05:03:13.030 --> 05:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
simple bill for us to fix it shouldn't
 
05:03:15.190 --> 05:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
have to come up every year should have
 
05:03:18.310 --> 05:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
been taken care of a long time ago now
 
05:03:20.670 --> 05:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of ways as the
 
05:03:24.110 --> 05:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
previous Bill sponsor said to fix this
 
05:03:27.190 --> 05:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
is to remove the mandate to say may
 
05:03:30.430 --> 05:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
instead of shall provide or just strike
 
05:03:32.270 --> 05:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
this sentence because this sentence is
 
05:03:34.788 --> 05:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
offensive the school district shall bear
 
05:03:37.830 --> 05:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
the cost of supplying menstrual hygiene
 
05:03:40.750 --> 05:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
products um
 
05:03:45.070 --> 05:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
in I I have previously submitted a bill
 
05:03:46.910 --> 05:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
back to the cost issue I've submitted a
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
bill in Prior terms to actually have the
 
05:03:51.948 --> 05:03:51.958 align:start position:0%
state pay for it because this is this is
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
a good thing to have for our girls
 
05:03:56.670 --> 05:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
perfectly great thing to have but if
 
05:03:59.070 --> 05:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a mandate we have an
 
05:04:02.470 --> 05:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
obligation a duty to pay for it so um
 
05:04:05.708 --> 05:04:05.718 align:start position:0%
there was a fiscal note on that bill and
 
05:04:06.990 --> 05:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
I think for the
 
05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
entire Bill I'm going for memory um it
 
05:04:11.750 --> 05:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
was about
 
05:04:15.750 --> 05:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
$550,000 a year for the state um that's
 
05:04:17.708 --> 05:04:17.718 align:start position:0%
in the historical record we could pull
 
05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
it up we can see what the old fiscal
 
05:04:22.990 --> 05:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
note was so
 
05:04:25.670 --> 05:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
um I think the time has come is just to
 
05:04:27.788 --> 05:04:27.798 align:start position:0%
clean this up uh do something
 
05:04:29.670 --> 05:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate with it get the unfunded
 
05:04:32.430 --> 05:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
mandate out of there and let's let's
 
05:04:34.230 --> 05:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
let's do this let's agree that there are
 
05:04:36.750 --> 05:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
other unfunded mandates and let's make
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
it a passion of ours to get rid of all
 
05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
of them you can do that one step at a
 
05:04:44.190 --> 05:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
time this step is teed up for this
 
05:04:46.190 --> 05:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee to just knock it out of the
 
05:04:49.030 --> 05:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
park clean it up and then identify the
 
05:04:51.948 --> 05:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
next one and we'll fix it too um that's
 
05:04:54.190 --> 05:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
it if I'll take questions if there are
 
05:04:57.990 --> 05:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
any any questions representative
 
05:05:02.310 --> 05:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
wock Madam chair um see represent the
 
05:05:04.190 --> 05:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
first question who is the administrator
 
05:05:07.390 --> 05:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
you were quoting initially what school
 
05:05:09.708 --> 05:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
uh the Auburn Village School and Auburn
 
05:05:13.670 --> 05:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the principal was uh is
 
05:05:17.708 --> 05:05:17.718 align:start position:0%
still uh Lori Collins uh she made the
 
05:05:19.788 --> 05:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
request in the presence of the entire
 
05:05:21.910 --> 05:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
School Board it was a a school board
 
05:05:24.430 --> 05:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
meeting and I just could know what
 
05:05:25.670 --> 05:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
school that was what was the grade level
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
on that school that is uh K through 8
 
05:05:32.830 --> 05:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
okay may I follow my main question sure
 
05:05:34.788 --> 05:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that information
 
05:05:37.350 --> 05:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
um you made you made the statement that
 
05:05:39.270 --> 05:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of that was like we
 
05:05:40.830 --> 05:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
just I think you said stick a finger in
 
05:05:42.110 --> 05:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
the eye of the New Hampshire
 
05:05:45.190 --> 05:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution yes that's my perception of
 
05:05:47.670 --> 05:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
why that sentence was crafted so
 
05:05:50.990 --> 05:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
specifically that in only a tiny little
 
05:05:53.788 --> 05:05:53.798 align:start position:0%
sentence both establish a mandate and
 
05:05:55.430 --> 05:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
say we're not going to pay for it so
 
05:05:56.430 --> 05:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
you're you're not I just want to be
 
05:05:57.910 --> 05:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
clear on this you're not referring to
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
the intent of the
 
05:06:02.830 --> 05:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
bill rather the funding of the bill want
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
to mix those two I'm I'm a finance guy
 
05:06:07.548 --> 05:06:07.558 align:start position:0%
I'm a constitutional guy I I'm I'm
 
05:06:09.948 --> 05:06:09.958 align:start position:0%
dealing and I'm also a healthcare guy so
 
05:06:11.948 --> 05:06:11.958 align:start position:0%
the the the purpose of providing the
 
05:06:16.030 --> 05:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
products is absolutely legit it's been
 
05:06:18.628 --> 05:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
legit for as long as we've had girls
 
05:06:21.948 --> 05:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
going to Public Schools the issue to me
 
05:06:24.548 --> 05:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
is a constitutional one this is just a
 
05:06:26.708 --> 05:06:26.718 align:start position:0%
clear violation that makes no sense for
 
05:06:30.110 --> 05:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
us to leave it so obvious and a finance
 
05:06:32.548 --> 05:06:32.558 align:start position:0%
one somebody's going to pay for it okay
 
05:06:35.350 --> 05:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
I thank you I just just commentary I
 
05:06:36.350 --> 05:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we weren't
 
05:06:38.270 --> 05:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
talking about the intent of the bill and
 
05:06:40.750 --> 05:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
not rather the funding of the bill
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
I'm only talking about the funding okay
 
05:06:44.190 --> 05:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
thank thanks much yes
 
05:06:46.948 --> 05:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
sir any other questions I I just want to
 
05:06:49.470 --> 05:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
say again because I've testified on a
 
05:06:51.948 --> 05:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
similar Bill like this in the past and
 
05:06:54.910 --> 05:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
it's like the opposition can't hear me
 
05:06:59.030 --> 05:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
they keep pretending or or reacting to
 
05:07:00.990 --> 05:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that I may be talking about the
 
05:07:04.430 --> 05:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
product itself I'm not this is purely a
 
05:07:06.830 --> 05:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue let's clean up the
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
language of the bill
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:50.190 --> 05:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
hi members of the committee my name is
 
05:07:51.788 --> 05:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
Devin Quinn I'm from the New Hampshire
 
05:07:54.270 --> 05:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
women's Foundation um we are opposed to
 
05:07:58.708 --> 05:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
this bill um I want to start off with a
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of background I know that
 
05:08:01.750 --> 05:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards just gave that
 
05:08:03.750 --> 05:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
but I'll add a little bit more um I know
 
05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
many of you have heard this before so um
 
05:08:07.390 --> 05:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
bear with me for the record or for any
 
05:08:09.030 --> 05:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
of you who are new um and then I want to
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
just go over for a couple of things and
 
05:08:12.310 --> 05:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
um for those who couldn't be here who
 
05:08:13.948 --> 05:08:13.958 align:start position:0%
I'm passing around letters I wanted to
 
05:08:15.948 --> 05:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
pull out a one line or two but I'll try
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
to be as quick as
 
05:08:20.868 --> 05:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
possible um this bill first came up in
 
05:08:24.310 --> 05:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
2019 um it was the idea of um a young
 
05:08:25.868 --> 05:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
woman in high school in Rochester
 
05:08:27.990 --> 05:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
Caroline Dylan she worked with then
 
05:08:30.190 --> 05:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Martha Hennessy uh to come up
 
05:08:34.990 --> 05:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
with this bill um it was um a really uh
 
05:08:36.350 --> 05:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful moment for New Hampshire it
 
05:08:39.430 --> 05:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
was covered in a lot of um papers um
 
05:08:41.510 --> 05:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
talking about Caroline's advocacy and
 
05:08:43.830 --> 05:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
bravery to talk about um what is
 
05:08:47.070 --> 05:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
considered a very stigmatized um uh
 
05:08:48.670 --> 05:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
thing talking about ministration and
 
05:08:51.548 --> 05:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
periods um it can feel stigmatized for
 
05:08:53.548 --> 05:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
adults to talk about it so it's a really
 
05:08:55.030 --> 05:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
big deal as you can imagine for a
 
05:08:57.868 --> 05:08:57.878 align:start position:0%
student to come to hearings and talk to
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
legislators about it um when Governor
 
05:09:03.830 --> 05:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
sonunu signed that bill in 2019 he said
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation is about equality and
 
05:09:08.548 --> 05:09:08.558 align:start position:0%
dignity sb42 will help ensure young
 
05:09:09.990 --> 05:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
women in New Hampshire Public Schools
 
05:09:11.788 --> 05:09:11.798 align:start position:0%
will have the freedom to learn without
 
05:09:14.708 --> 05:09:14.718 align:start position:0%
disruption and free of shame or fear of
 
05:09:17.868 --> 05:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
stigma um since then about half of all
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
states have passed similar bills um
 
05:09:23.110 --> 05:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
including Virginia in 2020 and Alabama
 
05:09:24.510 --> 05:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
and Utah in
 
05:09:28.628 --> 05:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
2022 um no states have repealed uh their
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
bill um and in a recent 2024 poll 77% of
 
05:09:35.430 --> 05:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
people agree that menal products should
 
05:09:39.070 --> 05:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
be supplied in in schools um as was
 
05:09:41.548 --> 05:09:41.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned men over 1,400 people signed
 
05:09:43.910 --> 05:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
in um in opposition to this bill which
 
05:09:47.830 --> 05:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
is um notable for me I believe in a bill
 
05:09:51.030 --> 05:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
like this um and I just wanted to go
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
over some of the issues we hear um every
 
05:09:57.510 --> 05:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
year in attempts to repeal or water down
 
05:10:02.510 --> 05:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
this bill um uh and particularly um from
 
05:10:05.708 --> 05:10:05.718 align:start position:0%
students we've heard um last last B we
 
05:10:08.030 --> 05:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
heard from Alex uh can um and you're
 
05:10:10.310 --> 05:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
going to hear from Abby today so um this
 
05:10:12.270 --> 05:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
is most meaningful when students show up
 
05:10:14.788 --> 05:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
something they care about a lot um some
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
arguments that we have heard and you've
 
05:10:18.390 --> 05:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
already heard of that it's too expensive
 
05:10:21.270 --> 05:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
for schools I certainly understand that
 
05:10:23.948 --> 05:10:23.958 align:start position:0%
um schools have a tough time paying for
 
05:10:27.070 --> 05:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
everything that that certainly is um uh
 
05:10:28.548 --> 05:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
I feel for schools trying to make it all
 
05:10:31.430 --> 05:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
work um but I have a letter that I've
 
05:10:34.948 --> 05:10:34.958 align:start position:0%
passed around here from um a retired
 
05:10:37.030 --> 05:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
dean of students from pingr Academy
 
05:10:40.270 --> 05:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
which for this um law public school um
 
05:10:42.390 --> 05:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
Sue tardella says as a former New
 
05:10:43.708 --> 05:10:43.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire administrator I wish to
 
05:10:46.270 --> 05:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
express my concerns regarding hb14 and
 
05:10:47.830 --> 05:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
releasing public middle and high schools
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
from providing menstrual products in
 
05:10:52.110 --> 05:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
girls and gender neutral bathrooms and
 
05:10:54.590 --> 05:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
HB 415 presents a serious negative
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
consequences for young women in New
 
05:10:58.750 --> 05:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire schools um about the financial
 
05:11:00.470 --> 05:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
burden she says State leaders supporting
 
05:11:02.750 --> 05:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
415 argue that this provision places a
 
05:11:04.830 --> 05:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
financial burden on school districts as
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
a former High School administrator
 
05:11:08.230 --> 05:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
administrator I found the implementation
 
05:11:09.788 --> 05:11:09.798 align:start position:0%
of the law to be seamless
 
05:11:11.430 --> 05:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
I added the purchase of menal hygiene
 
05:11:13.190 --> 05:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
products to my school's operating budget
 
05:11:15.390 --> 05:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
along with toilet paper tissues hand
 
05:11:17.868 --> 05:11:17.878 align:start position:0%
sanitizer Etc and menal products became
 
05:11:19.270 --> 05:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
a routine part of the school's annual
 
05:11:21.470 --> 05:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
supplies order continued support for the
 
05:11:22.868 --> 05:11:22.878 align:start position:0%
law insures all students have equal
 
05:11:25.310 --> 05:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
access to essential uh hygiene supplies
 
05:11:26.708 --> 05:11:26.718 align:start position:0%
which can reduce miss school time while
 
05:11:28.788 --> 05:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
improving overall well-being and
 
05:11:32.510 --> 05:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
security um we've also heard in the past
 
05:11:36.390 --> 05:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
um some ways to make um it optional um
 
05:11:38.750 --> 05:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
or the words may but that is effectively
 
05:11:42.030 --> 05:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
a repeat to be clear um and would be the
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
same as of course it was optional to do
 
05:11:47.430 --> 05:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
before 2019 so it's effectively a repeal
 
05:11:51.548 --> 05:11:51.558 align:start position:0%
um some folks have uh promoted a change
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
to uh offering it in School nurses um
 
05:11:58.150 --> 05:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
offices um to cut down on cost and you
 
05:11:59.548 --> 05:11:59.558 align:start position:0%
know my thinking is that if you're
 
05:12:00.990 --> 05:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
cutting down on costs because it's in
 
05:12:03.868 --> 05:12:03.878 align:start position:0%
School nurses um then that's because
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
they're giving out fewer products
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
because it's less accessible defeating
 
05:12:09.190 --> 05:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
the purpose of it um specifically
 
05:12:12.270 --> 05:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
another letter I gave to you all is from
 
05:12:13.948 --> 05:12:13.958 align:start position:0%
uh the Executive Board of the New
 
05:12:16.470 --> 05:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school Nurses Association uh
 
05:12:18.750 --> 05:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
they are opposed to this bill uh and
 
05:12:20.470 --> 05:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
they say prior to the law being passed
 
05:12:22.990 --> 05:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
in 2019 many School nurses were already
 
05:12:24.750 --> 05:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
placing hygiene products in bathrooms in
 
05:12:27.150 --> 05:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
many schools we were pleased the 2019
 
05:12:29.150 --> 05:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
law took action to spread the best best
 
05:12:32.708 --> 05:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
practices to all schools um showing that
 
05:12:34.910 --> 05:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
even the School nurses are showing that
 
05:12:36.628 --> 05:12:36.638 align:start position:0%
the best practice is to have it where
 
05:12:39.868 --> 05:12:39.878 align:start position:0%
students need it um
 
05:12:41.230 --> 05:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
they also said teachers were pleased
 
05:12:43.190 --> 05:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
that the implementation meant less
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
lessened Miss class time when menting
 
05:12:46.868 --> 05:12:46.878 align:start position:0%
students head supplies closer to their
 
05:12:48.750 --> 05:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
classroom as you can imagine this is
 
05:12:51.350 --> 05:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
about school time and learning um and if
 
05:12:54.270 --> 05:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
you can imagine being a girl in middle
 
05:12:56.190 --> 05:12:56.200 align:start position:0%
school or high school and leaving math
 
05:12:58.270 --> 05:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
class to go to the bathroom your teacher
 
05:13:00.548 --> 05:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
expects you back in a few minutes time
 
05:13:02.470 --> 05:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
but if you have to go to the
 
05:13:06.788 --> 05:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
bathroom um need a uh mental product and
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
we all know that if you've uh had a PE
 
05:13:10.830 --> 05:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
period you've been surprised by a period
 
05:13:13.510 --> 05:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
in your life uh and if you have to then
 
05:13:15.750 --> 05:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
go to the school nurse's office which is
 
05:13:17.830 --> 05:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
um a place you have to publicly out loud
 
05:13:19.628 --> 05:13:19.638 align:start position:0%
say what you need that's a good reason
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
not to go come back to your to the
 
05:13:24.270 --> 05:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
bathroom then return back to class
 
05:13:25.590 --> 05:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's a long amount of time you're
 
05:13:27.708 --> 05:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
missing school this is interrupting
 
05:13:30.430 --> 05:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
School instruction um and your teacher
 
05:13:31.910 --> 05:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
might ask you why you've been gone so
 
05:13:34.110 --> 05:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
long um these are really uncomfortable
 
05:13:36.110 --> 05:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
things um that we can really avoid by
 
05:13:39.670 --> 05:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
keeping this lot in place um lastly
 
05:13:42.590 --> 05:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
there have been uh concerns about misuse
 
05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
um students um uh you know playing with
 
05:13:49.628 --> 05:13:49.638 align:start position:0%
these products or um shoving them in
 
05:13:51.390 --> 05:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
toilets and the School nurses talk about
 
05:13:53.910 --> 05:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
this as well um they say while the issue
 
05:13:55.670 --> 05:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
of vandalism at first was an issue in
 
05:13:57.548 --> 05:13:57.558 align:start position:0%
Middle Schools it did calm down
 
05:13:59.390 --> 05:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
misbehavior in a bathroom is not a new
 
05:14:01.310 --> 05:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
issue in middle schools for example if a
 
05:14:03.750 --> 05:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
student clogs a toilet with paper towels
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
we do not take paper towels away we
 
05:14:07.150 --> 05:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
address the behavior we've heard
 
05:14:09.670 --> 05:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
multiple examples of if a student throws
 
05:14:12.110 --> 05:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
food in a cafeteria do you take away
 
05:14:14.750 --> 05:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
food for the whole school no uh it's not
 
05:14:17.190 --> 05:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
a supply issue it's a behavior issue and
 
05:14:21.510 --> 05:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
I feel for administrators and uh um
 
05:14:22.990 --> 05:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
teachers trying to deal with all these
 
05:14:26.708 --> 05:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
issues but this isn't a supply issue
 
05:14:30.430 --> 05:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
um finally I just want to close with
 
05:14:33.430 --> 05:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
another um voice of a student um who
 
05:14:36.110 --> 05:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
could not be here her name is Hannah um
 
05:14:37.910 --> 05:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
and she attended lonia High School from
 
05:14:40.670 --> 05:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
2018 to 202 22 you have this letter as
 
05:14:42.990 --> 05:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
well she says it's important to uh to
 
05:14:44.548 --> 05:14:44.558 align:start position:0%
have accessible menal products in New
 
05:14:45.788 --> 05:14:45.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire middle and high schools
 
05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
because it helps build a safe and
 
05:14:49.350 --> 05:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable environment for students
 
05:14:51.070 --> 05:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
having products in bathrooms makes it
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
easily available to everyone who needs
 
05:14:55.110 --> 05:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
it without singling students out uh
 
05:14:56.750 --> 05:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
while I know how to work to destigmatize
 
05:14:58.350 --> 05:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
the conversation around periods and know
 
05:15:00.150 --> 05:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
it's nothing to be ashamed of because
 
05:15:01.948 --> 05:15:01.958 align:start position:0%
it's a natural bodily function middle
 
05:15:03.548 --> 05:15:03.558 align:start position:0%
and high schoolers do feel ashamed of
 
05:15:05.510 --> 05:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
needing menstrual products having to go
 
05:15:08.310 --> 05:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
to the nurse can be uh embarrassing and
 
05:15:10.270 --> 05:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
turn students away from asking for help
 
05:15:12.670 --> 05:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
which only ends up harming them uh
 
05:15:14.270 --> 05:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
females at any age should not be ashamed
 
05:15:16.430 --> 05:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
of needing basic hygiene products um and
 
05:15:17.628 --> 05:15:17.638 align:start position:0%
that's what we are taught from a young
 
05:15:17.638 --> 05:15:19.390 align:start position:0%
that's what we are taught from a young
age

05:15:19.390 --> 05:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
age
 
05:15:21.628 --> 05:15:21.638 align:start position:0%
um and menal products need to be
 
05:15:23.190 --> 05:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
discussed and accessible to everyone so
 
05:15:25.510 --> 05:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
I wanted to add her voice as well uh I'm
 
05:15:27.190 --> 05:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions any
 
05:15:29.230 --> 05:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative cig thank you
 
05:15:31.548 --> 05:15:31.558 align:start position:0%
so much um Miss Quinn I know that the
 
05:15:33.548 --> 05:15:33.558 align:start position:0%
women's Foundation has done work looking
 
05:15:36.670 --> 05:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
at poverty as it impacts um girls in
 
05:15:39.190 --> 05:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
particular across the state what's the
 
05:15:42.310 --> 05:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
impact of poverty on menring girls in
 
05:15:43.948 --> 05:15:43.958 align:start position:0%
schools and how does that impact their
 
05:15:46.390 --> 05:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
ability to be successful thanks for the
 
05:15:50.070 --> 05:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
question so um we know that girls who or
 
05:15:51.590 --> 05:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
young women who don't have access to
 
05:15:54.110 --> 05:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
menual hygiene products um at home to
 
05:15:56.670 --> 05:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
bring to school with them um they often
 
05:15:58.150 --> 05:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
choose not to go to school they'll skip
 
05:16:00.788 --> 05:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
school they'll skip class um that could
 
05:16:03.750 --> 05:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
be days of school missed or um periods
 
05:16:07.230 --> 05:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
of time um we know that not all students
 
05:16:09.150 --> 05:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
have friends that they can ask for
 
05:16:12.070 --> 05:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
products um this is about Miss class
 
05:16:15.390 --> 05:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
time and um someone also at one point
 
05:16:17.510 --> 05:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
said uh students might be stealing these
 
05:16:19.350 --> 05:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
products and I would say that you you
 
05:16:21.990 --> 05:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
can't steal something that's free um and
 
05:16:24.670 --> 05:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
if you saw a student that was you know
 
05:16:26.430 --> 05:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
taking a roll of toilet paper and
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
putting in his bag to go home you know
 
05:16:30.788 --> 05:16:30.798 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't say he's stealing toilet
 
05:16:32.070 --> 05:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
paper You' say wow what's going on at
 
05:16:34.390 --> 05:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
home how come he doesn't have access to
 
05:16:37.750 --> 05:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
toilet paper so really we're if anyone
 
05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
is um needing menal products it's folks
 
05:16:43.510 --> 05:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
who don't have access to bring them into
 
05:16:45.830 --> 05:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
school themselves and also point out
 
05:16:48.430 --> 05:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
this might seem obvious to um those of
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
you uh who have ever menstruated but for
 
05:16:53.070 --> 05:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
those who haven't um products are very
 
05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
different um there are just like toilet
 
05:16:58.310 --> 05:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
paper or paper towels maybe at home you
 
05:17:00.310 --> 05:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
buy a nicer type of paper towel or
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
toilet paper schools obviously are
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
buying the cheaper versions of that
 
05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
they're also buying the cheaper versions
 
05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
of menal products so um girls and young
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
women aren't preferring to use those
 
05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
products if they have them on them they
 
05:17:14.830 --> 05:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
want to use their own products this is
 
05:17:17.948 --> 05:17:17.958 align:start position:0%
really about needing those products in
 
05:17:20.270 --> 05:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
those bathrooms at that
 
05:17:23.350 --> 05:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
moment thanks any other
 
05:17:26.270 --> 05:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thanks
 
05:17:28.230 --> 05:17:28.240 align:start position:0%

05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
time can't read
 
05:17:30.638 --> 05:17:34.548 align:start position:0%
time can't read

05:17:34.548 --> 05:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
burns Abby
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:50.510 --> 05:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh hello my name is Abigail banner and
 
05:17:54.030 --> 05:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
I'm in seventh grade I go to a private
 
05:17:57.150 --> 05:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
school and they do not provide menstrual
 
05:17:59.750 --> 05:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
products in my school I cannot carry a
 
05:18:02.990 --> 05:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
backpack or bag with me to my classes I
 
05:18:04.830 --> 05:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
keep supplies I need in my locker which
 
05:18:06.750 --> 05:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
is a long distance away from the
 
05:18:09.510 --> 05:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
bathrooms there is no way easily get a
 
05:18:13.628 --> 05:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
pad or tampon from my locker to the
 
05:18:16.430 --> 05:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
bathroom without a
 
05:18:18.868 --> 05:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
plan they aren't
 
05:18:21.070 --> 05:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
provided in the bathroom like I said
 
05:18:22.948 --> 05:18:22.958 align:start position:0%
before and my school monitors students
 
05:18:24.910 --> 05:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
outside the class very
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
closely keeping track of the time you
 
05:18:29.150 --> 05:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
spend outside of
 
05:18:32.868 --> 05:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
class uh they have cameras outside the
 
05:18:34.990 --> 05:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
bathrooms watching who goes in and who
 
05:18:37.948 --> 05:18:37.958 align:start position:0%
comes out it would be more convenient if
 
05:18:39.750 --> 05:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
they were already in there for me so I
 
05:18:42.750 --> 05:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
had what I needed when I needed
 
05:18:45.750 --> 05:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
them there was once this time when I had
 
05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
to use the bathroom just to find out
 
05:18:48.708 --> 05:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
that I started my
 
05:18:50.990 --> 05:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
cycle I didn't have much time but I
 
05:18:53.030 --> 05:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
thought through my options it was
 
05:18:54.948 --> 05:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
getting close to the end of class so I
 
05:18:57.230 --> 05:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
had about 3 minutes maximum to do
 
05:18:59.670 --> 05:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
something on one hand I could go down
 
05:19:01.670 --> 05:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
two flights of stairs to my locker grab
 
05:19:04.910 --> 05:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
a pad go back upstairs and use it which
 
05:19:07.910 --> 05:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
used more time than I had or I could use
 
05:19:09.510 --> 05:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
toilet paper and wait until lunch which
 
05:19:12.470 --> 05:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
was next block I chose the
 
05:19:16.070 --> 05:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
ladder after class was dismissed I went
 
05:19:18.270 --> 05:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
back to my locker I snuck a pad into my
 
05:19:20.750 --> 05:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
skirt pocket and made it beine for the
 
05:19:23.390 --> 05:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
cafeteria bathrooms it was a stressful
 
05:19:25.230 --> 05:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
moment and not the first time I'd use a
 
05:19:26.750 --> 05:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
substitute for a
 
05:19:29.150 --> 05:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
pad my school doesn't have a full-time
 
05:19:31.628 --> 05:19:31.638 align:start position:0%
nurse our equivalent is the front desk
 
05:19:33.430 --> 05:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
which has its own specific pass and is
 
05:19:34.948 --> 05:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
located in a different section of the
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
school building making it a hassle to go
 
05:19:37.320 --> 05:19:38.868 align:start position:0%
school building making it a hassle to go
to

05:19:38.868 --> 05:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:19:40.670 --> 05:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
I could ask my friends for help but
 
05:19:42.390 --> 05:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
since there's so much taboo and shame
 
05:19:43.990 --> 05:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to talking about periods
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
openly it would require a well an entire
 
05:19:48.670 --> 05:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
wellth thought out plan to not get
 
05:19:51.030 --> 05:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
caught by a suspicious
 
05:19:53.548 --> 05:19:53.558 align:start position:0%
teacher the repeal of this bill might
 
05:19:55.548 --> 05:19:55.558 align:start position:0%
not affect me the same way as my public
 
05:19:57.510 --> 05:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
school peers but I do know what it would
 
05:19:59.750 --> 05:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
be like for
 
05:20:02.470 --> 05:20:02.480 align:start position:0%

households I'm here today to testify an
 
05:22:06.310 --> 05:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 415 which would
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
remove requirements that schools provide
 
05:22:10.470 --> 05:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
menstrual products as you
 
05:22:14.030 --> 05:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
know period poverty impacts many of the
 
05:22:16.948 --> 05:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
girls and families that we serve we have
 
05:22:18.830 --> 05:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
a partnership with United Way of Greater
 
05:22:21.590 --> 05:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
NASA whereby we have a period Pantry
 
05:22:24.190 --> 05:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
known as Rosy's Pantry in our NASA
 
05:22:26.390 --> 05:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
Center that supplies free feminine
 
05:22:29.708 --> 05:22:29.718 align:start position:0%
products to our girls their families and
 
05:22:30.868 --> 05:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:22:33.830 --> 05:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
community we restock this Pantry daily
 
05:22:35.628 --> 05:22:35.638 align:start position:0%
it's actually um something that our
 
05:22:38.590 --> 05:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
older girls enjoy doing it's it we go
 
05:22:40.868 --> 05:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
through many products every single day
 
05:22:43.788 --> 05:22:43.798 align:start position:0%
um that they use and many other people
 
05:22:45.750 --> 05:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
um it's often a matter of not being able
 
05:22:49.750 --> 05:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
to afford these products it costs on
 
05:22:51.868 --> 05:22:51.878 align:start position:0%
average I just looked online from
 
05:22:56.350 --> 05:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
Walmart to other places it's um8 to2 per
 
05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
box of tampons or pads so it's expensive
 
05:23:01.590 --> 05:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
especially with a family that has
 
05:23:01.600 --> 05:23:02.548 align:start position:0%
especially with a family that has
several

05:23:02.548 --> 05:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
several
 
05:23:05.230 --> 05:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
girls this impacts a girl's emotional
 
05:23:06.990 --> 05:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
well-being to not be able to afford
 
05:23:09.948 --> 05:23:09.958 align:start position:0%
these products and it does impact their
 
05:23:12.190 --> 05:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
education many girls especially the
 
05:23:14.628 --> 05:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
younger girls as was mentioned are just
 
05:23:16.990 --> 05:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
too embarrassed to head to the school
 
05:23:19.708 --> 05:23:19.718 align:start position:0%
nurse and they're mortified if they have
 
05:23:21.750 --> 05:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
an accident at school that's happened to
 
05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
my daughters it's happened to me I'm
 
05:23:24.868 --> 05:23:24.878 align:start position:0%
sure it's happened to almost every
 
05:23:27.868 --> 05:23:27.878 align:start position:0%
female in this room having products
 
05:23:30.430 --> 05:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
available at no charge in school
 
05:23:33.230 --> 05:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
bathrooms can help ease this hardship
 
05:23:35.350 --> 05:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire girls especially lower
 
05:23:38.030 --> 05:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
income girls and all girls who might not
 
05:23:40.310 --> 05:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
have the products they need at that time
 
05:23:42.990 --> 05:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
based on Girls Inc National research one
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
in four teens have missed class time due
 
05:23:48.990 --> 05:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
to lack of access to menstrual hygiene
 
05:23:51.470 --> 05:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
products and our goal is to try to keep
 
05:23:54.590 --> 05:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
kids in the classroom one in five teens
 
05:23:57.390 --> 05:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
have struggled to afford period products
 
05:23:59.190 --> 05:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
or have not been able to purchase them
 
05:24:03.070 --> 05:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
at all and in 2019 when Governor suu
 
05:24:04.788 --> 05:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
signed Senate Bill
 
05:24:07.590 --> 05:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
142 requiring schools to provide these
 
05:24:09.070 --> 05:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
free products
 
05:24:11.390 --> 05:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
um it was mentioned earlier but the goal
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
was to achieve equality and
 
05:24:16.830 --> 05:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
dignity House Bill 4115 would reverse
 
05:24:19.510 --> 05:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
that goal so on behalf of Girls Inc of
 
05:24:21.708 --> 05:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we respectfully ask the
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee to consider voting inexpedient
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
to legislate on House Bill 415 in order
 
05:24:29.470 --> 05:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
to continue to provide the girls of the
 
05:24:31.390 --> 05:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
state with the access to free menstrual
 
05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
hygiene products that they may urgently
 
05:24:36.548 --> 05:24:36.558 align:start position:0%
need to get through their school day
 
05:24:38.030 --> 05:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to answer any
 
05:24:38.040 --> 05:24:39.190 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to answer any
questions

05:24:39.190 --> 05:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative drive thank you and thank
 
05:24:45.948 --> 05:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question U if this is
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
going on now where it's mandated but not
 
05:24:51.430 --> 05:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
funded by the state but it is a
 
05:24:51.440 --> 05:24:53.750 align:start position:0%
funded by the state but it is a
successful

05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
successful
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:03.990 --> 05:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
going wouldn't schools if it wasn't a
 
05:25:06.788 --> 05:25:06.798 align:start position:0%
law wouldn't many schools just opt to no
 
05:25:09.070 --> 05:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
longer do it and then have the risk of
 
05:25:11.670 --> 05:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
girls needing products not having them
 
05:25:14.110 --> 05:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
and then not going to
 
05:25:16.548 --> 05:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
school I I hope I'm understanding your
 
05:25:18.948 --> 05:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
question properly thank you I think
 
05:25:20.430 --> 05:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
we're we're understand each other
 
05:25:23.070 --> 05:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
slightly um but I guess my question is
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
they are doing it now they're not being
 
05:25:26.548 --> 05:25:26.558 align:start position:0%
funded why would they not do it when
 
05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
they're not being funded and there's no
 
05:25:31.590 --> 05:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
law I think they've realized maybe we've
 
05:25:33.390 --> 05:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
how good it is absolutely yes why not
 
05:25:36.110 --> 05:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
just continue the way that we're going
 
05:25:36.120 --> 05:25:39.230 align:start position:0%
just continue the way that we're going
exactly

05:25:39.230 --> 05:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:41.830 --> 05:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
but without having an unfunded mandate
 
05:25:44.470 --> 05:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
behind it it seems like something that's
 
05:25:47.788 --> 05:25:47.798 align:start position:0%
been in place for quite some time and is
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's been an accepted policy
 
05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
with probably very few exceptions in
 
05:25:56.670 --> 05:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
schools because it's a needed way for
 
05:25:58.430 --> 05:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
girls to be able to get through the day
 
05:26:01.270 --> 05:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
if they need those products I I I do not
 
05:26:04.948 --> 05:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
have the cost of what it is for a school
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
but I can't imagine that it is blowing
 
05:26:11.430 --> 05:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
away their expense
 
05:26:14.350 --> 05:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
line representative muray thank you
 
05:26:15.788 --> 05:26:15.798 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:26:17.868 --> 05:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
question I forgive me and it may not
 
05:26:20.548 --> 05:26:20.558 align:start position:0%
have been you but wasn't there just
 
05:26:22.750 --> 05:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
testimony regarding the fact that um
 
05:26:24.548 --> 05:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
supplies just like many other school
 
05:26:26.270 --> 05:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
supplies was worked into an operating
 
05:26:29.350 --> 05:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
budget um in many times and so they are
 
05:26:32.948 --> 05:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
funded to some in some instances through
 
05:26:34.150 --> 05:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
the school through the individual
 
05:26:36.590 --> 05:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
schools my understanding is that it is a
 
05:26:38.910 --> 05:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
it's a line item in ex existing schools
 
05:26:41.868 --> 05:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
and that's been in place thank you
 
05:26:44.310 --> 05:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman thank you madam
 
05:26:45.548 --> 05:26:45.558 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:26:47.350 --> 05:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
question I I'm very familiar with Girls
 
05:26:49.910 --> 05:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
Inc um I lived in Manchester for 27
 
05:26:51.270 --> 05:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
years and was on the school board for
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
four so I do know the great work that it
 
05:26:56.270 --> 05:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
does um but do you know if um the
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester the Nashville School District
 
05:27:00.590 --> 05:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
would stop supplying this product these
 
05:27:02.390 --> 05:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
products with the passage of this bill
 
05:27:04.750 --> 05:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
do you have any inside information on
 
05:27:07.868 --> 05:27:07.878 align:start position:0%
that I do not know the answer to that
 
05:27:07.878 --> 05:27:09.190 align:start position:0%
that I do not know the answer to that
question

05:27:09.190 --> 05:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:27:12.390 --> 05:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
um May I Madam chair I I also wanted to
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
um this is more of a statement than a
 
05:27:16.150 --> 05:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
question but I do know that Manchester
 
05:27:18.910 --> 05:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
has independently been supplying those
 
05:27:21.270 --> 05:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
items for years without any state
 
05:27:23.830 --> 05:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
intervention I'm not sure about nashaa
 
05:27:26.190 --> 05:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
um so I I tend to believe that
 
05:27:28.470 --> 05:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester would definitely not stop
 
05:27:31.510 --> 05:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
supplying um those products to those
 
05:27:33.910 --> 05:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
those girls with the passage of this
 
05:27:37.470 --> 05:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
bill so um you know if you do know that
 
05:27:39.070 --> 05:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Ash is going to stop
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
giving those giving those products out
 
05:27:42.390 --> 05:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
to the girls because of the passages
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
this bill I think you should alert this
 
05:27:47.390 --> 05:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
committee thank you thank you
 
05:27:49.470 --> 05:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
representative cig thank you so much and
 
05:27:51.628 --> 05:27:51.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
05:27:53.628 --> 05:27:53.638 align:start position:0%
know your organization works with um
 
05:27:57.350 --> 05:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
younger girls as well and um it's my
 
05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
understanding and you may not be the one
 
05:28:01.670 --> 05:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
who is the answer to this um but is that
 
05:28:04.628 --> 05:28:04.638 align:start position:0%
we're seeing um an increase in girls
 
05:28:07.670 --> 05:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
beginning to menstrate much younger than
 
05:28:10.708 --> 05:28:10.718 align:start position:0%
um you know even my 11-year-old self was
 
05:28:12.868 --> 05:28:12.878 align:start position:0%
um which means that we're now seeing
 
05:28:14.708 --> 05:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
needs for these products even in
 
05:28:16.830 --> 05:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
elementary schools for like third
 
05:28:20.708 --> 05:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
graders and fourth graders um and so I'm
 
05:28:22.270 --> 05:28:22.280 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if you have any information
 
05:28:24.470 --> 05:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
about that and then also along with that
 
05:28:26.830 --> 05:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
I'm also thinking about a girl who might
 
05:28:31.270 --> 05:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
have a a single father or maybe multiple
 
05:28:33.708 --> 05:28:33.718 align:start position:0%
fathers in their home but not uh a
 
05:28:36.230 --> 05:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
female figure that they can reach out to
 
05:28:38.590 --> 05:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
at the onset of their men's
 
05:28:40.030 --> 05:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
and and the impact of that and so I just
 
05:28:41.830 --> 05:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
wonder if you might have any insight as
 
05:28:44.110 --> 05:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
to either of those I feel like I can
 
05:28:46.830 --> 05:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
comment on that I I'm not sure I have
 
05:28:49.470 --> 05:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
statistics that might support what I'm
 
05:28:52.110 --> 05:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
saying I can tell you what I see um so
 
05:28:53.990 --> 05:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
many girls start their period at Girls
 
05:28:56.390 --> 05:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
Inc and and so many of them are very
 
05:28:59.830 --> 05:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
very young and um we tend to be the
 
05:29:02.310 --> 05:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
people they talk to about that uh we
 
05:29:03.948 --> 05:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
send them home with supplies we give
 
05:29:06.948 --> 05:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
them supplies when they need them and um
 
05:29:10.510 --> 05:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
we certainly have single fathers in our
 
05:29:13.030 --> 05:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
better the single parent of girls in our
 
05:29:16.150 --> 05:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
program and we also have girls that are
 
05:29:19.990 --> 05:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
in households with rapidly changing role
 
05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
models in their home um so it's very
 
05:29:27.230 --> 05:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
important that we play the role we do
 
05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
with them starting their period And I
 
05:29:31.830 --> 05:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
think schools with the goal of keeping
 
05:29:34.948 --> 05:29:34.958 align:start position:0%
kids in class and girls will not go to
 
05:29:37.430 --> 05:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
school if they do if they have a heavy
 
05:29:39.070 --> 05:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
period and don't don't have supplies
 
05:29:41.708 --> 05:29:41.718 align:start position:0%
period they just no pun intended they
 
05:29:43.350 --> 05:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
they stay
 
05:29:47.750 --> 05:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
home and um so to comment on your
 
05:29:49.788 --> 05:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
question uh yes many girls are starting
 
05:29:53.070 --> 05:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
earlier and need supplies and we Supply
 
05:29:55.030 --> 05:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
them and schools supplying them only
 
05:29:58.070 --> 05:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
makes sense thank you so
 
05:30:00.350 --> 05:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
much any other
 
05:30:05.910 --> 05:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:19.310 --> 05:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:20.868 --> 05:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madame chair and members
 
05:30:22.750 --> 05:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh my name is Rachel
 
05:30:24.070 --> 05:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
Glansberg I'm a student over at
 
05:30:26.070 --> 05:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and I serve on the youth
 
05:30:27.590 --> 05:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
advisory Council of the organization
 
05:30:29.548 --> 05:30:29.558 align:start position:0%
period and briefly I just wanted to
 
05:30:31.350 --> 05:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
share an additional student perspective
 
05:30:33.670 --> 05:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
as to just how important it is to uphold
 
05:30:36.390 --> 05:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
this bill um menal products are just as
 
05:30:38.430 --> 05:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
essential as toilet paper so and paper
 
05:30:40.590 --> 05:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
towels in school restrooms menstruation
 
05:30:42.390 --> 05:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
is a natural biological process
 
05:30:43.708 --> 05:30:43.718 align:start position:0%
experienced by more than half the
 
05:30:45.390 --> 05:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
population for a significant portion of
 
05:30:47.628 --> 05:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
their lives denying access to these
 
05:30:49.430 --> 05:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
products stigmatizes menstruation and
 
05:30:51.708 --> 05:30:51.718 align:start position:0%
perpetuates gender inequality now when I
 
05:30:53.150 --> 05:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
was in high school just a few short
 
05:30:55.110 --> 05:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
months ago I saw firsthand how the lack
 
05:30:57.230 --> 05:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
of access to Metal Products impacted my
 
05:30:59.470 --> 05:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
peers many students had to leave class
 
05:31:01.030 --> 05:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
to search for a product often feeling
 
05:31:03.030 --> 05:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
embarrassed or ashamed to ask for help
 
05:31:04.628 --> 05:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
some even miss school entirely because
 
05:31:06.310 --> 05:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
their parents their families simply
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford these basic necessities
 
05:31:10.708 --> 05:31:10.718 align:start position:0%
witnessing this inequity motivated me to
 
05:31:12.670 --> 05:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
take action and back in New Jersey I
 
05:31:14.110 --> 05:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
worked with my school administration and
 
05:31:15.510 --> 05:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
student groups to ensure that menual
 
05:31:17.150 --> 05:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
products were freely available in our
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
restrooms this initiative not only
 
05:31:20.708 --> 05:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
reduced the stigma surrounding periods
 
05:31:22.110 --> 05:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
but also created a more supportive
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
environment where students could focus
 
05:31:24.910 --> 05:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
on learning instead of worrying about
 
05:31:27.310 --> 05:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
their next pad or tampon now inspired by
 
05:31:28.708 --> 05:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
the impact this project had within my
 
05:31:30.628 --> 05:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
own school I advocated for New Jersey's
 
05:31:33.310 --> 05:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
version of this bill bill S1 1221 which
 
05:31:34.910 --> 05:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
provided free menal products in our
 
05:31:36.750 --> 05:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
restrooms and the positive impact of
 
05:31:39.310 --> 05:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
this program was absolutely undeniable
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
attendance improved and students
 
05:31:42.390 --> 05:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
expressed relief and gratitude for
 
05:31:43.670 --> 05:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
having one less barrier to their
 
05:31:46.030 --> 05:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
education this experience is why I feel
 
05:31:47.910 --> 05:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
so strongly that every student deserves
 
05:31:49.350 --> 05:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
access to menstral products in their
 
05:31:51.430 --> 05:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
school restrooms in speaking with the
 
05:31:53.350 --> 05:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
students of hampsh New Hampshire I know
 
05:31:57.390 --> 05:31:57.400 align:start position:0%
that RSA 18916 a is similarly critical
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
in allowing students to thrive in and
 
05:32:01.110 --> 05:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
out of the classroom again period
 
05:32:02.788 --> 05:32:02.798 align:start position:0%
poverty affects one in four students
 
05:32:04.510 --> 05:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
Nationwide a figure that is worsened due
 
05:32:07.150 --> 05:32:07.160 align:start position:0%
to the covid-19 pandemic according to
 
05:32:09.190 --> 05:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
the 2023 restated the period study by
 
05:32:11.590 --> 05:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
period and thanks nearly 23% of
 
05:32:13.070 --> 05:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
menstrating students have struggled to
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
afford menstrual products this lack of
 
05:32:17.390 --> 05:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
access had significant consequences for
 
05:32:19.750 --> 05:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
students many Miss class time or even
 
05:32:21.390 --> 05:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
entire school days because they don't
 
05:32:23.070 --> 05:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
have the resources to manage their
 
05:32:25.670 --> 05:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
periods these absences hinder academic
 
05:32:27.270 --> 05:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
performance and increase the risk of
 
05:32:29.430 --> 05:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
long-term social and EM social and
 
05:32:32.190 --> 05:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
economic disadvantages without access to
 
05:32:34.230 --> 05:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
proper products students May resort to
 
05:32:36.910 --> 05:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
unsafe Alternatives or use products for
 
05:32:38.788 --> 05:32:38.798 align:start position:0%
longer than recommended which increases
 
05:32:40.350 --> 05:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
their risk of infections and other
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
health complications furthermore the
 
05:32:44.190 --> 05:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
stigma and embarrassment associated with
 
05:32:46.310 --> 05:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
lacking menstrual products takes a heavy
 
05:32:48.548 --> 05:32:48.558 align:start position:0%
emotional D leading to feelings of Shame
 
05:32:51.590 --> 05:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
anxiety and isolation repealing RSA
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
18916 a would send a message that
 
05:32:56.070 --> 05:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
menstrating students needs are secondary
 
05:32:57.910 --> 05:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
exacerbating period poverty and
 
05:32:59.788 --> 05:32:59.798 align:start position:0%
educational disparities it would Place
 
05:33:01.390 --> 05:33:01.400 align:start position:0%
undue burdens on students and their
 
05:33:03.310 --> 05:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
families forcing some to choose between
 
05:33:04.990 --> 05:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
attending school and managing their
 
05:33:07.788 --> 05:33:07.798 align:start position:0%
periods again any bill that prioritizes
 
05:33:09.708 --> 05:33:09.718 align:start position:0%
the health dignity and education of all
 
05:33:11.948 --> 05:33:11.958 align:start position:0%
students is of the utmost importance so
 
05:33:13.948 --> 05:33:13.958 align:start position:0%
any changes amendments whatever it needs
 
05:33:15.390 --> 05:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
that need to be made most important
 
05:33:16.390 --> 05:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
thing of all is that we're getting these
 
05:33:18.150 --> 05:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
students the dignity they deserve that's
 
05:33:20.470 --> 05:33:20.480 align:start position:0%

05:33:57.510 --> 05:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
the president of the United Way of
 
05:34:00.510 --> 05:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
Greater Nashua and um she had to leave I
 
05:34:01.948 --> 05:34:01.958 align:start position:0%
see but I wanted to also just
 
05:34:03.708 --> 05:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
acknowledge Abigail for coming and
 
05:34:05.190 --> 05:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
giving testimony today I think that was
 
05:34:07.070 --> 05:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
pretty wonderful to see a young person
 
05:34:08.310 --> 05:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
05:34:11.070 --> 05:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
um in a just a sidebar representative C
 
05:34:13.230 --> 05:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
you asked a question about the age of
 
05:34:15.788 --> 05:34:15.798 align:start position:0%
menstrating students we know I know
 
05:34:17.510 --> 05:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
personally from experience of talking
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
with student with School nurses in the
 
05:34:22.548 --> 05:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
nashaa school district that they're um
 
05:34:23.990 --> 05:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
typically seeing third and fourth
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
graders at this point so even though
 
05:34:28.990 --> 05:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
this law only applies to middle school
 
05:34:32.470 --> 05:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
and high school level um gosh don't we
 
05:34:34.948 --> 05:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
wish it was actually expanded to include
 
05:34:37.868 --> 05:34:37.878 align:start position:0%
all uh all School levels and was going
 
05:34:39.430 --> 05:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the other direction
 
05:34:41.190 --> 05:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
altogether um just a couple of
 
05:34:44.190 --> 05:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
additional points that haven't been made
 
05:34:46.070 --> 05:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
we I've come up with a list of five
 
05:34:48.628 --> 05:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
different points for why we believe that
 
05:34:51.628 --> 05:34:51.638 align:start position:0%
it's important to oppose HB 415 um first
 
05:34:53.070 --> 05:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
of all basic needs should never be a
 
05:34:55.990 --> 05:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
barrier to success menstrual hygiene
 
05:34:57.350 --> 05:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
products are essential for students to
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
feel confident and prepared during the
 
05:35:01.708 --> 05:35:01.718 align:start position:0%
school day without access to these items
 
05:35:04.590 --> 05:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
students feel unnecessary challenges
 
05:35:05.948 --> 05:35:05.958 align:start position:0%
that are infer with their ability to
 
05:35:08.590 --> 05:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
focus on their learning I'm gonna say
 
05:35:11.350 --> 05:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
personally I have a daughter who happens
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
to be a guidance counselor in one of
 
05:35:15.948 --> 05:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
NASA's middle schools and so we have
 
05:35:17.350 --> 05:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
interesting conversations around the
 
05:35:19.390 --> 05:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
dinner table as you might imagine which
 
05:35:21.510 --> 05:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
include all manner of student Behavior
 
05:35:24.510 --> 05:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
what one of those is that she will
 
05:35:26.948 --> 05:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely acknowledge that she has do
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
CH children girls who will not come to
 
05:35:30.310 --> 05:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
school because they are having their
 
05:35:32.310 --> 05:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
period or they're surprised by their
 
05:35:34.430 --> 05:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
period or they do not have access to the
 
05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
products because they can't afford them
 
05:35:37.830 --> 05:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
one point that has not been made yet yet
 
05:35:40.390 --> 05:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
today is that these products are not
 
05:35:42.470 --> 05:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
covered by any of the social safety net
 
05:35:45.750 --> 05:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
programs like like food food stamps or
 
05:35:48.628 --> 05:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
um you know U Wick so these are
 
05:35:50.350 --> 05:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket expenses that have to be
 
05:35:52.270 --> 05:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
born by the families and are quite
 
05:35:54.430 --> 05:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
expensive uring fairness for all
 
05:35:56.548 --> 05:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
students current law ensures that no
 
05:35:58.110 --> 05:35:58.120 align:start position:0%
student is at disadvantage because of
 
05:36:00.310 --> 05:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
their financial circumstances removing
 
05:36:01.990 --> 05:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
this requirement with disproportionately
 
05:36:04.110 --> 05:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
affect those who are already struggling
 
05:36:05.670 --> 05:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
that creates an uneven playing field in
 
05:36:07.030 --> 05:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
our schools I think that's something we
 
05:36:09.830 --> 05:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
would all College we do not want um
 
05:36:13.230 --> 05:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
supporting health and wellness the um
 
05:36:16.110 --> 05:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
the speaker Abigail mentioned uh making
 
05:36:18.628 --> 05:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
some unhealthy unsafe decisions about
 
05:36:23.750 --> 05:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
using um toilet paper in Le of a pad um
 
05:36:25.430 --> 05:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
when students lack access to menstrual
 
05:36:27.030 --> 05:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
products they may resort to unsafe
 
05:36:28.590 --> 05:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
Alternatives or prolong the use of a
 
05:36:29.990 --> 05:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
single product which can lead to health
 
05:36:32.830 --> 05:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
issues such as infections I think uh
 
05:36:34.910 --> 05:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're all are aware of that this law
 
05:36:36.390 --> 05:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
ensures that students can manage their
 
05:36:39.470 --> 05:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
personal health needs without um safely
 
05:36:42.230 --> 05:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
without dignity and without stigma and
 
05:36:44.788 --> 05:36:44.798 align:start position:0%
um you know lastly I would say the cost
 
05:36:46.868 --> 05:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
has been brought up several times I
 
05:36:48.868 --> 05:36:48.878 align:start position:0%
think the uh representative Edwards
 
05:36:50.750 --> 05:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
stated that the reason for this
 
05:36:52.708 --> 05:36:52.718 align:start position:0%
particular legislation is to get rid of
 
05:36:55.030 --> 05:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
an unfunded mandate um I think the
 
05:36:56.750 --> 05:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
funding involved is really you know
 
05:36:58.548 --> 05:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
fairly minimal in the large scheme of
 
05:37:02.230 --> 05:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
things and um especially when you
 
05:37:03.670 --> 05:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
compare to the benefits of improved
 
05:37:05.670 --> 05:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
attendance participation overall
 
05:37:08.230 --> 05:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
well-being so we at United way would
 
05:37:10.990 --> 05:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely encourage you to vote this
 
05:37:12.910 --> 05:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and to support
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
the current current law and I'll I have
 
05:37:16.628 --> 05:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I'll share with
 
05:37:19.270 --> 05:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
you but I'll also take any questions if
 
05:37:23.590 --> 05:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:26.110 --> 05:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
05:37:30.548 --> 05:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:32.788 --> 05:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
it is there anyone else looking to
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
testify on this
 
05:37:37.750 --> 05:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill okay we're going to close the heing
 
05:37:40.070 --> 05:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
05:37:42.310 --> 05:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
4155 we'll have to take a little bit of
 
05:37:46.510 --> 05:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
a break so we can find our missing
 
05:38:06.430 --> 05:38:06.440 align:start position:0%

yeah that's I want to get
 
05:48:04.330 --> 05:48:21.150 align:start position:0%
yeah that's I want to get
[Laughter]

05:48:21.150 --> 05:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:24.030 --> 05:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
okay I think we have a couple of bills
 
05:48:26.350 --> 05:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
we want to take care of this
 
05:48:30.788 --> 05:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon um the first um we'll take a
 
05:48:35.670 --> 05:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
look at is HB 116 relative to reporting
 
05:48:38.030 --> 05:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
05:48:40.910 --> 05:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
publicy and uh representative Freeman
 
05:48:43.270 --> 05:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
did you have a a motion U yes Mr
 
05:48:44.830 --> 05:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd like to make the motion of
 
05:48:46.628 --> 05:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
in expedient to
 
05:48:49.270 --> 05:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
legislate second second by
 
05:48:49.280 --> 05:48:50.910 align:start position:0%
legislate second second by
representative

05:48:50.910 --> 05:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:48:54.590 --> 05:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.070 --> 05:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
05:49:00.070 --> 05:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
Hall yes um I just want to make
 
05:49:01.948 --> 05:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
reference to I agree with the motion
 
05:49:04.628 --> 05:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
actually um and I would like make
 
05:49:06.430 --> 05:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
reference to Cole Brown we only heard
 
05:49:09.468 --> 05:49:09.478 align:start position:0%
from Pinkerton that day um and Cole
 
05:49:10.868 --> 05:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
Brown I spoke with them yesterday they
 
05:49:13.708 --> 05:49:13.718 align:start position:0%
sent us this letter and basically saying
 
05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know what we don't get any state
 
05:49:17.708 --> 05:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
funding no adequacy funding no special
 
05:49:20.548 --> 05:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
ed funding no CTE funding no building
 
05:49:22.510 --> 05:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
Aid they asked for a grant the doe said
 
05:49:24.510 --> 05:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
no and
 
05:49:27.390 --> 05:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
so it just doesn't make sense that the
 
05:49:29.990 --> 05:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
um that they would be held to
 
05:49:33.868 --> 05:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
this thank you thank you any further uh
 
05:49:37.670 --> 05:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
comments from anybody on the committee
 
05:49:39.510 --> 05:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
I see none oh yes I'm sorry
 
05:49:42.150 --> 05:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative s thank you I I think I
 
05:49:45.670 --> 05:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
would say to if if the members of um the
 
05:49:47.070 --> 05:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
school districts that are involved with
 
05:49:49.190 --> 05:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
these Publicis are listening and
 
05:49:51.708 --> 05:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
following our our hearing today I would
 
05:49:53.390 --> 05:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
just encourage them if they are having
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
complications there's they should
 
05:49:57.150 --> 05:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
certainly band together and go together
 
05:49:58.948 --> 05:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
to talk about their contracts together
 
05:50:01.708 --> 05:50:01.718 align:start position:0%
with the provider school and figure out
 
05:50:03.548 --> 05:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
a way to work things out in a way that's
 
05:50:06.030 --> 05:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
Equitable and fair for all of them right
 
05:50:08.590 --> 05:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
yes I think I would agree that uh it
 
05:50:12.230 --> 05:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's a a solution that uh is
 
05:50:15.270 --> 05:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
probably workable uh ifone sits down
 
05:50:18.270 --> 05:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
together um I think format uh is
 
05:50:20.990 --> 05:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
something that uh we've taken care of
 
05:50:25.150 --> 05:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
for uh quite a number of decades um so I
 
05:50:27.948 --> 05:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
I think uh I think it's a solvable
 
05:50:31.590 --> 05:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
problem without uh State legislation at
 
05:50:34.390 --> 05:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
this point representative Hall thank you

the amendment thank you so the bill is
 
05:54:04.830 --> 05:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
brought forward with simply enabling
 
05:54:06.708 --> 05:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
legislation where right now now the
 
05:54:10.350 --> 05:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
school district Treasurer is elected and
 
05:54:12.190 --> 05:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
we had received feedback that maybe
 
05:54:13.990 --> 05:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes folks did not have all the
 
05:54:15.910 --> 05:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
qualifications necessary for that
 
05:54:18.110 --> 05:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
position this amendment that I'm putting
 
05:54:20.430 --> 05:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
forward is just to set the bar a little
 
05:54:23.708 --> 05:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
bit higher um when we go and this
 
05:54:25.390 --> 05:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
warrant article is brought forward to
 
05:54:27.390 --> 05:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
change the position from an elected
 
05:54:29.510 --> 05:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
position to an appointed position I just
 
05:54:32.390 --> 05:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the voters um are
 
05:54:34.910 --> 05:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
informed of the gravity of the decision
 
05:54:37.868 --> 05:54:37.878 align:start position:0%
and just change it to a 3 F vote in
 
05:54:40.670 --> 05:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
other words 60% if the voters should
 
05:54:42.750 --> 05:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
decide to undo this at some point and
 
05:54:44.190 --> 05:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
they would like to see this position
 
05:54:47.150 --> 05:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
elected again versus appointed uh they
 
05:54:50.270 --> 05:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
just need a simple majority to do
 
05:54:54.350 --> 05:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you um
 
05:54:54.360 --> 05:54:56.468 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you um
and

05:54:56.468 --> 05:54:56.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:54:59.910 --> 05:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
um is there a second to her Amendment on
 
05:55:03.070 --> 05:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment her motion on the
 
05:55:06.110 --> 05:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
amendment represent Morris one second
 
05:55:09.670 --> 05:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:09.680 --> 05:55:11.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:55:11.788 --> 05:55:11.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:11.798 --> 05:55:14.030 align:start position:0%
um
representative

05:55:14.030 --> 05:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:55:16.788 --> 05:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
yes so as it stands right now the school
 
05:55:19.510 --> 05:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
districts elect um they'll elect their
 
05:55:22.110 --> 05:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
Treasurer right if they don't have
 
05:55:24.350 --> 05:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
someone um that's on the ballot or if
 
05:55:26.390 --> 05:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
the person leaves then they appoint them
 
05:55:28.110 --> 05:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
so the legislation that was brought
 
05:55:30.750 --> 05:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
forward was to put a warrant article
 
05:55:33.468 --> 05:55:33.478 align:start position:0%
forward if a town so desires instead of
 
05:55:36.270 --> 05:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
having the treasurer elected then the
 
05:55:38.110 --> 05:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
Treasurer would be appointed from then
 
05:55:41.230 --> 05:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
on um I just don't necessarily agree
 
05:55:43.390 --> 05:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
with taking away that right from the
 
05:55:46.070 --> 05:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
voters they currently can vote on it so
 
05:55:48.670 --> 05:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
my feeling was what if we compromise and
 
05:55:50.830 --> 05:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
we just set the bar a little bit higher
 
05:55:52.948 --> 05:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
we're still just enabling legislation
 
05:55:55.468 --> 05:55:55.478 align:start position:0%
and we're saying to the towns yes you
 
05:55:57.468 --> 05:55:57.478 align:start position:0%
may vote you know you may vote to change
 
05:55:59.390 --> 05:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
this and appoint the treasurer but it's
 
05:56:09.230 --> 05:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:11.708 --> 05:56:11.718 align:start position:0%
repres Woodcock thank you Mr
 
05:56:16.030 --> 05:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
chair question I may um any other ballot
 
05:56:18.310 --> 05:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
on the warrant
 
05:56:20.830 --> 05:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
article does that uh that's on an
 
05:56:24.070 --> 05:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
article for normal uh spring warrant
 
05:56:26.310 --> 05:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
does does it have a 60% requirement or
 
05:56:28.430 --> 05:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
just have a
 
05:56:30.390 --> 05:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
majority I was going to say off the top
 
05:56:32.948 --> 05:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
my head I only know bonds I'm not sure
 
05:56:36.990 --> 05:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
about other things I me May is sure I'm
 
05:56:39.830 --> 05:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
is this a rhetorical question represent
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
we've created no I'm just concern we
 
05:56:45.030 --> 05:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
created a a bar everywhere else we use
 
05:56:48.270 --> 05:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
50% for election 51 or what whatever the
 
05:56:51.350 --> 05:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
game is but 60% is a heck of a number
 
05:56:52.708 --> 05:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
pretty restrictive I just wonder why it
 
05:56:54.548 --> 05:56:54.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just be leave it as it is a
 
05:56:54.558 --> 05:56:55.990 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just be leave it as it is a
majority

05:56:55.990 --> 05:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
majority
 
05:56:59.548 --> 05:56:59.558 align:start position:0%
vote so that's all just speaking for me
 
05:57:01.948 --> 05:57:01.958 align:start position:0%
um it just makes me very uncomfortable
 
05:57:05.110 --> 05:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
to take a position that is elected and I
 
05:57:07.110 --> 05:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
feel as though we're almost taking away
 
05:57:09.430 --> 05:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
that sa from the voters and we're going
 
05:57:12.590 --> 05:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
to make it an appointed position so I
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
just I just felt that this is fair thank
 
05:57:17.310 --> 05:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr
 
05:57:20.350 --> 05:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
chair uh represent
 
05:57:23.468 --> 05:57:23.478 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
05:57:26.110 --> 05:57:26.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I guess one one
 
05:57:27.830 --> 05:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
part that I want to make sure I'm
 
05:57:29.390 --> 05:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
understanding with respect to the
 
05:57:31.150 --> 05:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
amendment of
 
05:57:34.110 --> 05:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
043 um the two changes that I see
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
actually are the change of uh to a three
 
05:57:37.920 --> 05:57:39.150 align:start position:0%
actually are the change of uh to a three
fth

05:57:39.150 --> 05:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
fth
 
05:57:41.750 --> 05:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
requirement uh on the warrant article to
 
05:57:45.070 --> 05:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
pass and then the other one was a change
 
05:57:49.190 --> 05:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
in language on line 8 from the original
 
05:57:52.948 --> 05:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
Bill HB 93 to the amendment where it
 
05:57:55.948 --> 05:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
then also adds by a simple majority is
 
05:57:55.958 --> 05:58:01.430 align:start position:0%
then also adds by a simple majority is
that

05:58:01.430 --> 05:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:04.910 --> 05:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
correct yes so to undo it it's a simple
 
05:58:07.310 --> 05:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
majority to move the other direction
 
05:58:11.750 --> 05:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:14.948 --> 05:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
yes yes representative Cornell I'm not
 
05:58:17.190 --> 05:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
all that familiar with warrant articles
 
05:58:19.190 --> 05:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
in Manchester we don't have them so I is
 
05:58:21.910 --> 05:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
that three fifths of people voting on
 
05:58:24.670 --> 05:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
that day or three- fifths of the entire
 
05:58:25.868 --> 05:58:25.878 align:start position:0%
eligible to
 
05:58:31.390 --> 05:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:34.830 --> 05:58:34.840 align:start position:0%
you yes sure and then and then just a
 
05:58:38.510 --> 05:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
simple majority of The District board or
 
05:58:41.070 --> 05:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
is that I I I'm still wanting to make
 
05:58:42.430 --> 05:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
sure I'm
 
05:58:42.440 --> 05:58:48.750 align:start position:0%
sure I'm
understanding

05:58:48.750 --> 05:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:51.190 --> 05:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
line8 so it's the is it the board or is
 
05:58:53.990 --> 05:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
it the voters I'm sorry it's the
 
05:58:57.910 --> 05:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:07.468 --> 05:59:07.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:09.468 --> 05:59:09.478 align:start position:0%
it's that way in the original
 
05:59:24.750 --> 05:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:29.590 --> 05:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
originally um well how did it pass must
 
05:59:31.310 --> 05:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry there a
 
05:59:34.150 --> 05:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
question okay I did ask a question just
 
05:59:36.628 --> 05:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make sure that I was clearly
 
05:59:39.628 --> 05:59:39.638 align:start position:0%
one is a vote by The District board and
 
05:59:42.468 --> 05:59:42.478 align:start position:0%
one is by the voters at large under
 
05:59:45.230 --> 05:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
warrant I don't see a board on all I see
 
05:59:49.150 --> 05:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:52.990 --> 05:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
district be made inance with rs76 by the
 
05:59:53.000 --> 05:59:56.070 align:start position:0%
district be made inance with rs76 by the
school

05:59:56.070 --> 05:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:00.270 --> 06:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
board right um one thing I just noticed
 
06:00:04.390 --> 06:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
um and it's the same way in the original
 
06:00:06.708 --> 06:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
in the original it's online
 
06:00:06.718 --> 06:00:09.948 align:start position:0%
in the original it's online
10

06:00:09.948 --> 06:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:15.750 --> 06:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:18.788 --> 06:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
there no I I I guess it's okay um I'm
 
06:00:23.548 --> 06:00:23.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:27.110 --> 06:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
myself to rec the
 
06:00:29.948 --> 06:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
appointment when it goes right yeah Mr
 
06:00:32.150 --> 06:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
chairman it's it it at least seems that
 
06:00:35.190 --> 06:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's unclear as to the meaning and I I
 
06:00:37.750 --> 06:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
think it needs a little more work to be
 
06:00:40.390 --> 06:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
clear about the intent what what do we
 
06:00:43.468 --> 06:00:43.478 align:start position:0%
mean here do we mean any the voters of a
 
06:00:45.190 --> 06:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
school district do we mean the do we
 
06:00:47.110 --> 06:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
mean the school board we have to know
 
06:00:49.708 --> 06:00:49.718 align:start position:0%
what we mean rather than leave it vague
 
06:00:52.750 --> 06:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
right I'm not sure uh I'm on the line
 
06:00:54.628 --> 06:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
eight uh to the
 
06:00:57.030 --> 06:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
amendment line eight says any school
 
06:00:58.670 --> 06:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
district May resend a vote what does
 
06:00:58.680 --> 06:01:00.468 align:start position:0%
district May resend a vote what does
that

06:01:00.468 --> 06:01:00.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:01:03.150 --> 06:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
mean what's a school district just
 
06:01:04.948 --> 06:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
curious though this is in the I don't
 
06:01:06.190 --> 06:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
disagree with you but it's it's in the
 
06:01:08.110 --> 06:01:08.120 align:start position:0%
original Bill too we just carried it
 
06:01:10.990 --> 06:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
over line8 then we may have missed it in
 
06:01:12.468 --> 06:01:12.478 align:start position:0%
the original Bill do you have the
 
06:01:15.628 --> 06:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
original bill yeah I do
 
06:01:20.390 --> 06:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:23.708 --> 06:01:23.718 align:start position:0%
bill it says it
 
06:01:27.350 --> 06:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
says yes it you carried the L excuse me
 
06:01:29.670 --> 06:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
the language was carried over but I'm
 
06:01:32.350 --> 06:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
noticing that it it's vague in the bill
 
06:01:36.750 --> 06:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
as well so you've done a a service here
 
06:01:39.270 --> 06:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
at the very least with the amendment by
 
06:01:41.948 --> 06:01:41.958 align:start position:0%
pointing out to us that we've got vager
 
06:01:45.230 --> 06:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
that needs to be clarified right school
 
06:01:46.628 --> 06:01:46.638 align:start position:0%
school warn
 
06:01:48.948 --> 06:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
articles they now
 
06:01:52.190 --> 06:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
now is on their own side
 
06:01:52.200 --> 06:01:53.708 align:start position:0%
now is on their own side
see

06:01:53.708 --> 06:01:53.718 align:start position:0%
see
 
06:01:57.270 --> 06:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
yes I I wonder where we're trying to
 
06:02:00.230 --> 06:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
figure out the intricacies of the
 
06:02:02.750 --> 06:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
language and the specificity if it might
 
06:02:05.270 --> 06:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
be best to recess the executive hearing
 
06:02:07.190 --> 06:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
on this till m when we're executing
 
06:02:08.510 --> 06:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
other bills so that there's an
 
06:02:12.110 --> 06:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um for whoever wants to
 
06:02:13.390 --> 06:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
work on the amendment to get the
 
06:02:15.430 --> 06:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
language clarified so that we
 
06:02:18.270 --> 06:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
can make sure we're voting on a
 
06:02:21.830 --> 06:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
something we all understand
 
06:02:25.788 --> 06:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
um that's diplomatic yeah I I I would
 
06:02:30.030 --> 06:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:33.510 --> 06:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
1973 um which is raising money at a
 
06:02:36.670 --> 06:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
special meeting um no School District at
 
06:02:38.110 --> 06:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
a special meeting shall rais your
 
06:02:40.150 --> 06:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate money I think it's pretty
 
06:02:42.310 --> 06:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
clear they're talking about the voters
 
06:02:44.590 --> 06:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
in that school district not the School
 
06:02:46.548 --> 06:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
District board I I think probably the
 
06:02:50.788 --> 06:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:54.110 --> 06:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
here Mr chair yes it is it possible to
 
06:02:55.750 --> 06:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
ask if Miss Wilson from the school
 
06:03:04.350 --> 06:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:11.070 --> 06:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:13.390 --> 06:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
Jen good afternoon sorry I'm still
 
06:03:14.468 --> 06:03:14.478 align:start position:0%
getting used to
 
06:03:16.788 --> 06:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
this uh for the record Becky Wilson from
 
06:03:18.110 --> 06:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school boards
 
06:03:20.708 --> 06:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
Association I Are there specific
 
06:03:24.150 --> 06:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
questions I will give you my two second
 
06:03:26.430 --> 06:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh assessment of this which is and I did
 
06:03:28.830 --> 06:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
just double check with bar Christina uh
 
06:03:30.670 --> 06:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
the majority of warrants are simple
 
06:03:33.670 --> 06:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
majority unless they involve finances or
 
06:03:38.548 --> 06:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:42.310 --> 06:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
right and um there was a question about
 
06:03:46.708 --> 06:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
the language any school district um my
 
06:03:47.948 --> 06:03:47.958 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that would mean
 
06:03:49.910 --> 06:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
the voters of the school
 
06:03:53.468 --> 06:03:53.478 align:start position:0%
district uh thank you for the question I
 
06:03:54.910 --> 06:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
I think if there's question about the
 
06:03:56.590 --> 06:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that language it may
 
06:03:58.868 --> 06:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
make sense to try to clarify what is
 
06:04:01.548 --> 06:04:01.558 align:start position:0%
actually intended with that a school
 
06:04:04.548 --> 06:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
district is not necessarily a voting
 
06:04:08.590 --> 06:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
body I the the members of the town that
 
06:04:10.110 --> 06:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
make up the school district would be the
 
06:04:12.830 --> 06:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
voters of the district as opposed to the
 
06:04:16.190 --> 06:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
school district which is its own entity
 
06:04:19.310 --> 06:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
per se I just I it may it may make sense
 
06:04:21.110 --> 06:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
to try to clarify what the intention of
 
06:04:24.070 --> 06:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
that language really is yeah um in the
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
original bill um if we look at section
 
06:04:29.390 --> 06:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
two um the only amendment is the
 
06:04:32.830 --> 06:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
addition of an RSA but the uh current
 
06:04:36.190 --> 06:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
statutory language says at each School
 
06:04:38.310 --> 06:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
district election each School District
 
06:04:41.190 --> 06:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
which is not a Cooperative uh shall
 
06:04:44.548 --> 06:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
elect uh again I think clearly talking
 
06:04:47.030 --> 06:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
about the voters in that school district
 
06:04:49.190 --> 06:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
same same in the first line the school
 
06:04:49.200 --> 06:04:50.468 align:start position:0%
same same in the first line the school
district

06:04:50.468 --> 06:04:50.478 align:start position:0%
district
 
06:04:50.478 --> 06:04:53.708 align:start position:0%
district
yeah

06:04:53.708 --> 06:04:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:57.750 --> 06:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
right does representative Hall thank you
 
06:05:00.230 --> 06:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
Mr I just have a question so the first
 
06:05:02.548 --> 06:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
sentence um says any school district
 
06:05:03.788 --> 06:05:03.798 align:start position:0%
which is not a Cooperative School
 
06:05:06.788 --> 06:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
District so it defines that so now skip
 
06:05:09.110 --> 06:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
down to line8 when it just says any
 
06:05:11.350 --> 06:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
school district is it an assumption that
 
06:05:13.830 --> 06:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
we referring back to sentence number one
 
06:05:16.830 --> 06:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
in a case like that it now doesn't say
 
06:05:18.110 --> 06:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
which is not a Cooperative school
 
06:05:20.150 --> 06:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
district is that a problem or is that
 
06:05:23.110 --> 06:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
just understood to be I I don't see it
 
06:05:26.590 --> 06:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
as a problem you don't see it no does
 
06:05:30.548 --> 06:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:40.468 --> 06:05:40.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:48.190 --> 06:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:52.150 --> 06:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
sorry I wish we could be excused
 
06:05:55.468 --> 06:05:55.478 align:start position:0%
too I just I just I'm sorry Mr chair I
 
06:05:57.868 --> 06:05:57.878 align:start position:0%
just wonder if we could perhaps get a a
 
06:05:59.110 --> 06:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
definitive answer from one of the
 
06:06:00.830 --> 06:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
attorneys about whether we need to make
 
06:06:02.750 --> 06:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
that language more specific I would hate
 
06:06:06.670 --> 06:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
for us to expend the time voting on this
 
06:06:09.590 --> 06:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
only to get it sent back and have to
 
06:06:12.708 --> 06:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
have more hearings because we could have
 
06:06:14.230 --> 06:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
changed a word or added a word for
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
clarification that we might not have
 
06:06:17.990 --> 06:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
realized and if we can just get that
 
06:06:20.830 --> 06:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
corrected or specified maybe we could
 
06:06:26.030 --> 06:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
avoid extra time later um okay you want
 
06:06:28.070 --> 06:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
your your sugges we hold this all over
 
06:06:30.628 --> 06:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
until next week so so that those
 
06:06:32.270 --> 06:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
involved in writing the amendment can
 
06:06:34.270 --> 06:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
verify the language with an attorney and
 
06:06:35.670 --> 06:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
make sure we've got the exact language
 
06:06:38.150 --> 06:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
we need
 
06:06:42.390 --> 06:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
okay yes represent I'm just looking at
 
06:06:45.750 --> 06:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
the any looking at the any school
 
06:06:49.270 --> 06:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
district may send a vote part and it has
 
06:06:51.030 --> 06:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
to be a not a Cooperative School
 
06:06:52.110 --> 06:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
District because they couldn't have
 
06:06:53.708 --> 06:06:53.718 align:start position:0%
gotten to the place where they had
 
06:06:55.510 --> 06:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
appointed a School treasurer if they
 
06:06:57.350 --> 06:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
hadn't been a school district which is
 
06:07:00.230 --> 06:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:00.240 --> 06:07:02.110 align:start position:0%
 
Cooperative

06:07:02.110 --> 06:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
Cooperative
 
06:07:05.948 --> 06:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair so
 
06:07:08.708 --> 06:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
we just heard from Miss Wilson that they
 
06:07:13.190 --> 06:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
only do that um for finances and bonds
 
06:07:15.270 --> 06:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
is that an issue I mean are we concerned
 
06:07:15.280 --> 06:07:16.990 align:start position:0%
is that an issue I mean are we concerned
about

06:07:16.990 --> 06:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:07:19.190 --> 06:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
that right that's what I'm saying I mean
 
06:07:20.910 --> 06:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
do we want do we think it should go back
 
06:07:22.868 --> 06:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
to majority if that's a if you only do
 
06:07:25.350 --> 06:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
it for finances and bonds the treasurer
 
06:07:27.230 --> 06:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
does the finances he does but I don't
 
06:07:30.030 --> 06:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
think that's what it means is it do you
 
06:07:34.190 --> 06:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
think I I don't I'm not sure if that's
 
06:07:36.750 --> 06:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
statute anywhere yes yes I was going to
 
06:07:39.350 --> 06:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
ask although it may not
 
06:07:42.230 --> 06:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
be it may not have ever been before is
 
06:07:45.750 --> 06:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
it prohibited from being by Statute so
 
06:07:48.868 --> 06:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
that hypothetically if we were to say 3
 
06:07:51.110 --> 06:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
fifths we would not be running a muck or
 
06:07:53.750 --> 06:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
a foul of an existing statute with
 
06:07:56.788 --> 06:07:56.798 align:start position:0%
respect to uh warrant articles that
 
06:07:58.948 --> 06:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
requires that it only be a simple
 
06:08:01.590 --> 06:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
majority and not anymore I don't know
 
06:08:05.270 --> 06:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question right um s
 
06:08:05.280 --> 06:08:05.948 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question right um s
yeah

06:08:05.948 --> 06:08:05.958 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:08:08.190 --> 06:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
Woodcock just a question to the chair is
 
06:08:09.948 --> 06:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
it possible that alls could give us an
 
06:08:13.750 --> 06:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
opinion on this um laal staff there I
 
06:08:16.110 --> 06:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
think since a number of people have
 
06:08:19.030 --> 06:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
questions about a couple of aspects um
 
06:08:21.750 --> 06:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
we can hold it over until next week and
 
06:08:21.760 --> 06:08:22.788 align:start position:0%
we can hold it over until next week and
do

06:08:22.788 --> 06:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:08:25.708 --> 06:08:25.718 align:start position:0%
some yeah thank you
 
06:08:28.468 --> 06:08:28.478 align:start position:0%
yeah is everybody okay with
 
06:08:30.590 --> 06:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
litfield okay
 
06:08:36.350 --> 06:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
um that leaves
 
06:08:38.548 --> 06:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
um HB
 
06:08:41.310 --> 06:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
184 establishing a committee to study
 
06:08:43.670 --> 06:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
changing school start
 
06:08:43.680 --> 06:08:45.948 align:start position:0%
changing school start
times

06:08:45.948 --> 06:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
times
 
06:08:49.750 --> 06:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
um I think um a number of us had
 
06:08:53.590 --> 06:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
questions about some of the language um
 
06:08:58.948 --> 06:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
in the bill um and especially um the uh
 
06:09:02.910 --> 06:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
duties uh section for the uh study
 
06:09:05.990 --> 06:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee um which uh
 
06:09:09.990 --> 06:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
seems to indicate that um it's uh
 
06:09:12.628 --> 06:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
looking clearly for uh
 
06:09:14.948 --> 06:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
legislation um out of the study
 
06:09:19.750 --> 06:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee um so uh I think that uh our
 
06:09:22.788 --> 06:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
preference would be to uh hold this over
 
06:09:25.830 --> 06:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
also so we could uh do some uh looking
 
06:09:28.190 --> 06:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
at that language that came up a couple
 
06:09:29.868 --> 06:09:29.878 align:start position:0%
of times during the
 
06:09:29.878 --> 06:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
of times during the
hearing

06:09:33.110 --> 06:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:35.468 --> 06:09:35.478 align:start position:0%
um and um you know we'll have some
 
06:09:38.750 --> 06:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
people um work on uh um what the
 
06:09:41.670 --> 06:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
committee shall actually
 
06:09:45.830 --> 06:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
do is that representative Bon um they're
 
06:09:48.910 --> 06:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
also the composition of the committee um
 
06:09:50.830 --> 06:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
I think was uh limited to just
 
06:09:52.708 --> 06:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
legislators and if you are going to put
 
06:09:54.948 --> 06:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
together a committee that studies such a
 
06:09:57.270 --> 06:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
broad issue it might be need to be more
 
06:09:59.548 --> 06:09:59.558 align:start position:0%
inclusive so I don't know if that's one
 
06:10:02.230 --> 06:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
of the things we could talk about
 
06:10:05.990 --> 06:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah res thank you Mr shair I just point
 
06:10:07.390 --> 06:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
of Border I just want to make sure that
 
06:10:09.190 --> 06:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
that is the difference would be a
 
06:10:11.190 --> 06:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
commission if we're adding stakeholders
 
06:10:13.390 --> 06:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
and a committee if it's just legislative
 
06:10:17.830 --> 06:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
members correct okay right um yeah I I
 
06:10:21.270 --> 06:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
think that uh uh I would prefer to see
 
06:10:24.110 --> 06:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
it stay as a study committee it gives us
 
06:10:26.230 --> 06:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit more flexibility uh
 
06:10:28.628 --> 06:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
commission it's going to be hard to uh
 
06:10:30.990 --> 06:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh round up every PE everybody and have
 
06:10:34.310 --> 06:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
this done by November 1st of this year
 
06:10:37.868 --> 06:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
um and and uh I know that uh there is uh
 
06:10:40.990 --> 06:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
quite a backlog in trying to get uh
 
06:10:43.868 --> 06:10:43.878 align:start position:0%
people um assigned to either a study
 
06:10:47.788 --> 06:10:47.798 align:start position:0%
committee or a um a commission so I
 
06:10:50.750 --> 06:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
think that uh we'll have a better chance
 
06:10:53.030 --> 06:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
um if we keep this as a committee and
 
06:10:57.910 --> 06:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
invite people in uh to provide input um
 
06:11:00.468 --> 06:11:00.478 align:start position:0%
and you know we heard that a number of
 
06:11:04.990 --> 06:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
groups um who had looked at this um had
 
06:11:07.750 --> 06:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh access to studies and so forth
 
06:11:11.868 --> 06:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
already um so uh I think we can um move
 
06:11:15.350 --> 06:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
it uh fairly quickly um and make that
 
06:11:20.910 --> 06:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
November 1st date um once we get it uh
 
06:11:24.468 --> 06:11:24.478 align:start position:0%
passed so if it's all right we'll hold
 
06:11:30.030 --> 06:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
um uh these two until uh next week and
 
06:11:30.040 --> 06:11:31.590 align:start position:0%
um uh these two until uh next week and
um

06:11:31.590 --> 06:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:33.548 --> 06:11:33.558 align:start position:0%
we I don't think we need to make a
 
06:11:35.830 --> 06:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
motion no
 
06:11:39.548 --> 06:11:39.558 align:start position:0%
um we have uh two days next week a
 
06:11:41.310 --> 06:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
Monday and
 
06:11:44.628 --> 06:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um Monday will start at 10:
 
06:11:47.590 --> 06:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
9:30 on uh
 
06:11:51.430 --> 06:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um there'll be a fairly fairly
 
06:11:55.030 --> 06:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
full days um and there'll be notation in
 
06:11:57.628 --> 06:11:57.638 align:start position:0%
the calendar for each that um time
 
06:12:01.030 --> 06:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
permitting we can exact bills um
 
06:12:03.628 --> 06:12:03.638 align:start position:0%
previously heard so uh you know we'll
 
06:12:06.910 --> 06:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
just uh see which say we can fit them in
 
06:12:09.110 --> 06:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
um and when we have uh language ready
 
06:12:13.830 --> 06:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:17.708 --> 06:12:17.718 align:start position:0%
os does that sound good with
 
06:12:21.150 --> 06:12:21.160 align:start position:0%

thought we were holding it over till
 
06:13:34.030 --> 06:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
