Services thank you thank you Mr White
 
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
for being here so in your not your but
 
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
in the comments and the note it
 
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
indicates that
 
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.110 align:start position:0%
indicates that
the

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh the population of people not are
 
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
still ined has gone down by about half
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
over the past year and the weight time
 
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
has dropped by about half over the past
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
year and you or somebody was kinding
 
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
enough to provide me the pointer to your
 
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
online charts and it seems that those
 
00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
numbers were as of May and if you look
 
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
as of today it's gone back up again both
 
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
the uh numbers of people in the uh
 
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms and the length of stay
 
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
that they're there and Mr M if you had
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
anything to say about that if you can
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
so um I I believe this was in response
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
to fist
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
24281 um which was the New Hampshire
 
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
hospital I I think initially where we
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
responded um and and we did provide an
 
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
overview uh just for everyone's
 
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
Awareness on the committee we did
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
provide a link to a dashboard online
 
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
that is for Mission zero which is the
 
00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
state's effort to get weight times down
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
to zero um I mean we we certainly see
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in those numers on a
 
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis um but overall the
 
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 align:start position:0%
trends have been pointing in the right
 
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
direction um are you referring to like
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
most the most recent numbers that you
 
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
were saying were going
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
up right so I'm referring to the the
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
page you sent me to the link you sent me
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
to yeah there's actually three tabs you
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
can choose from the middle one seem to
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
be the one that related to the numbers
 
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
of people in the emergency departments
 
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
awaiting a bed
 
00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
and the and it seems to be a one-ear
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
span basically from last September to
 
00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
this September and it shows as you just
 
00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
indicated and it has two things it has
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
the absolute numbers and it also has the
 
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
rolling 30-day average and in looking at
 
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
that as you just indicated the the trend
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
was down starting last September all the
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
way until I believe May both in terms of
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
the absolute numbers and the rolling uh
 
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
average but since May it has gone the
 
00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
other way it's been trending up not not
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
to the original place it was a year ago
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
but maybe halfway back up if you will
 
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
sure and halfway down in terms of that
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
there what specifically are you looking
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
for a comment on the
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
trend um so I I I don't have the numbers
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
directly in front of me to to that
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
analysis um I can go back and take a
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
look at that and provide more thorough
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
commentary on those numbers but I I'm
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking at them directly in
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
front of me and I think there may be
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
other factors that play as well and I
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
think I would need to check with uh the
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
experts in the field just to make sure
 
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
that we can provide you with a
 
00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 align:start position:0%
comprehensive answer okay thank you
 
00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
followup follow up um so on a separate
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
note related to this can you provide us
 
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
the contract the farum contract you
 
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
referenced when if it's available or
 
00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
when it becomes available sure the the
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
the farum contract that we're currently
 
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
working on that that we're asked to
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
being extended here the Authority for
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
this B yes absolutely we can bring that
 
00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
forward and those metrics uh once we
 
00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 align:start position:0%
releas that to the governor executive
 
00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879 align:start position:0%
Council but it's currently under
 
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
development thank you of
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
course further questions on item
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
24281 seeing none I'll entertain a
 
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
motion to adopt
 
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
it motion by Senator delandro second
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
by representative f um further
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all in favor say
 
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
I I oppose no the item is adopted moving
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
84 I believe
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
it's representative F again has a
 
00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:45.749 align:start position:0%
it's representative F again has a
question

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
um well I guess the first one just the
 
00:07:57.629 --> 00:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
easy one how much money is left to be to
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
be expended that we
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
extending the date for I I I would have
 
00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
to go back and get that figure uh ju
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
just to look at what's encumbered what's
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
been spent year-to date and what's
 
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
available but I I can provide that to
 
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
you pretty easily okay and thank you and
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
the other question is so I asked about
 
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid rollof to which you
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
responded with a very excellent
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
description um but one of the things you
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
put down that was not applicable and yet
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
if I go back and look at the the
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
referenced notes from prior years that's
 
00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
exactly what's referenced in those notes
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm just curious as to you
 
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
know you sort of had these pools of
 
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
money and then they get expended in
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
different ways now the call center thing
 
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
was in all of them but so is Medicaid
 
00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
roll out so I don't think it was
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
completely inapplicable to ask about it
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
because there was no reference in here
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
to that no longer being part of the need
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.150 align:start position:0%
for the
funding

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay so so so is your question will this
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
funding be needed in the in the future
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
because of the because the Medicaid
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
unwind is primarily complete is that
 
00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:04.519 align:start position:0%
your question I guess I make it as more
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
of a statement perhaps if you don't
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
intend to
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
use funding for purposes for which it
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
was priorly said it was being used for
 
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
and they extending that funding that you
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
would just indicate that that funding is
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
no longer NE that component is no longer
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
needed to be funded sure so the um the
 
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
call center currently Fields calls um
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
and often deals with calls for people
 
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
calling about
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh we are including a
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
prioritized need in our next budget for
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
this purpose to continue funding the
 
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
call center because if if we do not have
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
a call center that's funded eligibility
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
um staff will likely be increased with
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
additional burdens which could increase
 
00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:53.079 align:start position:0%
weight times which may have an impact on
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
anybody seeking
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
any discussion Senator Rosen thank you
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
um I do um have a couple of questions
 
00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:11.150 align:start position:0%
um I do um have a couple of questions
this

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
is as I understand the
 
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
narrative this is about the
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
transitional path program housing for
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
individuals who are leaving New
 
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.190 align:start position:0%
individuals who are leaving New
Hampshire

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
hospital it seems
 
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
like we had money and Behavioral Health
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
for this program but we also made a
 
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
to appropriation to the vendor n fi
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
North would it be a fair
 
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
characterization to say that we double
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
budgeted These
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
funds and now the department is
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
transferring one bucket of them to
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
elsewhere no um so I can provide a
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
little bit of History just for all of
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
the members and I'll directly answer did
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
you say no I said no um and and I can
 
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
directly answer your question Senator
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald uh so for context in the fall
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
of 2020 the Department of Health and
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh opened up the uh path
 
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
transitional housing program uh for
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
individuals that were exiting New
 
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital beginning in uh
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
January of 23 uh following approval of a
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
contract in December by GNC with NFI
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
North uh NFI North uh took over
 
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
operating uh the the facility at that
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
point in time um as ref as Senator
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
rosenal referenced during the budget uh
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
in nhp2 chapter 79 Section
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
504 uh it it carry forward funds that
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
were previously appropriated um via 91
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
section 408 laws of 2021
 
00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
and it expanded the purposes for that
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
and within that was transitional housing
 
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
and part of that as a goal of reducing
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
the emergency department wait times um
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
and the the division for and and the
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
reason we were seeking that was at that
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
time was because it was I mean it was
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
more of a dynamic situation that we were
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
trying to solve and we were also rolling
 
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
out Mission zero at that time because
 
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
that Amendment uh component happened
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
during the Senate phase um which was
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
also around the time that uh litigation
 
00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
was pretty active as well so it was a
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
direct response to that so while there
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
are other funds budgeted in dbh those
 
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
have other purposes and earmarks if
 
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
you'd like I can provide um I can
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
provide you with a plan for the general
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
funds that we do have budgeted uh for
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
the other contracts if that would if
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
that would give you um a a a better
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
explanation into detail you're seeking
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
just to just to verify that it's not
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
double budgeted I that would be helpful
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
but could I follow up thank you so um
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
the the federal court order and this
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
really goes back to representative
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
Earth's question about ER boarding gave
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
the state until May of this year
 
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
to um get any individual with certified
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
iea out of the air within six hours we
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
are not yet doing that are we
 
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
we tell people waiting longer than six
 
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
hours I I'm I'm not directly involved at
 
00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
that level of detail I can certainly
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
reach out to the individuals that are
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
monitoring those those details on a
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
closer basis and give you a follow-up
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
explanation if that's helpful but I I I
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
prepared more so for the financial
 
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
component today less for the litigation
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh that I don't necessarily think I
 
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
should be commenting on you're just the
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
I've delivered uh dramatic improvements
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
in financial results operational
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
efficiency customer
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
experience um most recently I served as
 
00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
general and of grany ranch in Colorado
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
um Sim similar in size and scope to
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain Fran Con not State Park
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I'm looking forward to the
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
project presently at the mountain um
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
we're getting ready for Fall Foliage
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
coming up already the leaves are
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
starting to turn um but we're in a
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of a breather here over the
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
next 10 14 days until we see the um
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
wonderful crowds come in we're also
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
preparing for the winter and um I've
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
hired a number of key positions but
 
00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:32.039 align:start position:0%
right now we are uh Full Tilt headed
 
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
toward winter um so with that you know
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
we've submitted um our pricing uh
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the committee and
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
seeking your approval on
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
them look forward to your changes and
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
also you will find it much more colorful
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
foliage in New Hampshire having flown
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
over the mountains in Colorado they'll
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
be all green on one side and all the
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
other one another because it tends to be
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
monoculture on each side of the mountain
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
but it's not that way here
 
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
um it's difficult to read this small
 
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.470 align:start position:0%
um it's difficult to read this small
type

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
type
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
but as I understanded if you are a New
 
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire senior resident and you want
 
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
to ski at Canon on a
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
weekend and you buy your ticket online
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
you're getting a 21% price hike and if
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to the window the day you
 
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
24% price hike could you explain why
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate please sure that's
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um first of all
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
I'll couch that in terms of all of the
 
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
products um I think when I came in in
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
late March um certainly we a little bit
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
in assessment mode as we evaluate the
 
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24's budget deficit um
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
presently over the last 3 years we've
 
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
seen uh a dramatic increase in costs
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
upwards of 11% in trailing threeyear
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
average with only about a 3% growth in
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
revenues so um a pricing study was
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
conducted I looked at our demand as well
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
and so all of the products that you see
 
00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
here I factored in a number of
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
implementations to drive additional
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
revenues including to the New Hampshire
 
00:19:30.679 --> 00:19:32.430 align:start position:0%
revenues including to the New Hampshire
resident

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
resident
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
products thank you um I think I heard
 
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
they you're pretty new to the state and
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
the area um so are you aware that two
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
years ago we increased the prices on
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
seniors by about 30% so in the
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
last two three years we will have up the
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
prices for seniors to ski at a state
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
park by like
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
50% yes uh I'm I'm aware of that I think
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
what's um important to consider it's
 
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
been a part of of my study right now if
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
you can picture a particular day at the
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
mountain um only about one fth of the
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
skiers on the Hill are actually on full
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
price paid tickets and so the outcome of
 
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
that is you know Canon overall um
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
benchmarks lower than industry average
 
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
as it relates to revenue yield per skier
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
visit um the rest of the skiers on the
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
mountain on that particular day ma'am
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
are um season passholders and you know
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
split pretty evenly between season
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
passholders and then all folks who were
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
on heavily discounted programs so as I
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
was evaluating demand as I was
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
evaluating products I certainly looked
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
for areas number one um from a whole
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
love business standpoint how can we
 
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
drive additional paid ticket visitation
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
to increase our revenues and then also
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
where are some of those ways that I can
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know if if it's not just a a full
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
penalty on New Hampshire residents I I I
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to be interpreted like that
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
but what are some of the ways that we
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
can just um overall increase Revenue
 
00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:23.799 align:start position:0%
yield per ski visit and that was one of
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
the considerations to that final Follow
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
by really more of comment it just seems
 
00:21:32.909 --> 00:21:32.919 align:start position:0%
like you're doing it on the backs of
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
seniors thank
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
you Senator Bradley for a question uh
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my three sons live
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
in Steamboat you probably knew oh
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
wonderful yeah um I'm glad you're you
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
know looking at the fee structure for um
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
skiing at Canon Canon is um way under
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
price compared to other um areas in New
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and certainly Steamboat
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
Springs I believe is like $150 or
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
something like that for you know if I
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
may it's actually $300 to ski yeah so on
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
a day really congratulations um it's
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
long overdue and my understanding is
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
seniors in New Hampshire still get a
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
weekday discount that's pretty
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
significant so I congratulate you thank
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
you further questions on item 301 I have
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
one Mr chair chairman and we have
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman thank you Mr
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
chairman welcome to New Hampshire uh so
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
I was looking at the military day pass
 
00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:41.799 align:start position:0%
increase and I see that online now is
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
$58 and the advanced or online purchase
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
goes to $79 which seems rather a steep
 
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
climb for those that have served in a
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
military and a benefit that we've
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
provided for
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
years may I react um two important
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
considerations so a key implementation
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
that um uh you you'll find here in this
 
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
menu is the implementation of variable
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
pricing which is a common tactic used by
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
virtually all um ski resorts in North
 
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
America Europe Etc and what it does is
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking for opportunities to
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
increase Revenue yield per visit where
 
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
we see price more price in elastic
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
demand so on your menu you'll see um
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
standard rates and then Peak rates right
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
there on those days that I've listed
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
below those are where we see more price
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
in elastic demand and where those price
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
increases uh price tiers take um
 
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
precedence and and that's where we would
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
seek to uh boost that yield so for most
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
of the days of the year it's only about
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
20 25% of our operating days for the
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the Year military
 
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
one-day lift tickets will be $64 in
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
advance and then $84 at the window um
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
and then during those Peak period times
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
where we see the greatest demand that's
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
window further question followup thanks
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so financially how do you
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
stand it's always been a struggle to
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
make ends meet and I see you're raising
 
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.510 align:start position:0%
make ends meet and I see you're raising
about

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
$400,000 with your proposed fee
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
structure MH so how does that put us
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
financially it's a great question so
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
first of all we're working with
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
approximately about a $1.5 million
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
budget deficit from prior operating year
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
um a couple of impacts um there was a uh
 
00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
unfavorable utility contract um that
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
took place in the last two years it took
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
our uh electric rates from 7 cents a
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour to 21 cents um it had a A
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
$700,000 plus uh net negative impact on
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
the budget and that's a large
 
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
contributor um to that deficit we have
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
re renegotiated that contract or should
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
I say dis has renegotiated that to more
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
favorable terms now we're at
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
01387 so um we've already taken out um a
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
large part of that deficit upwards of
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
600 to 700,000 a year there with some of
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
the cost control methods and some of the
 
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
Contemporary best practices that I've
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
implemented we will be expected to save
 
00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
um at you know somewhere in the
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of 300 to 400,000 um in
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
costs on this particular upcoming
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
operating year and then this kind of
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
completes the puzzle on the revenue side
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
is where can I meet that next you know
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
400 500,000 to balance the budget at the
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
end of the day these are Baseline
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
figures too if there there's a real
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
correlation between
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
snowfall um and increased visitation
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
snow fall and increased yield so um I'm
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
optimistic that with a a good snow year
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
knock on wood um that uh our revenues
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
will advance Beyond this um but I think
 
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
it's a starting point from cost control
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
methods a renegotiated utility contract
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
and then targeted price increases thank
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr
 
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
chairman further from the
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
committee Senator gray uh so what you
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
said and what I heard okay what I heard
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
was we are trying to shift the uh
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
veterans and we're trying to shift the
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
elderly into a slower period of time
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
where they would get a better discount
 
00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
is that correct that would be one way of
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
interpreting it
 
00:26:47.159 --> 00:26:51.470 align:start position:0%
interpreting it
yes

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank Senator birel it's already we've
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
already got we've got a motion to
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
approve and
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
all in favor say I I oppose
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
recorded thank you it's an impressive P
 
00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:10.750 align:start position:0%
recorded thank you it's an impressive P
first

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
performance going to tab 11 got an early
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
item or late item rather but it's the
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
items number 24
 
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
298 Department of Transport
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
ation moving some money is there
 
00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
a is there a motion to
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
accept move by Senator Bradley second by
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
Senator Dallas Sandra to adopt the items
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
any further discussion seeing none all
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
in favor say I I oppose
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
no the item is adopted before we move to
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
the information items we have
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
a another group of late items that we'll
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
be discussing Senator Bradley Senator
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
greay uh I do want to talk about late
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
items before we get into the individual
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
ones uh this time I've got 12 on this
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
list and I've got one even beyond that
 
00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:19.519 align:start position:0%
and when I got these I got these
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon okay uh getting that
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
many items that short of time before
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh the meeting uh does not give the
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
senators or the representatives enough
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
time to delve into these issues as much
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
as they
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
can that does two things that either
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
says well gee we close our eyes and we
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
push the button yes you know to vote for
 
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
them or we table them and I do expect
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
that there will be a motion to table at
 
00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:55.519 align:start position:0%
least one of these items because of that
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
so the deadline for getting to the
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
committee members needs to be like noon
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
time on Wednesday for even items that
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
are going to be late except in very rare
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances and I certainly trust the
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
chair to approve those that are those
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
very rare
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances but again just as a
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
general statement that's the the feeling
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
expressed by the Senators when we met on
 
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
these items is that there's just too
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
many that are laid out items that if we
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
had gotten them like I say by noon time
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday it would have given us time
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
to interact with the commissioner on
 
00:29:40.509 --> 00:29:40.519 align:start position:0%
those items and figure out what's going
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
on I know some of the other Senators may
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
comments Senator delis thank you Mr
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
chairman I I I don't want to be the dead
 
00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:55.519 align:start position:0%
horse but indeed the senator gra has
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
made a a I think a very worthwhile
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
comment you know you know how diligent
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
we are in looking at these things and
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
get getting into these things and you
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
you know by the quality the questioning
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
that you you Reed that people do their
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
research they want to know what's what's
 
00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
going on and there are huge sums of
 
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
money that are now moving and if you if
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
you don't know where and and when and
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
how it it becomes problematic not only
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
to you but to the constituency that you
 
00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:28.039 align:start position:0%
represent and it's it's it's it's very
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
very it's very important that we get
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
these items in a timely manner uh and I
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
know it puts a heavy burden on you as
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
chair to we accept them because that's
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's the way it goes that's the way
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
this committee is
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
structured but indeed I think all
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
entities uh should be aware of the fact
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
that that late items should only be
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
considered an an urgency or an as needed
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
basis and and that's that's the key that
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
the the the success of this this
 
00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
committee because it proves that we've
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
done our worthwhile you know due
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
diligence in terms of examining these
 
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
items and and that's it's a key Adam a
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
lot of things happen here uh we spend a
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
lot of money here we appropriate a lot
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
of money here and uh I I think uh
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
knowing the full array is is very
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
important so I support Senator Senator
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
Gray's comments and uh and I I
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
understand the difficulty but indeed I
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
impress upon people that the budgets are
 
00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.909 align:start position:0%
impress upon people that the budgets are
getting

00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
bigger the items are more
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
complex uh and we don't have large
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
staffs to do research on this we do it
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
ourselves so indeed if we don't get the
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
items in a timely manner it creates a
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
problem for all of us and and I think
 
00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's problematic because we
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
want to do a good job thank you Mr chair
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Bradley uh thank you
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
very much while I agree with both of my
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
colleagues I I also want to give a shout
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
out to commissioner Caswell um the fact
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
that you know we're under and gopher is
 
00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.039 align:start position:0%
under so much pressure to get these
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
funding items funded so that we don't
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
have to give you know this money back to
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
the federal government that's where the
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
pressure is coming from so um we
 
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
obviously need as much time as you can
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
provide for us but you deserve a shout
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
out for you know making this happen too
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
so I think we just have to deal with
 
00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
what we have to deal with so anyway
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.269 align:start position:0%
thank you
Taylor

00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
Taylor
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
further the blame lies with me when I
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
get requests for late items I almost
 
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
always accept
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
them This was later than usual
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
but when I'm looking at arpa items which
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
we've all dealt with there's very few of
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
them that we really find fault with
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
because we know that these things are
 
00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:54.519 align:start position:0%
shifting all the time he's he's going
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
through thousands of requests all the
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
time he's full-time reviewing all these
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
things and seeing which one is most
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
deserving and he does a pretty good job
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
of bringing us the ones that we would
 
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
probably all approve of but we're going
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
to see another pile next month because
 
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
that's a deadline and so I thought it
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
would seem better to try get some of
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
them out of the way this meeting because
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
I know we'll see more in October and
 
00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully we will have a little more
 
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:23.720 align:start position:0%
time but again he's right up against the
 
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
deadline he's gotten information at the
 
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
last minute well we can't spend this
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
because we got disapproved for that and
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
so things are churning all the time and
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
and I was just trying to be helpful uh I
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
know I put all of us under some strain
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
but I thought you know if we could look
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
at it the night before and and still
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
have a good idea that it would be a good
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
idea to get them out of the way in
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
September before we get another slew in
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
October I apologize for the strain has
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
put anybody on so if I could just add to
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
that no apology necessary you deserve a
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
sh out too so I mean you're doing what
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
you have to do as chair and I appreciate
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
you representative um and then
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
Senator yeah I I I just want to say as a
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
former Army budget officer at the end of
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
every fiscal year there's a a a crisis
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
in trying to make sure that you obligate
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
all the money so I appreciate the stress
 
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
that this uh this these programs have uh
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
created in order to get the communic
 
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
ation and the and the approvals needed
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
so so I do appreciate that I I just
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
would ask that uh in the in the hurry
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
and the rush of the days to come in
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
particular that we maintain a sharp
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
discipline as sharp as possible around
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
using this one-time money for one-time
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
Investments and not go the easy route to
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
slip some of this money into uh ongoing
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
operations because uh there's going to
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
be a bill to pay for that in the coming
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
years if we if we artificially feed
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
operations now with one-time money so so
 
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
that would be my encouragement is to at
 
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
the working level maintain that
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
discipline onetime money for one-time
 
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
expenses thank you Senator G I just want
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
to go back and and clarify if I'm not
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to late items themselves but
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
when we get a late item if you get it
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
after say noon time the senators get it
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
after noon time on Wednesday that is
 
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
when we generally review these things
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
and have the uh comments uh given to LBA
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
who can interact with the agencies and
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
get us back the thing okay so there is a
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
big difference between receiving the
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
item at noon time on Wednesday and
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
receiving the item o Dark 30 on Thursday
 
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
okay there's a a big difference when
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
research that you can do and questions
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
that you can ask to be able to do that
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
so it's not that we're opposed to all
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
the late
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
items okay and there are going to be
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
ones that come in even Friday morning
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
but we need to keep those to the
 
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%
minimum and give us the time to research
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
the ones that so when I look at the list
 
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
of 12 I won't go to the 13th one but if
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
we look at the list of 12 how many of
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
those could we have actually had
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
Wednesday at noon time so again just all
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
right for what it's worth I didn't
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
realize that you were meeting that early
 
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
this week in the future for October they
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
will not be accepted after noon on
 
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
Wednesday for late items
 
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
so anything
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%

says this is the first of its
 
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.390 align:start position:0%
says this is the first of its
kind

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
kind
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
um living arrangement in the
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
state but um there is a contract with an
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
organization called Community Options
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
that operates 10 homes or 12 in New
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire three of which are in nashwa
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
four individuals with develop mental
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities so I'm not
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
sure how this is different that makes it
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
the first of its
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
kind um well I would have to say that um
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
I can't confirm that it's the first of
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
its kind that would be something that we
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
certainly went back and forth with uh
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the or this organization
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
and that was information we get so there
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
might be some distinction that I am not
 
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
familiar enough with to speak to today
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
but um I guess I would just put asterisk
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
nness to that statement perhaps my
 
00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:09.230 align:start position:0%
nness to that statement perhaps my
Nathan

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
no um I I I I do not know the nature of
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
the request or the specific project
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
that's planned but you you are correct
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
we we have a $3.2 million contract with
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
Community Options for uh 32 beds in the
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
state currently that's active um but I I
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
don't know the specifics of this program
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to differentiate what's
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
unique about it we'd have to go back and
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
just verify that okay thank
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
you further questions move the item
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosell
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
moves it's already been done very good
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
all right all in favor say I oppose no
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
319 information
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
technology and any questions on this
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
item Senator rosenal has a question yes
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
thank you it's my day to ask questions
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
um and we see Mr Gay taking seat good
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
morning um Mr chair uh members of the
 
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
committee Dennis goule commissioner of
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Information Technology
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning morning we we
 
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
do have a healthc care
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
Workforce problem in New Hampshire and
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
um we've looked did various
 
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:32.559 align:start position:0%
efforts to increase the pipeline of
 
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
people entering Health
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
Professions um from programs in Middle
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
starting in middle schools to rural
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
residencies towards more training for
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners lots of ways to
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
increase the health care
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce and also we always look to
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
bring new doctors in
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is that um I'm
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
looking at the last paragraph on page
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
two which says the solution to this
 
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
backlog is to implement a new more
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
effective licensing
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
system and it's really more of a comment
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
I I mean I think this is good and it
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
will help but I think it' be naive of us
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
to think this is going to solve our
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
health care Workforce problem because
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of different things we
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
need to do this is one and it's good and
 
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
I fully support it but um I hope we're
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
not getting the public to think that by
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
making the software work faster we're
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
going to get people faster doctors
 
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
appointments or faster entry into
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment or mental health
 
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
treatment because I I don't think this
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
is the solution to that P I would agree
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
with that and and I I think the intent
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
of that comment and and I I apologize if
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
it wasn't clear it was the intent was
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
more around um the the accuracy and
 
00:44:27.549 --> 00:44:27.559 align:start position:0%
timeliness um and accountability of the
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
process by which we vet and adjudicate
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
those those
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
applications uh that's we we intend to
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
to solve that or improve that a lot um
 
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
and I you know I've heard feedback
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
directly from individuals on the
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
experience and it's and sometimes it's
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
not as good as it could be and then
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's what we you know the experience
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
of actually getting licensed and that's
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
further

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
discussion okay I don't believe we have
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.400 align:start position:0%

00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
understanding of the four projects and
 
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
the amounts Lake Massabesic for $3
 
00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:51.079 align:start position:0%
million to raise the level of the lake
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
um which will obviously help the entire
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
water system of Southern New Hampshire
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
um $1.5 million for London der's water
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
planning that will um help the
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund save that money
 
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
$1.5 million for a uh water system in
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
Bartlet that has been the subject of
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
litigation for a long period of time and
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
then I believe it's
 
00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:21.559 align:start position:0%
$109,000 for um a pump unit in the town
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
of Hudson you are correct those are the
 
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.829 align:start position:0%
of Hudson you are correct those are the
four

00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%

item uh we put a lot of focus on water
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I think all of us
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:44.079 --> 00:47:45.790 align:start position:0%

further Iain a motion to adopt it's
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
already been done done okay all in favor
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
say I I oppose no item is adopted moving
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%

question all right seeing none we'll

pass over that because we don't need to
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
vote on it and the last item I show is
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%

sections the first section is the
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
management letter section prepared by
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
the Auditors and it contains our report
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
on internal control and compliance along
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
with three audit observations which are
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
Then followed by the current status of
 
00:51:22.109 --> 00:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
Prior audit
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
findings the second section the
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
financial section contains our
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
independent Auditor's report followed by
 
00:51:29.549 --> 00:51:29.559 align:start position:0%
the treasury prepared financial
 
00:51:30.789 --> 00:51:30.799 align:start position:0%
statements and
 
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:33.559 align:start position:0%
notes the focus of my presentation today
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
will be on the observations and
 
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations however we would be
 
00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you may
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
have on any part of this
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
report if you turn to the table of
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
contents you will note that the three
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
observations contained in the report are
 
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
all internal control observations none
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
of which are considered to be material
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
weaknesses we did not identify any
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
observations related to State compliance
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
and treasury concurred with all three of
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
observations turning to page three we
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
included a table to summarize the
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations as requested by the
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee we have noted here that none
 
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
of the observations are identified as
 
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
suggesting that legislative action may
 
00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.190 align:start position:0%
suggesting that legislative action may
be

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
required the observations begin on page
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
four with observation number one which
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
recommends the treasury continue to
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
improve the record keeping for its
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
off-book accounts and prioritize
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
migrating the accounts to the state
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
accounting system the total balance of
 
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
the accounts at June 30th 2023 was
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
approximately $61
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
million these accounts are largely
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
accounted for on Excel spreadsheets
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
which increases the risk of error and
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
fraud as spreadsheets do not allow for
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
the robust control framework which is
 
00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
inherent in general ledger accounting
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
systems such as the state system New
 
00:52:45.119 --> 00:52:47.510 align:start position:0%
systems such as the state system New
Hampshire

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
first observation number two notes the
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
debt management system used by treasury
 
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
during fiscal year 2023 was limited in
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
functionality was outdated was not
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
supported by the vendor requiring
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
significant staff attention to ensure
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
debt schedules were
 
00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
accurate treasury entered into a
 
00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:05.559 align:start position:0%
contract with a new vendor for a
 
00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
replacement system in May of 2024 and we
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
recommend that treasury work with this
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
new vendor to ensure the new system
 
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
needs observation number three on page
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
six recommends the treasury adopt
 
00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures to document the
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of key employees in
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
order to provide for reasonable
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
continuity of operations in the event of
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
turnover moving to page 99 the appendix
 
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:37.720 align:start position:0%

of course they were very patient with us
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
while they were trying to um um they
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
were waiting for information from us um
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh for their audit so I want to thank
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%

like to uh start um you may all recall I
 
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
was once an LBA AUD so um I have uh um a
 
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
lot of respect for for the office and
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
the work that U mik um and his team uh
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
and everyone generates for the state the
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
state is very fortunate to to have the
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
Oba um and to have that work that they
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
that they did they produce for the state
 
00:55:47.069 --> 00:55:47.079 align:start position:0%
um so uh the the other thing I want to
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
say is once uh about 10 years ago uh I
 
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
was sit and Collins uh chair I had the
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to lead the audit of the
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
last audit of the treasury
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
and um at the time it was when uh
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
treasure preventure was moving on and
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
and treasure d uh was uh uh stepping in
 
00:56:08.349 --> 00:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
into that role and um I had the honor to
 
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
he he asked me to to be his uh deputy
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
and I had the honor to to join the
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
treasury um treasure DW was very
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
committed to resolve all of the
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
observations and one of my first
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
assignments was to work on all of those
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
observations so I'm very pleased to
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
report that we we resolved all of them
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
except for one and and that last one is
 
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
included in this report and it's
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
observation number one um so so with
 
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
that what I want to say is if I may Mr
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
chair I would like to just uh briefly go
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
over the
 
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
observations um so the first one uh um I
 
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
could say a lot of things where we
 
00:56:44.829 --> 00:56:44.839 align:start position:0%
haven't um migrated all those accounts
 
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
to the accounting system but um what I
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
can what I would like to focus on today
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
is is really um that we uh to tell you
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
that we do have a plan to migrate him as
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
you all know the the the state is is
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
going through the process to uh to
 
00:57:01.029 --> 00:57:01.039 align:start position:0%
upgrade uh the current accounting system
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to the cloud and so as part of
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
that new functionality uh that will be
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
available uh there's a there's a a
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
component of that new system that will
 
00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:14.839 align:start position:0%
have a module that will have um it has a
 
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:16.839 align:start position:0%
dedicated space for thep these types of
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
accounts trust accounts so our intent is
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
to uh to migrate all those accounts uh
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
take the advantage of the full uh full
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
functionality uh Tak full uh advantage
 
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
of that functionality uh and again
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
migrate those accounts and and finally
 
00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
um record and and and have the corporate
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
accounting for for this for this
 
00:57:40.109 --> 00:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
accounts in in the accounting system so
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
we are mindful of all of those risk and
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
we have implemented controls to uh again
 
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
try to mitigate in the potential risk
 
00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
that manual accounting um creates uh so
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
again we're mindful of that risk and we
 
00:57:55.029 --> 00:57:55.039 align:start position:0%
have a plan to to um to resolve that to
 
00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
to resolve that issue
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh the second observation I'm very very
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
pleased to say that we consider that
 
00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
fully resolved we have implemented a new
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
debt management system uh as so as we
 
00:58:07.789 --> 00:58:07.799 align:start position:0%
understand that system has um robust
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
internal controls we already using that
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
functionality we are um already using
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
the reports for um for the work that we
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
um provide for the preparation of the
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
financial statements for the AER and
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're also already use n for projections
 
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
for our budget de service projections so
 
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable with that um of of
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
course just needs to go through the the
 
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:29.559 align:start position:0%
process of being audited by the external
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
Auditors KPMG is going to look at that
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
um but again we're we're we're confident
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
and and I'm confident that uh we're
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
going to see a positive outcome and and
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
certainly the state we are in a much
 
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
better position today than we were uh
 
00:58:44.029 --> 00:58:44.039 align:start position:0%
before we had this
 
00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
system and the last observation um uh we
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
completely concur with the Auditors we
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
agree we need to have more to
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
documentation not only for what um our
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
lead uh and our key employees produce
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
but also so for uh core functions of a
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
treasury um it is um it is a real risk
 
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
to um the fact that when I look at my
 
00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
staff I can see uh many retirements in
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
the future in the near future and so it
 
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's something that we're mindful
 
00:59:15.549 --> 00:59:15.559 align:start position:0%
of and and we are not only uh this is of
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
course this is part of the solution to
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
have more documentation but also um our
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
goal is to continue to review the
 
00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
structure our structure our processes to
 
00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:26.839 align:start position:0%
ensure that we maintain a resilient
 
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
treasuries a treasury that can survive
 
00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
all of us um so um again we'll we're
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
we'll be mindful we are mindful of this
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
risk we continue we continue to um uh
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
create uh more do documentation as as
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
recommended by the otter and obviously
 
00:59:45.029 --> 00:59:45.039 align:start position:0%
that work will be ongoing and so we U
 
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
we're committed to continue that work
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
and um the last thing I want to say is I
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
want I really want to thank my staff um
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%

internal controls to to make sure we are
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh internal controls over um financial
 
01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:29.480 align:start position:0%

01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
you questions representative Edwards and
 
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
then Senator D you know thank you for
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
this thank you for the audit uh I I'm
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I I'm focusing on the the third
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation about improving the
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
documentation of key
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to me that's been
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
critical in every role I've ever had to
 
01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
be very clear on who was doing what and
 
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
but I but I understand documentation can
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
get out of date so what I'm really
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
interested in is you're you're
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
describing the environment in which your
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
agency is operating are you operating an
 
01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:18.039 align:start position:0%
environment in which the uh rate of
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
change is so great that it's difficult
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
to keep the documentation current or are
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
you operating in environment where these
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
documents just um Drew in attention that
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
that you just assumed what they said
 
01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:38.039 align:start position:0%
rather than reusing them at annual
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
performance updates
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
reviews thank you for the question
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative um so so you are
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct documentation can get
 
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
sailed very quickly and that's one of
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
the challenges I think um what we are um
 
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
what we again thinking about how we're
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
going to approach this and there are
 
01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
some key key key pieces that we can
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
focus on uh um so for example uh believe
 
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
it or not there is no not a job
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
description of the treasurer so we're
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
going to start with you know key
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
components of documentation things that
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
are um you know you will consider um
 
01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
critical any in any organization so um
 
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
organization started to change um a
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
little more again we're going to go
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
through uh a whole um upgrade of the
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
accounting system the work that the
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
treasury does relies on that system to
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
reconcile accounts to to receive uh
 
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
reports so um for over 15 years has been
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
about the same and so now we're looking
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
at our structure and trying to um again
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
trying to see what the future is going
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
to look like in a year or two and um and
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
you actually you you there are some
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
changes you may see in the budget
 
01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
process in order to prepare for some of
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
those um some of those um changes that
 
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
we're seeing and again trying to prepare
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
for uh what we see as the treasury of
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
the future so so we're going to again so
 
01:02:59.470 --> 01:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to um document key
 
01:03:03.309 --> 01:03:03.319 align:start position:0%
pieces but it is um but you're correct I
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
think that think the challenge is going
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
to be try to keep up with that
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
documentation as we see the treasure
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
transition as we see the state uh
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
changing their environment technology
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
needs to drive what we do a lot of the
 
01:03:17.549 --> 01:03:17.559 align:start position:0%
processes that we do are very manual we
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
rely on institutional knowledge of some
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
key employees um and and we just said
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
they're about to retire so we need to
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
revisit all of that and rely a little
 
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
more on um technology and then document
 
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
procedures based on those uh again what
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
around that technology and the key
 
01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
functions of the treasury so um I'm not
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
sure if that answers your question I
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
think I think the the key the challenge
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
is going to be to stay current um but
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
also um again we want to move forward to
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about how the future is going
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
to look like uh and and just um update
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
those procedures as as as we change
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
so so what I think I heard you say is
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of both that there was
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
the environmentally there was a little
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
bit of a lack of attention to the
 
01:04:08.269 --> 01:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
documentation but more more importantly
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
as you go forward and you're innovating
 
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
at the the agency that that you have a
 
01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
proactive requirement to to adapt to the
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
Technologies and the procedures and and
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
then clarify job roles as you manage
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
your change process that is is correct
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
and and so we do have a lot of
 
01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
documentation of different things but
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
there perhaps and this is what the audit
 
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
the audit focused on is is to document
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
key key Concepts key procedures key key
 
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
things that are not documented so we're
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
going to focus on that and again try to
 
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
identify what it is that is critical
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
that we need to have documentation
 
01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
on senator delandra for question Mr
 
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
Chief first of all mon I want to commend
 
01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
you for a magnificent job I I look at
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
the focus every month and let me tell
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
you something this budgets balanced by
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
interest income and your management of
 
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
those funds makes that happen and I
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
Kudos that I've been around here for a
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
long time I remember when Bob Flanders
 
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
was our Treasurer now I'm probably the
 
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
only one around this table who remembers
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
B plan is maybe
 
01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
uh okay here Jane does but uh and I used
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
to deal with him on a daily basis uh I
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
think the job you've done is terrific
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
uh as I say just people look at the
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
focus every month look at what's
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
happened look at that bottom line number
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
and you know that we're in Balance
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
because of that so kudos to the work
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
you've done and I think the thing that
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
we all should be cognizant of is the
 
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
number of retirees that will be
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
happening uh in the near future and
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
we've got to replace these retirees with
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
with very capable very competent people
 
01:05:55.269 --> 01:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
and that's a tough job and uh that's a
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
very very difficult to do but uh it's
 
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an ominous responsibility
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
the retirements will be uh will be uh
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
something to look at and then you had a
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
tragedy in your office a person passed
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
away un very unexpectedly you had to
 
01:06:14.269 --> 01:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
deal with that and and you did so Kudos
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
and I haven't seen an audit report as
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
good at this in a long time where where
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
all of the things are addressed so uh so
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
that Michael Kane must be a Dynamo with
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
the put putting the pressure on
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
but uh that's that's really magnificent
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
it is wonderful to see that to get a
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
report where everything has been done
 
01:06:35.269 --> 01:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
and you you can't be that's good
 
01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
government at work so kudos for that
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%

did the achievment process that was
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
wonderful that made the difference in my
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%

we've been fortunate to to to for a
 
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
period of time to have a very strong C
 
01:07:04.589 --> 01:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh cash balance so uh and obviously
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
uh interest rates have helded so that uh
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
we we definitely took advantage of that
 
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh time uh times are going to change uh
 
01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
but we we feel like we are um positioned
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%

for some time so um as we've been here
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%

01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
15 I think the I'm trying to look and
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
see when Thanksgiving
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
comes it's 28 28 so it's quite a few
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
days later and it'd be the it' be two
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
weeks later that we'd
 
01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.790 align:start position:0%
weeks later that we'd
have

01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.470 align:start position:0%
have
Thanksgiving

01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
so it it would be difficult to move it
 
01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
later possibly earlier but
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
that kind of puts a cramp on things
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
October I expect as I announced we'll
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
have the the final on the arpa hopefully
 
01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:05.800 align:start position:0%

uh and uh
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%

01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
