criminal
 
00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
justice anyway this bill was put forward
 
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure there's transparent Arcy
 
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
and local police
 
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
investigations two instances I will
 
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
mention here one is a vehicle fatality
 
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
case that happened in der a motorcycle
 
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
with two people and a car were involved
 
00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
in the accident and two people on the
 
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
motorcycle were killed there's a lot of
 
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
disagreement as to who was at fault
 
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
heard some testimony of the car crossed
 
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
the double line another that the
 
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
motorcycle was speeding to catch up with
 
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.390 align:start position:0%
motorcycle was speeding to catch up with
their

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
group at first the report was that the
 
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
motorcycles at fault then I believe the
 
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
fin report that there is an was an
 
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
accident no one in that fault I also
 
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
heard that the town of dery also had the
 
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester police investigate and they
 
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
came up with the same conclusion and
 
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
one the insurance companies paid
 
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
settlements against the car driver
 
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
insurance companies paying out that's
 
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
the dairy Police Department is under a
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
lot of scrutiny because of this if this
 
00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
happen in a small town the state police
 
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
could investigate and understand that
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
they have a unit that does this
 
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
investigate vehicle fatalities for towns
 
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
or cities that don't have their own unit
 
00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
another case where this bill is needed
 
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
when I was a selectman some decades ago
 
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
there was an incident where town
 
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
department head appeared to have some
 
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
monetary issues we couldn't have our
 
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
local police investigate because the
 
00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 align:start position:0%
then police chief was having an affair
 
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
with that department head it would have
 
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
been nice to have that
 
00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
investigated what this bill does is have
 
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 align:start position:0%
the governing body selectman or town
 
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
counsel or County attorney or County
 
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 align:start position:0%
Sheriff get the state police to
 
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
investigate should be noted in like in
 
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
my town of litfield the state police
 
00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
would investigate because we're a small
 
00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
town so it they have a unit that does
 
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
this I doubt that there would need to be
 
00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
a financial note State Police now
 
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
investig at Murders set investigate
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
fatality in small town and that number
 
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
is fluid they know I no no one knows how
 
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
many and I doubt the instances would not
 
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
be that much and why would any
 
00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 align:start position:0%
Department be against another set of
 
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
eyes to
 
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
investigate as a former city manager
 
00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
said to me if someone objects what are
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
they trying to hide also in this I have
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
an amendment the name was spelled wrong
 
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
so it's a one on line Amendment and I
 
00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
asked ol do I need an amendment for a
 
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
misspelt word and they said yes so also
 
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
included is the
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
um uh a member of the family that did in
 
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
sort of their own investigation and
 
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
investigate a bunch of emails
 
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
investigate the different um departments
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
and sent emails as to what was said so
 
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.070 align:start position:0%
and sent emails as to what was said so
with

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
that I'll end my in my
 
00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you representative so
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
basically what what this bill is doing
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
is just Al is basically allowing for
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
another department or the state the
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
state police could you just
 
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
right so to have another Police
 
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
Department investigate if something well
 
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
the state police do investigate State
 
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you right well as
 
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
they do in small towns and whatnot
 
00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
anyway okay
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
Muse could you just explain a little bit
 
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
more about uh what the circumstances
 
00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
were around the dairy incident that led
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
you to file the bill well the the point
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
was it as far as I know and I didn't
 
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
watch any of the videos or anything so
 
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just hey if I was there was a
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
motorcycle I believe going around the
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
circle motorc a bunch of motorcyclists
 
00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
going around the circle in Dairy and uh
 
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
I guess the last one was the ones in
 
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
this incident or next to the last if I
 
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
remember correctly and the car had
 
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
pulled out and hit the
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist now was the motorcyclist
 
00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
speeding I don't know did the car cross
 
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
go through a red light red I mean stop
 
00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
sign or across a double line I don't
 
00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 align:start position:0%
know those are just stories that I've
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
heard I wasn't there so I can't really
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
say but the thing is it's just hey with
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
all the pressure going on against the
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
dairy Police Department I think this
 
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
would have been the right thing to do at
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
that time know just put another eye set
 
00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
of eyes on it in the future so that
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
could happen if something like that
 
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.430 align:start position:0%
could happen if something like that
happened

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
again representative you recognized for
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
followup but let's
 
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
um there's definitely been an
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
investigation done so we just want to
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
try to to leave those details out and
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
just stick all right I I'll hold off
 
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
till then okay thank you represent Stone
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question so just to clarify
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
does your bill Target really uh police
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
misconduct or is it no it's just a
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
another a separate eyes looking at a
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
situation and in some cases like for
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
example if I was a police chief and
 
00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 align:start position:0%
something like this happened in my town
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
I would welcome hey I don't want the
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
pressure let's have a a another set of
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
eyes looking at this to come up with the
 
00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
conclusion that won't show any bias
 
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
against my Police Department or the town
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
followup isn't that alleging Miss
 
00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:39.909 align:start position:0%
followup isn't that alleging Miss
conduct

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
no no I mean if I was like I said I
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
would want another set of eyes like uh
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
the city man former city manager had
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
said to me hey if somebody's against
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
another set of eyes looking at
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
something then if they're hiding
 
00:07:59.149 --> 00:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
something but hey if another I believe
 
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
they in this case they had Manchester
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
look at it but you know that's another
 
00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
police department but this they having
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
the state police look at it might come
 
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
up they might come up with the same
 
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:08.919 align:start position:0%
answer they might come up with a
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
different answer but it's not misconduct
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's just having another set of eyes
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
looking at things so you're seeking
 
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
validation what you're seeking
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
validation it just may be a validation
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
or an invalid I mean we don't know
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's why my bill says a separate
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
investigation to come up with a separate
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
anything any further
 
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative Murphy oh thank
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
so would this U be a request that
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
anybody that had concerns about the
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
outcome of or the determination of a
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
police department that the next step
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
would automatically be the request made
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
to a a town government um and entity um
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
so that state police would be step two I
 
00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
mean in this it's the situation you're
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
talking about sounds like um you there
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
were two investigations the first one by
 
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
Derry and the second one by Manchester
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
so your your suggestion would be it
 
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
would not be another Police Department
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
it would just be the state police right
 
00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
the thing is it's not anybody it's the
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
Town Council or Selectmen depending on
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
the town uh the city county attorney or
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
the county sheriff
 
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
it's not just anybody and it's for in
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
past thank you um
 
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
so are there any criteria upon which the
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
that second investigation would be um is
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
it just like if somebody disagrees with
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
the findings of a police department they
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
have a question this would be for the
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
findings but my bill says you know if
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
you think there's going to be you know
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
not before yeah if you think there going
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
to be an issue then the county attorney
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
or the county sheriff or the Town
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
Council and for example in this case if
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
I was the police chief and seeing
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a problem I would go
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
to My Town Council and say hey get the
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
state police to do it be that way I
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
don't have a my Police Department is not
 
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
put under any pressure which they are
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
now with press and
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I just I'm trying
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
to clarify based on on what you've
 
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
answered so this would this be for any
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
matter like I mean I I represent Durham
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
and we often have uh incidences of
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
people being uh significantly inebriated
 
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
and needing things and and they often
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
challenge that so if someone were to
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
persuade a council
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
member would that then be subject to
 
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
State investigation for review I'm I'm
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where the the guard
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
rails are to stop it being from every
 
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
incident to the ones that are relevant
 
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
limiting it to like the Town Council or
 
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
selectman can request the city county
 
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
attorney or the county sheriff so it's
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
limited to not just anybody so it's get
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
they have to agree with you so it's not
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
going to be open to anything that's why
 
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
I said it's not going to be that and the
 
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
case in litfield what happened was we
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't have an investigation
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
Newman and just to clarify when it says
 
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
the municipal body or request from the
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
municipal body would then be um a result
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
of a vote by the governing body to
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
determine to do that it's not just one
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
individual on the governing body okay
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
thank you well it could be the County
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
Attorney as one individual or the county
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
sheriff other than the people named
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
individually for a governing body it
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
would not just be an individual sorry
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
about the followup
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question doesn't the
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
County Attorney already have the ability
 
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
to initiate a review of any criminal or
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh cases that go before their office
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
they can review but they don't have the
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
Manpower and and whatnot to do an an
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
investigation this way would get the
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
unit that normally does those
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
investigations do the investigation like
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
year I did not do anything the first
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
month it was Mother's Day the first time
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
that I asked the PD what was going on
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
investigation and I got lied to and told
 
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.310 align:start position:0%
investigation and I got lied to and told
horrible

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
horrible
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
things we've never dealt with the law of
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
my family ever so this is our first
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
experience ever with any type of L
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:59.790 align:start position:0%
experience ever with any type of L
agency

00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
so when I left I called back and asked
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
can I have a copy of the meeting that we
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
just had and he said well no there is no
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
video which didn't make sense so I
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
called the Town
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
Administrator to be screamed at and told
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
he stands by his police department and
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
hung up the
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
phone I then called The Town Council and
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
spoke with Aaron I believe her name
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
was after I spoke with her about an hour
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
later Lieutenant Breen called and said
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
oh we have the video but sorry there's
 
00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:41.790 align:start position:0%
oh we have the video but sorry there's
no

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
audio and that was that so it just you
 
00:14:49.749 --> 00:14:49.759 align:start position:0%
have the paperwork it spiraled I did I I
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
tried to go you know I went to the Town
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
Administrator I went to the town
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
counselor this woman I asked them
 
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
to get someone else to do the
 
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
investigation she was a a longtime
 
00:15:05.749 --> 00:15:05.759 align:start position:0%
social worker in the town of Derry for
 
00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:08.839 align:start position:0%
12 years which works very closely with
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
the police department and the court
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
system they refused Manchester did not
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
do a full investigation they did an
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
accident reconstruction only to find out
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
the speed of the motorcycle and I will
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
tell you Adam was speeding he
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
was but the lady failed to yield she
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
crossed a double line into their Lane on
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
a straight
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
away and they hit them and
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
died they protected these people to the
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
hilt she that on the scene they wrote a
 
00:15:47.949 --> 00:15:47.959 align:start position:0%
ticket that she failed to
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
yield somehow they took that off she
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
didn't even get a ticket they told me
 
00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:54.759 align:start position:0%
she had no
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
fault I did a report with the
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.110 align:start position:0%
fault I did a report with the
doj

00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
doj
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
because I just couldn't believe that
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
that's how somebody in uniform would act
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
the way they were treating
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
us so I did a report to the doj and I
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
got an email back saying if you hav't
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
problems with the chief of police deal
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
with the county
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
attorney okay so I then had my attorney
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
send two letters to the county attorney
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
requesting a meeting to talk about the
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
police department's actions
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
and how they treated us and the lying
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
that was going
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
on the first letter she completely
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
ignored the second
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
letter we got a call my lawyer got a
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
call from the victim Advocate
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
Callahan who set up a meeting which we
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
thought was to talk about the police
 
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.350 align:start position:0%
thought was to talk about the police
department's

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
department's
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
Behavior instead she had the police
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
chief there advocated for him and they
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
advocated for the woman that was driving
 
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.189 align:start position:0%
advocated for the woman that was driving
the

00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
car so when we got home he called the
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
doj said who sent this email could I
 
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
talk to whoever told me to do this cuz
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
nothing got addressed oh no one signed
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
the email we don't know I have that
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
email no one
 
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.470 align:start position:0%
email no one
knows

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
knows
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
I'm disgusted at how this all went cuz
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense one in one need to
 
00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
make two I got paid out a lot of money I
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
mean hundreds of thousands of dollars
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
the operator of the motorcycle got paid
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
out hundreds of thousands of dollars the
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
other person that dropped their bike got
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
paid out but yet they said she has no
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
fault they even took the ticket off like
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
my daughter didn't matter and I assure
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
you she mattered a lot to all of our
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
family I I just I'm at with end at this
 
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
point I did
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
another investigation with the doj
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
asking who sent the email what's going
 
00:18:10.149 --> 00:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
on nobody wants to address it that's
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
still going on today it's as far as
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday was the last emails we have
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
going she was a social worker in the
 
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%

for killing two kids she C a double
 
00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
yellow line they should have passed the
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
case that somebody could have been
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
objective somebody that hadn't worked
 
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
with her they could have done the right
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
thing I
 
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
just I feel like my whole family was
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
completely failed by the
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
state and we have never ever been any
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
pressure on the system I have a great
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
kids I don't know that's that's about
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
the side this is New Hampshire this is

where I raised my family and this is
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%

00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
would hope that I can sleep through the
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%

00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%

allenberg

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
maybe morning chairman Roy and members
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Alan Alder
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
murg I'm the chief of police in
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester I'm currently the current
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
president of the Hampshire Association
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
of chiefs of
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
police I too offer my condolences to the
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
family I'm very tragic situation but
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I I come before you today
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
to express our opposition to House Bill
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
1566 this is amendment is unnecessary in
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
my opinion has significant potential to
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
create an undue burden on New Hampshire
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
State Police resources that are already
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
stretched thin from unprecedented
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
challenges and retention and recruitment
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
in the law enforcement Community I also
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
believe this amendment could be harmful
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
to the Integrity of of criminal
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
investigations and possibly result in
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
the unfair impeachment of witnesses who
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
may end up being interviewed twice as
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
part of two separate and independent
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
investigations first of all why do I
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
feel the am the amendment is unnecessary
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
because there's already an effective
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place to address perceived
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in investigations performed
 
00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
by local police
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
departments if a victim feels that their
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
local police department did not perform
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
its due due diligence in investigating a
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
criminal matter currently they have the
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
option of working with either the public
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
Integrity unit at the Attorney General's
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
office or directly with their County
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
Attorney's Office to have the
 
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.909 align:start position:0%
Attorney's Office to have the
investigation

00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
reviewed if upon review new
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
investigative Avenues are uncovered the
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
local police department are responsible
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
for pursuing those Avenues I believe
 
00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:32.919 align:start position:0%
that is misguided to shunt that
 
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the state police as
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
this would inevitably create a
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
bottleneck in delaying the UN delay the
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
timely administration of justice local
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
police department investigators are more
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
than capable of
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
Performing followup recommended
 
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations by the county attorney's
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
office or the Attorney General's office
 
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
these detectives and investigators have
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
been certified by the same Police
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
Academy that St State Police
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
investigators attend and they often
 
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
attend the same inservice investigative
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
training in courses as their state
 
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.909 align:start position:0%
training in courses as their state
police

00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:06.799 align:start position:0%
counterparts there is no reason to have
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
State Police investigators essentially
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
redo a local police department's
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
investigation based upon a simple
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
request and nothing else doing so would
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
duplicate efforts and be a waste of
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
resources in its current form h HP
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
1566 does not require any specific
 
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
criteria to be met before bringing in
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
State Police
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.630 align:start position:0%
State Police
investigators

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
furthermore a potential unintended
 
00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
consequence of this legislation is that
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police ends up
 
00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:35.919 align:start position:0%
reinvestigating every high-profile case
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
from across the state whether or not the
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
local police department performed
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
thorough and thoughtful investigations
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
this could end up being the default as
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
local leaders seek the perception that
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
they have done all they possibly can for
 
00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
victims by requesting a complete
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
reinvestigation of these matters by the
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
state police it could become routine
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire that in every
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
instance that local police failure to to
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
make an arrest in a high-profile matter
 
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
the leaders in the local municipalities
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
automatically request the interv
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
intervention of State Police for cover
 
00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
with no consideration as to whether or
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
not the local police department
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
performed their due diligence this would
 
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
be a terrible waste of resources and one
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
that tax prayers of the Hampshire should
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
not have to bear lastly and perhaps most
 
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
importantly this amendment is harmful to
 
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of criminal investigations
 
00:24:24.389 --> 00:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
and that it could create false
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
perceptions related to The credibility
 
00:24:28.269 --> 00:24:28.279 align:start position:0%
of witnesses by acquiring the state
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
police conduct separate and independent
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
investigation if a witness is
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
interviewed twice by two separate
 
00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
agencies about the same matter with one
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
interview taking place days after the
 
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
incident and another taking place weeks
 
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
or months after the same incident it is
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
quite possible that the witness could
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
give slightly different accounts in each
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
of the two
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
interviews this is why criminal
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
investigators typically do not interview
 
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
the same witness multiple times about
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
the same thing because a defense
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
attorney could later exploit these
 
00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
differences in statements to try to
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
impeach the witness is my opinion this
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
could be yet another unintended
 
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
consequence of this proposed legislation
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
I ask you to consider this last question
 
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
what is the recourse if one is not
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the investigation as
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
completed by the Hampshire State
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
Police where do they
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
go in conclusion and for the reasons
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned I urge you not to support
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill although I am
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
sure that the sponsor of this amendment
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
has the best intentions we think that in
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
its current form this legislation is
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
highly problematic I'm happy to take any
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
questions you
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
have chairman Roy thank you thank you
 
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
Chief um I have a question
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
regarding things that can be done to
 
00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039 align:start position:0%
avoid the appearance of impropriety so
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
is it possible under the current law if
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
a police chief or the Town Administrator
 
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
whoever is over the police chief sees a
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
case come up that there could be some
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
conflict does the chief or the town have
 
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
the option of requesting an outside
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
investigation before they start rather
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
than repeating another investigation I
 
00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
do that now chairman um I can tell you
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
in 2023 I think I conflicted out three
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
cases to the New Hampshire State Police
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
that my officers detectives
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
investigators didn't touch it came to
 
00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
our attention we recognized immediate
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
conflict and we conflict out the state
 
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
police is there any rule that you're
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
aware of um or any common procedure
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
across the state for that or is it based
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
on just your individual take at the time
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
I well it's for me it's governed by
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
policy uh best practices um and if you
 
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
have any sense that you're going to have
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
a conflict with a case I immediately
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
will contact my County attorney and
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
explain what we have um and you take it
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
a step further um we conflict it out to
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
State Police when they issue their
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
findings my County attorney generally
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
then will conflict out to another County
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
attorney for them to look at the
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
findings to decide if criminal charges
 
00:27:07.389 --> 00:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
should be brought forward so there's a
 
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
system in place that works quite well um
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
and it I I don't think we need to this
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
is something we don't need to T touch in
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
my opinion thank
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
appr I know I came in a little bit late
 
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like the system failed
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
this family how do we fix that
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
I can't other than I don't want to get
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
into the details of that case um I don't
 
00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:33.799 align:start position:0%
think the
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
investigation that was done based off
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
what I've read and what my department
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
got involved in um I don't think the
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
investigation failed the family perhaps
 
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
there's some you know non-p
 
00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
police matters that could be addressed
 
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
by the town that's not for me to say um
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
these are
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunate incidents where uh motor
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle crashes I think people some
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
times automatically have a perception
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
that somebody's at fault but when you
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
investigate and reconstruct and apply
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
the applicable statutes um sometimes you
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
come to these unfortunate conclusions
 
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
that um nobody's probably ever going to
 
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799 align:start position:0%
be satisfied with follow
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
up I get that but it seemed like they
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
didn't even get any
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
information explaining all of that they
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
just got left hanging in the breeze and
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm wrong but I'm just trying to
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
wrap my head around this and that could
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
be the case representative Pro but again
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
it would be inappropriate for me to yep
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
I get it
 
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:39.519 align:start position:0%
I there that it seems to be an issue
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
sorry follow up recognized for a
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
question yes I'll get to that it seems
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
to be an
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
issue how do we fix
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
that I think
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
if again like I said my testimony no I
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
think if I'll answer you best I can I
 
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
think if a victim or a victim's family
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
is not satisfied with their performance
 
00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:05.519 align:start position:0%
of their Police Department that they can
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
go to the public Integrity unit they can
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
go to the conduct Review Committee the
 
00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
things that this body has put into place
 
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
um which I think is is valuable and is
 
00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:16.519 align:start position:0%
working well um that's where they can go
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
to air those
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
grievances I'll let it go at that thank
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
you sir representative
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
Muse thanks for taking my question yes
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
sir um to to to what extent do you think
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
um police officers in this situation or
 
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
the folks who are interacting directly
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
with victims um would make uh
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
potentially the family of a victim aware
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
of uh a route like the public Integrity
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
unit or going to a county attorney is
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
that something that uh that is well
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
known by police and is it something that
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
officers are actually instructed to tell
 
00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:55.519 align:start position:0%
people in situations like this if if
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
they have a problem with the
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
investigation yes I can only speak for
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
my agency but yes we do that um and I
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
think we have a public here in New
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's very well educated on
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
what's available to them as a secondary
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
or third resource if they're unhappy
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
with their Police Department that again
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
that this body has put into place um so
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
if somebody's not familiar with it then
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
we can certainly Point them in the right
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
direction and also a victim Advocate
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to make the Assumption um
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
was assigned to this grieving family um
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
did that you know how did that victim
 
00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:32.919 align:start position:0%
Advocate perform I'm going to assume
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
well I don't know I'm I'm not involved
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
but that's the really the role of a
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
victim Advocate to work with the family
 
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure they understand what's
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
going on with the process um and that
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
they are being kept a prize to
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative crise Point all along I
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
mean that's a that victim Advocate is a
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
critical role in these type of
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunate circumstances um if the
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
victim role is falling if the victim
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
Advocate is deficient um then you're
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
going to have the concerns that you
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
agree representative celik thank you
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
very much and thank you for taking my
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
question um while we know that most
 
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
police officers tend to have integrity
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
in our state we also know that there're
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
some who representative Cel
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
yes please do not speak of of off
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
officers Integrity or or Point blame to
 
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
officers in this committee I am not
 
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
doing that representative cig please ask
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
your question thank you um we know that
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are officers who forget
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
how they're supposed to behave and in
 
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:42.950 align:start position:0%
how they're supposed to behave and in
that

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
case there's opportunities where
 
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
missteps might take
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
place you're saying that a if I'm
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
understanding you're saying the families
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
recourses to go to a county attorney
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
who's an elected
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
official how do they know what to do if
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
the county attorney is also still not
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
providing the support that you're saying
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
that they would be directed to get what
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
what's their option to to get the
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate well I would say that to
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
your first point um there's people in
 
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
every profession that missed step um so
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
I'll take exception to that first
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
comment but the second one um if they
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
choose you know they go to their County
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
attorney um I have no reasons in this
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
case or any case in my experience to to
 
00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:26.519 align:start position:0%
doubt the Integrity of professional Lima
 
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
County attorney whether they're elected
 
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
or not um they're in that position to do
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
a job if people don't feel that they're
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
doing their job appropriately then I
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
encourage a victim or a victim's family
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
to go to the public Integrity unit to go
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
to the conduct Review Committee where
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
these things can be addressed if they
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
have an issue with law enforcement
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
that's what these things were put in
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
place for I don't this bill is not going
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
to to change that there's already
 
00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:54.519 align:start position:0%
systems in place to validate
 
00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
investigations and to raise concerns
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
about the behavior of alleged behavior
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
official chairman Roy uh thank you
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
Chief last question I have on a on a
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
citation is it is it unusual to issue a
 
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
citation on the scene before the
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
accident reconstruction because doesn't
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
that possibly lead to having to withdraw
 
00:33:23.159 --> 00:33:24.950 align:start position:0%
that possibly lead to having to withdraw
or

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
change I mean if there's a if there's a
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
a clear violation again I'll just use
 
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
generic investigations on on involving
 
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle crash um if there's a
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
clear contributing factor to the crash
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
at the scene whether it's a you know
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
your minor accidents then yes officers
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
will issue a summons at the scene for f
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
the yield stop sign valuation speed if
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
it's clear that that was the
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
contributing factor generally with my
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
agency if you're investigating a serious
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
ble injury crash or a fatal motor
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle accident we usually Reserve all
 
00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
that until the investigation is
 
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.710 align:start position:0%
that until the investigation is
completely

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
done it could follow
 
00:34:06.029 --> 00:34:06.039 align:start position:0%
up is it unusual to have a citation
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
withdrawn after its issue I I've seen
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
that done before yeah yeah thank you
 
00:34:12.599 --> 00:34:15.990 align:start position:0%
that done before yeah yeah thank you
representative

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
Newman uh you've mentioned several U
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
people that you can go to when you have
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
a problem with an investigation whether
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
whatever the problem happens to be and I
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
think it was public Integrity unit
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
County attorney vict
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
Advocate are there any others that
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
conduct Review
 
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
Committee conduct Review Committee
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's um that was established um began
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
taking in complaints in January of
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
2023 over police standards and training
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
Council uh yeah and just to follow up
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
where do they go to find out where these
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
people are I think that maybe in the
 
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:54.919 align:start position:0%
circumstances of an accident like that
 
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
and the condition did they get get that
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
from the city or the town or city the
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
town um website um there rsas on it um
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
again that this body established thank
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
Pratt Chief I have
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
a do you have policies in place or is it
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
common practice as the president of New
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police Chiefs is it common
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
practice around the state of New
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to have a procedure to call in
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
the State Police reconstruction team if
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
anybody in a town employment is involved
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
in the accident yes there's there's
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
probably a handful of U municipalities
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the state that have
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
a fully trained accident reconstruction
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
team um myself I believe Derry does um
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
your midsize larger agencies tend to um
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
they'll have one or two officers in your
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
smaller community that may be trained
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
accident reconstructionists but what you
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
will find in your smaller communities um
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
they will call in New Hampshire State
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
Police acent reconstruction team to to
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
handle it particularly a a
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%

probably 100 ft up after they they
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
headed north on the bypass and um nobody
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
was going very fast and the play blaming
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
blam blaming this on motorcycle speed uh
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%

technical capacity um there are a number

to the situation that arose that um and
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
the tragedy that befell this family and
 
00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
my heart goes out to the family um and

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
affected by by this incident
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
um the um were the legislature to pass
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
this bill in its form for our office to
 
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh be uh ready to support it it would
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
need a number of technical changes first
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
of which i' point out excuse me that the
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
solicitor general Is Not An Inspector
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
General our state does not have an
 
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
inspector General the solicitor
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
General's responsibility at the doj is
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
not criminal in nature they oversee the
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
uh all appeals to the Supreme Court it's
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
not an office it's a uh a person who is
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
really the chief legal officer that
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
advises the the Attorney General um
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
really has no oversight into criminal
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
prosecutions at all um so uh and it also
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
the bill the way it reads right now is
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
our office only plays like a pass
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
through role there's no overseeing it
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
just we collect information and then
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
pass it off onto State Police we don't
 
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
see why that couldn't if the committee
 
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
were to pursue this function why it
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't just go to uh State Police um
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
but uh also I just want to re uh
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
reiterate what Chief aldenberg said
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
there is a process in place um and
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
whether it was followed in this instance
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
I I don't know um but there is a process
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's well known to those in the law
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community um if there's an
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
officer who's alleged to have engaged in
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
misconduct during the course of an
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
investigation we had a legislation that
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
passed that went into effect last year
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
through the Lea process the governor's
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
Lea commission and um and so those
 
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
reports of misconduct it creates a
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide repository for complaints of
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
misconduct at police standards and
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
training Council and there's a
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
misconduct review new committee that
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
oversees takes a look at the
 
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
investigation looks at any sort of
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
internal investigation that might be
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
associated with that and uh makes
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the extent in the law
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
right now they are the Hub and if there
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
is a public Integrity violation that is
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
identified by police standards and
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
training they cease their investigation
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
and then refer it over to our public
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
Integrity unit at the doj who then
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
follows up if there's no complaint of
 
00:41:27.069 --> 00:41:27.079 align:start position:0%
misconduct or maybe the misconduct was
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
unfounded or or not sustained um and
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
there it's a review over the uh validity
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
of the investigation or maybe there was
 
00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
just uh maybe it wasn't thorough or
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
complete those decisions get first
 
00:41:41.309 --> 00:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
initially reviewed by the county
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
attorney's office on Prosecuting
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
decisions in the most most instances
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
these are for non-
 
00:41:51.069 --> 00:41:51.079 align:start position:0%
homicides um and uh the County Attorney
 
00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:52.839 align:start position:0%
makes a decision on whether or not to
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
prosecute a particular individual based
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
on the facts and circumstances the cases
 
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
um and and if somebody is dissatisfied a
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
victim a member of the community um the
 
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
uh the police chief is dissatisfied with
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor's decision all of those
 
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
get funneled to our office in the
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
criminal Bureau the division of public
 
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
protection which the solicitor general
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
is not in um and those get reviewed for
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
what's called an abusive discretion
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
review and um our office does take those
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
seriously we review the facts and
 
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
evidence um and and make a determination
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
of whether or not the prosecutor abused
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
their discretion in determining not to
 
00:42:34.359 --> 00:42:40.190 align:start position:0%
their discretion in determining not to
charge

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
somebody so I do think um that that
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's as I've outlined it that's
 
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
generally um the the information's in
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement memo it's
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
communicated and trained on um with
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
certainly U with prosecutors um and and
 
00:42:58.589 --> 00:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
uh it it's a process that's just well
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
known in the state could it be codified
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
in law sure it could be it's not um the
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
reason why that it um isn't uh is that
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
there's a general supervisory Authority
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
that our office executes uh uh exercises
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
over the county attorney's office so we
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
don't really see the need for that um so
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to bring those um items
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
to your attention um and just uh we as
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
written we are opposed to it but if it
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
needs further work we're happy to engage
 
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much are there
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
Muse is it problematic for you in any
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
way that uh the audio appears to have
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
been re either redacted or never
 
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
recorded uh on the tape so I can't talk
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
about the inis the actual investigation
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
itself but I would say that in general
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
if there is any sort of
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
um uh we do have because I don't know
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
whether the the footage that you're
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
talking about is it body worn camera VI
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
footage or is it some other footage um
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
but if there's any evidence or even the
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
appearance of some some sort of Foul
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
Play that would have caused that to
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
happen um then I would say that that's
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
an issue that's addressed in current law
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
under RSA 106l which would be a
 
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
complaint of misconduct against an
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
officer and we do have just a mention of
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
bodyw warn camera footage there are
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
um pretty substantial restrictions on
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
what can and can't be done with body
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
warn camera footage and how it's to be
 
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
preserved so if there were to be a
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
preservation issue that's related to
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
that then that would be of of highest
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
concern for the misconduct Review
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
Committee thank
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
celik thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
my question um I just at this opening of
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony you said the solicitor
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
general is not the something and I
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
didn't catch the words to write that
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
down yep it's not the appropriate person
 
00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
in our office that would review
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
something like this you gave a I'm sorry
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
you gave a you said the Attorney General
 
00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
is not the something you gave another
 
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
word for it I just didn't hear what that
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
word was
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
I'm oh the Inspector General thank you
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
yes um some states have inspector
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
generals that
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
um that are act as a um similar to what
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
our frankly what our misconduct Review
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
Committee does um and they will look to
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
see whether there's any sort of
 
00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:35.559 align:start position:0%
improprieties um and our state opted to
 
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
move uh that function into police
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
standards and
 
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
training representative
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
Newman sounded like since the solicitor
 
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
general wasn't the right place this may
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
not be the the correct law that should
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
be amended do you have any idea about
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
what where it should go if it does not
 
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.790 align:start position:0%
what where it should go if it does not
Bel

00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
Bel
 
00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.390 align:start position:0%
Bel
here

00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
well I think RSA
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
106l um would be a good candidate um
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
there's um the criminal that's a good
 
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
question I one I did not prepare for
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
there's um the Attorney General statute
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
is generally uh found in two places it's
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 21m and RSA 7 um there is in RSA 7 a
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
division of public protection that is
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
established um and that is the division
 
00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.670 align:start position:0%
established um and that is the division
that

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
oversees uh all criminal cases in our
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
office it's the criminal side of the
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
house as opposed to the Civil side which
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
is where the solicitor general is follow
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
up um I'm looking at what the law says
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
here and you indicated there would be
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
additional work and this could require
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things and it says on upon
 
00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:56.559 align:start position:0%
so assuming that someone you got a
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
request from one of the people in the
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
bill um says on on receipt and review
 
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
the solicit the solicitor general maybe
 
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
it's the attorney general or someone
 
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
else it should be or the design shall
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
direct the state police I always have
 
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:15.559 align:start position:0%
trouble with the word shall and the word
 
00:47:19.549 --> 00:47:19.559 align:start position:0%
May so I mean I would prefer to see may
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
but only if the review that we're
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
talking about is sufficient to where
 
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
maybe if if you got in a case similar to
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
this a request for a review that it
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
would be a robust review and you could
 
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
either maybe come up with you want it
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
should go forward to the state police or
 
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
not go forward to the state police I
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
mean could you just comment on that yeah
 
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.230 align:start position:0%
mean could you just comment on that yeah
I'm

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
there there are certainly cases that are
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
unlike other cases and so discretion is
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
always whenever there's limited
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
resources discretion is always per
 
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
referred um what what sh creates is that
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
if there is um it it creates the
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
instance that in every single case that
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
that everything needs to be fully
 
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
reviewed that certainly would be
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
problematic from a resource perspective
 
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
because the reality is there's only so
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
many people to to be able to do that
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
when we did do a fiscal note on this um
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
we indicated that if if we were to take
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
on this role it would require a
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
full-time investigator a full-time um I
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
think paralal and a prosecutor so
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
there's a you know Hefty role that would
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
need to be played in in conducting this
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
type of review that may be less if it's
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
a more discretionary
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
role thank
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
you chairman
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
Roy thank you attorney BR um if the law
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
said simply that in cases where a town
 
00:48:59.549 --> 00:48:59.559 align:start position:0%
employee or someone however the language
 
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
were that there was a a clear conflict
 
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:05.720 align:start position:0%
that the case shall
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
be conflicted out to the state police or
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
another department would that be less
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
problematic it would be it would be and
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
I I wonder if if if maybe um looping and
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
director skippa to understand what is
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
actually trained at the police standards
 
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
and training because there may be in a
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
uh training that not aware of on ethics
 
00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:29.799 align:start position:0%
and conflicts um but I'm not aware of
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
any sort of statute on conflict um with
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
respect to police investigations follow
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
up because it seems to me and I'd like
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
your opinion that this whole situation
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
could have been avoided if it was
 
00:49:47.069 --> 00:49:47.079 align:start position:0%
conflicted out from the very moment that
 
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
it was recognized that the person was a
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
former or current Town employee that
 
00:49:54.789 --> 00:49:54.799 align:start position:0%
they had just conflicted it out and
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
right away it was conducted by the state
 
00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
of police instead of looking at
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
reinvestigating everything if it was
 
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
done by Independent party in the first
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
place would that not avoid a lot of this
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
so not speaking to the specific facts of
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
this particular investigation but in my
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
experience of having represented State
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
Police for the last decade um we try to
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that conflicts are identified
 
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
before the investigation starts thank
 
00:50:22.589 --> 00:50:22.599 align:start position:0%
you representative Stone thank you madam
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
question currently is there anything
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
that prohibits uh a town like dairy or
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
Salem OR Seabrook from Contracting out
 
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
with a private entity such as like
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
Municipal resources Inc to do a uh
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
internal audit of their practices
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that would prohibit that
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
is that what you're asking sorry correct
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
yeah no and followup and are you aware
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
if those uh sometimes are utilized those
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
private entities to do uh internal
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
controls on agencies for Town yes thank
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
you see no more further questions thank
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%

time today like recounting my views on
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
the investigation I think my my mother
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
did a an outstanding job providing that
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
context that's not what I want to speak
 
00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:54.069 align:start position:0%
context that's not what I want to speak
about

00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
today I I just want to I want to take
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
some time to address the intent for
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
1566 codifying accountability is the
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
duty that we have to create a process
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
that sustains outcomes that are best for
 
00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:11.710 align:start position:0%
that sustains outcomes that are best for
the

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:14.839 align:start position:0%
public that is an important thing that
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
governing bodies need to
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
do when the process fails once it fails
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
it can fail every time until you make a
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
change so this bill in my opinion is
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
about codifying that accountability such
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
that no family has to go through and
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
endure the things that we had to endure
 
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
during what I would argue is like the
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
most tragic period in our in our life um
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
I sent a letter to
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
the well in January I finally was able
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
to get a meeting with the elected
 
00:52:52.829 --> 00:52:52.839 align:start position:0%
officials in Derry the Town
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
Administrator excuse me I'm getting over
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
cold here uh and we had a productive
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
one-hour discussion in the town offices
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
and dairy I followed that discussion
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
with a a very detailed letter which I
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
believe was made available to this
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
committee if not I'm happy to provide
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
that um that outlines the concerns that
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
we had the what we went through and the
 
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
things that you know we were looking to
 
00:53:21.069 --> 00:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
addressed no Pro no forward progress was
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
made until
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
that meeting and until representative B
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
introduced legislation like this
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
one the process is broken if it takes
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
that much initiative and effort and
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
knowhow and connections to be able to
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
get to a resolution that should just be
 
00:53:47.069 --> 00:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
codified accountability in
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
law I I want to provide that from you
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
know the context of the family who had
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
to go through this I mean you know we we
 
00:53:56.349 --> 00:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
were dealing with things things
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
that no family should have to deal with
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
and I had to put that aside to go fight
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
a system that's supposed to fight for me
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
right so I just wanted to I wanted to
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
share that perspective with you and I
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to ensure that you got that
 
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
letter because you know after we figured
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
the process out I did have a couple of
 
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
productive conversations with those
 
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
folks but that's just not common
 
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge you know that that's not what
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
families who are grieving know how to do
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
and frankly I commend my my family for
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
figuring out ways around this initially
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
and then just hitting dead ends I'm not
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
sure why I was able to clear some of
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
those but that's not what it should take
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
and so I believe this this bill will
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
codify some accountability such that
 
00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
families have an Avenue forward in these
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
situations thank
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much and again we
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.069 align:start position:0%
offer our condolences for the loss of
your

00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
sister

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:13.789 align:start position:0%
 
major

00:55:13.789 --> 00:55:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
bright good morning thank you for
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony uh for the record
 
00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
my name is uh Bill brigh I'm a major
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
with theate police I oversee um all of
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
our Investigative Services Bureau
 
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
um first of all I too will uh share my
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
condolences to the uh family in this
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
case that was mentioned today um I have
 
00:55:37.789 --> 00:55:37.799 align:start position:0%
no knowledge of uh what took place in
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
this investigation or anything to do
 
00:55:42.029 --> 00:55:42.039 align:start position:0%
with this situation my testimony is
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
based solely on the uh the bill that was
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
submitted and uh how we perceive this uh
 
00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:50.839 align:start position:0%
to affect the state police and police
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
investigations in general um so it has
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the situation that
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
was brought forward this morning because
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
I I have no knowledge of
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion there's already
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
checks and balances for uh police
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
agencies uh that have complicated
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
investigations to have their
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
investigations reviewed by other police
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
agencies and I believe that that's up to
 
00:56:16.589 --> 00:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
the administrator of that police agency
 
00:56:20.109 --> 00:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
to make a request um to an to another
 
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
agency that happens on a regular basis
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
now there's also uh reviews by prosecute
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
uh Prosecuting authorities that also
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
happens on a on a regular basis whether
 
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
that's a local prosecutor or a County
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
prosecutor most times with a complicated
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
investigation those uh that will be um
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
used as a way to determine uh charges
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
that come out of an investigation so
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
those decisions are not made solely by
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
the investigator involved but it's
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
somebody outside of uh being someone
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
outside of who is involved in that
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
investigation that's taking a look at
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
all the evidence there may be
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
suggestions made to um enhance the
 
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
investigation to continue with the
 
00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
investigation um these things happen on
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
a regular basis with our County
 
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys the state police um on a
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
regular basis are asked to assist with
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
investigations by local uh police
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
departments this
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
happens on a daily basis with multiple
 
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
units that we have um in a crash
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
investigation our our car team our crash
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
investigation team is extremely busy
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
they they do investigate these cases for
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
either in conjunction with a a police
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
agency or for a police agency depending
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
on the circumstances and the
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
capabilities of of that
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
agency in addition uh the state police
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis are asked to conduct
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
investigations when there are conflicts
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
um as was mentioned earlier um this
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
happens multiple times a month so if a
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh police agency or a county attorney or
 
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
even a governing body of of a town they
 
00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:10.119 align:start position:0%
can make a request to the state police
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
um to investigate an incident and that
 
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
could be for a multiple um could be for
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons it could be an employee
 
00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:21.039 align:start position:0%
of the town is involved it could be an
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
employee of the police agency is
 
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
involved um those are typically uh
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
off-duty that would typically be an
 
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
off-duty conduct type of uh situation on
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
duty cond conduct would go to the
 
00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to the public
 
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
Integrity unit um it could just be that
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
the official uh of that police police
 
00:58:44.829 --> 00:58:44.839 align:start position:0%
agency the police chief or or somebody
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
in that police organization who feels
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
that they know somebody that is involved
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
in an incident too well and they they
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
want to avoid the the um
 
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
impropriety of you know causing concern
 
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
so they request us to conduct
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
investigations we make those decisions
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
based on on the you know the conflicts
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
that are presented to us and we uh
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
conduct those investigations all the
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
time um and as the the chief mentioned
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh I think the way this bill is written
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
it it suggests that the state police
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
will reinvestigate an incident and I
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
think that there are some pitfalls there
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
I know when the uh sponsor of the bill
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
um brought this forward it sounded more
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
like well no this would be to ass Cy
 
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
that's what it sounded like to me I'm
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure of the intention um
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit different than a
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
reinvestigation I believe that if there
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
is if an incident has been investigated
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
and then somebody reinvestigate that
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
there are some pitfalls that can happen
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
there that could cause um a victim or a
 
00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
victim's family to not get the justice
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
that they're looking for for because of
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
some of the things that could happen in
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
in there that the chief mentioned
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
whether that's impeachment of of
 
01:00:03.069 --> 01:00:03.079 align:start position:0%
witnesses there could be additional
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
information but uh duplicate information
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes is not helpful um usually when
 
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
a uh when somebody is interviewed for an
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
incident their first statement is is the
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
most valid statement that you can get
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
and that's why we try and conduct those
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
investigations as as quickly as
 
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
possible um and then just finally I will
 
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
just say that as far as our resources go
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
with the state police um if this bill
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
were to pass like this and uh multiple
 
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
requests came in this could overwhelm uh
 
01:00:39.029 --> 01:00:39.039 align:start position:0%
our resources right now as as
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
police I'll take any questions if
 
01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:47.480 align:start position:0%
anybody has thank you thank you very
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you for taking my question um
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
about a year ago there there was a
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
similar incident in Portsmouth uh I
 
01:00:59.230 --> 01:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
believe involving an employee for the
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Police Department who was in
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
an accident uh there was a person who
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
was killed the police chief in
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth referred um a police action
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
to the state police at that point so the
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
state police handled the
 
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
investigation to your knowledge given
 
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
the similarity between the two incidents
 
01:01:22.349 --> 01:01:22.359 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't have this accident been
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
simply referred to the state police for
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
exact the same
 
01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:28.839 align:start position:0%
reason so I don't not knowing this the
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
exact circumstances and the relationship
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh that's been suggested that the police
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
department has uh with the with a person
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
involved in this investigation I mean
 
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
that could that could be determined by
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
the uh I guess the the level of
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
relationship that a police department
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
would have so if it's a police employee
 
01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty easy one to say yeah
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah we should probably
 
01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
have somebody else take a look at this
 
01:01:59.549 --> 01:01:59.559 align:start position:0%
if it's not that clear-cut a police
 
01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
agency may feel yeah we can impartially
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
investigate this and it and it won't be
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
an issue I don't know the circumstances
 
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
that happened here and and they
 
01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:09.799 align:start position:0%
certainly can I I
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
mean every police officer is expected to
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
be impartial and fair in whatever
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
investigation uh or incident they're
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
involved in um that is hammered home at
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
the police academy and I believe that to
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
be the case um I when there are conf
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
obvious conflicts those are you know
 
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances that you just don't want
 
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
to get you don't want to leave any
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
questions so you send that to somebody
 
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
else I don't know what the circumstances
 
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
were here so I can't really make a a
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
that no more questions right thank you
 
01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
very much major thank
 
01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:53.079 align:start position:0%

you

01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:16:07.790 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay we're opening the public hearing on
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1528 invite the sponsor to
 
01:16:15.629 --> 01:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman and members
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee and thank you representative
 
01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
new for taking notes
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to um introduce Bill House
 
01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 1528 um and for the record my name
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
is alisander Murray I represent
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 20 Manchester Ward
 
01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
9 um so this bill does something very
 
01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
simple um last year during the budgetary
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
process we instituted a new program and
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
set aside $1.4 million for a northern
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
border Alliance um which is a fund that
 
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
will give grants of money to Municipal
 
01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
police departments and other other
 
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
agencies um for the purpose of securing
 
01:16:58.510 --> 01:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
the northern border um when this program
 
01:17:00.189 --> 01:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
was instituted there was not any
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
publicly available data on the amount of
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
Crossings in New Hampshire um that could
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
back up the need for this program and
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
while the um original language includes
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of reporting it doesn't
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
have any specifics in there so this bill
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
um essentially just outlines um specific
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh measurements we would like the
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
alliance to C capure in terms of how
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
they're spending the money and what kind
 
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
of encounters um they are having at the
 
01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.590 align:start position:0%
of encounters um they are having at the
northern

01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
northern
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
border namely it says um in a semiannual
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
report the report will include the
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
number of persons arrested persons cited
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
and persons subjected to a field stoper
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
warning the aggregate data shall also
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
include an analysis of the percentage of
 
01:17:46.350 --> 01:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
the race and ethnicity of persons in
 
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
each of the
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
categories um so it's just adds two
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
lines to the existing statute so we um
 
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
can understand if the funds are being
 
01:17:56.189 --> 01:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
utilized and if there is a need for them
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
to be there in the first place but
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's all I
 
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
have thank you any questions represent
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
Muse is this the only data that would
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
actually be required or for example
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
would there also be data on things like
 
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
um which um you which authority uh
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
conducted the arrest or the stop where
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
the stop was located and would there be
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
a requirement to actually differentiate
 
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
in the data between a field stop a
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
citation and an arrest or would all that
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
be aggregated into one happy
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
hamburger um in this in this bill as
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
written it would all be aggregated it
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be separated into different
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
portions although from my understanding
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
after I had um drafted this bill the
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
state police has put forward their own
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
internal policy to outline um some of
 
01:18:50.629 --> 01:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
the uh data that they want to be
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
collecting as well um so this just makes
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
makes certain things mandatory by law
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
but they may also be conducting further
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
data collection um on their own based on

PR I know I walked in late and you said
 
01:19:09.629 --> 01:19:09.639 align:start position:0%
we want to collect this data who's
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
we um this is just so what in the bill
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
as passed it already um required a semi
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
semiannual report to be given to the um
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislative body um so this is just
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.669 align:start position:0%

01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
wheeler Mr chairman if I may could I
 
01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
wave off and actually take a pink
 
01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
card sure represent Stone thank you Mr
 
01:19:37.629 --> 01:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:19:39.629 --> 01:19:39.639 align:start position:0%
question I see you listed in here
 
01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
warning do we get generally give
 
01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
warnings out for illegal
 
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
Crossings I think that there are a broad
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
variety of interactions that are going
 
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
to be had by the officers while using
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
this um these funds so we just want to
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
capture any any kind of encounters that
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
might be happening and I think um part
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
of the concern from the general public
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
right now is um stops that might happen
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
with people that are not illegal
 
01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
immigrants followup that' be in regards
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
to say like the authorities working
 
01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
under the state or the political
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
subdivision of the
 
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
state I'm sorry what uh State Police um
 
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
I mean the funds I think are going from
 
01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
the state police essentially to the
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
municipal departments when it's not from
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
the state police that those actions are
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
happening so that' be the political
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
subdivisions yeah yeah thank
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
you represent Pratt hello I have a
 
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
couple questions here one one question
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
may actually uh the bill States person
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
cited person subjected persons of each
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
category now that doesn't mean their
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
name does
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
it no I think we're just looking for a
 
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
chaffy good morning chairman Roy and
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
other honorable members of the committee
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
my name is Devon chaffy and I'm the
 
01:21:17.709 --> 01:21:17.719 align:start position:0%
executive director of the ACLU of New
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh it's been quite a while
 
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
since I've had the pleasure of
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
testifying before this committee and I
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
am very honored to have the opportunity
 
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
to do so today um and I am here to
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of HB 1528 to expand
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirements tied to the
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
Border policing program uh that was
 
01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
included in the most recent budget and I
 
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
want to start by just reminding the me
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh members of the committee how we got
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
here where we are today um many of you
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
may remember that just last year the New
 
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house voted overwhelmingly to
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
strip the northern border policing money
 
01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
from hb2 the budget Bill and that was a
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
vote of 241 to 143 so there was very
 
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
strong bipartisan opposition in the
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
house to this program now this funding
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
was eventually added back into the
 
01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
budget as part of the committee of
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
conference compromise but at that time
 
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
we had no data about any issues with
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
northern border Encounters in the state
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire all we had were
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
statements from the governor and the
 
01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
State citing and the department of
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
safety sorry citing numbers from a broad
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
swath of Northern of the northern border
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
called the Swanton sector now the
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
Swanton sector includes not just New
 
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but large portions of Vermont
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
and New
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
York but we had didn't have any data
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
that was specific to New Hampshire the
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
state where the taxpayers would be
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
paying for this program and of course
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
where the money would be spent so we
 
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
asked the department of safety and other
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
new hampsh agencies for the New
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific data and they said
 
01:22:58.990 --> 01:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
that they didn't have any so we asked
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
border patrol for this data and they
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
refused to give New Hampshire specific
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
data on their
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
encounters and quite frankly this was
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
baffling to us that these agencies would
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
be asking for over a million dollar to
 
01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
address the supposed problem and yet
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
there was no New Hampshire specific data
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
available so the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
sued for this information
 
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
and just 2 weeks ago several months
 
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
after the budget had already been passed
 
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
we finally received this information as
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
part of a settlement in a Freedom of
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
Information lawsuit against border
 
01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
patrol and I have to say what we found
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
was pretty striking in 15 months border
 
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
patrol recorded only 21 apprehensions
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
and encounters and of those 21
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
encounters 14 were from two incidences
 
01:23:57.790 --> 01:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
so we are talking about fewer than 10
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
incidents that border patrol is
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
addressing in more than a
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
year further out of the 367 so-called
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
swaton sector apprehensions that New
 
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire officials were citing last
 
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
year to justify this spending on the New
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh policing border policing
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
program only one of all of those
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
apprehensions was actually in the state
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that's
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
0.27% of the Swanton sector encounters
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
were happening in this state so in fact
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
the data that we have finally obtained
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
shows no evidence that there's any
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
significant increase or any real problem
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
at all in author in unauthorized border
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
crossings in New
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this quite frankly makes
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
common sense for anybody who is familiar
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire northern border
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
and how extremely rugged the terrain is
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
now in response to this recent data the
 
01:24:57.109 --> 01:24:57.119 align:start position:0%
governor has tried to claim that the
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
data was quote unquote cherry-picked and
 
01:25:01.149 --> 01:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
that it only included apprehensions and
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
not encounters but I have an email here
 
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
today that state from border patrol
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
stating that the data does include both
 
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
apprehensions and encounters and I'm
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
happy to share that the governor has
 
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
also made what I find to be a confusing
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
claim that if we only spent more money
 
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
on border security we would somehow find
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
more unauthorized people trying to cross
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire border this despite
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that state police were unable
 
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
to spend 30% of operation stone garden
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
funds that it received from the federal
 
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
government in 2022 to secure the Border
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
quite frankly this sounds like the
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
classic case of a solution in search of
 
01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:42.669 align:start position:0%
classic case of a solution in search of
a

01:25:42.669 --> 01:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
problem the bottom line here is this it
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
was not right that the public and the
 
01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
legislature you all did not have access
 
01:25:53.709 --> 01:25:53.719 align:start position:0%
to the Bas basic New Hampshire specific
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
data when budget decisions about this
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
border policing program were made last
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
year and New Hampshire legislators and
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have a right to know how this
 
01:26:05.229 --> 01:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
money is being spent and whether the
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
expense is ultimately Justified and for
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
these reasons I respectfully urge you to
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
support hb1 1528 thank you so much for
 
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.310 align:start position:0%
support hb1 1528 thank you so much for

time thank you I don't see any questions
 
01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
thanks

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you chairman Roy members
 
01:26:39.629 --> 01:26:39.639 align:start position:0%
of the committee I found myself about to
 
01:26:41.709 --> 01:26:41.719 align:start position:0%
ask a would you believe question figured
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
it might be better to just come to the
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
dis um I believe that if there is an
 
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
issue on the northern border that it's
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
worthwhile for us to get the data about
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
out that issue so that we can spend the
 
01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate amounts of money on it and
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
if the legislature which as we've
 
01:27:02.189 --> 01:27:02.199 align:start position:0%
decided in our budget wants to spend
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
money on that issue I think it would be
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate to know how much money we
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
should spend in an appropriate way so I
 
01:27:10.109 --> 01:27:10.119 align:start position:0%
think having the data on that issue is a
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
good thing and Senator Shaheen last week
 
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
I believe was in committee I forget
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
which one there's so many subcommittees
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
in the Senate that you it's hard to keep
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
track but she asked uh secretary mayaras
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
about uh the data for New Hampshire
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
specific data for The Crossings of the
 
01:27:31.229 --> 01:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
border and uh unfortunately secretary
 
01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:33.639 align:start position:0%
mayorcas uh did not answer the question
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
and was uh kind of Sid stepping her a
 
01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
little bit and she had mentioned the
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
fact that her office had tried to to get
 
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
that data from the the doj but was
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
unable to and secretary mayorcas did
 
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
make a commitment to get her that data
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we see that from the
 
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
Senator's office at some point but
 
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it seems that the only way
 
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
that we'd be able to get this data is by
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
moving forward with HB
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
1528 uh to have New Hampshire specific
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
data if the doj is not going to move
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
forward with it and um you know whether
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
you're on the left on this issue or on
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
the right on this issue I think having
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
data about who is crossing our border is
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
is probably a good thing and it'd be a
 
01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.870 align:start position:0%
is probably a good thing and it'd be a
worthwhile

01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
worthwhile
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh process to move forward with
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
especially if we have decided as we have
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
in the budget to spend money on on on uh
 
01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
border of protection so with that Mr
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
chairman uh would you believe and have
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.229 --> 01:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
Wellington good morning uh Mr chair and
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I'm
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
Christine Wellington I'm a resident of
 
01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
dairy um and I'm also a member of the
 
01:28:58.270 --> 01:28:58.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire immigrants rights Network
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
I I wanted to point out that uh last
 
01:29:02.109 --> 01:29:02.119 align:start position:0%
evening I sent a letter on behalf of the
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
network to members of this committee um
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
most of the um points I would would have
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to make have been made I just
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to um also point out and and
 
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
emphasize a little bit that beyond the
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
um whether this uh northern border
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
Alliance program is necessary it is in
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
fact um ongoing now and people will be
 
01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
out on patrol if they're not already on
 
01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
patrol one of our concerns is um whether
 
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
they'd be um incidents of racial or
 
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
ethnic profiling which makes um
 
01:29:35.709 --> 01:29:35.719 align:start position:0%
collecting data uh really important not
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
only important to the people of New
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but for the New Hampshire
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
State Police themselves who are
 
01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
overseeing all of uh this program
 
01:29:45.149 --> 01:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
whether U the the uh patrols are
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
conducted by local Fisher game or any
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
other department including the state
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
police themselves so I think that's all
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
I wanted to add to this this um
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
discussion and and ask that you um uh
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%

bill

01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair in the committee my
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
name is uh representative Kelly Penza
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
straford District
 
01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
19 um so I'd like to give a story about
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
why this bill came to um came to
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
fruition I received a call from a mother
 
01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
a grieving mother uh in
 
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
Rochester and and no one has helped her
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh she's called every entity you can
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
imagine in the state from federal all
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
the way down to uh local and Governor
 
01:31:33.149 --> 01:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
executive Council uh senators and then
 
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
um other reps even in uh my district and
 
01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
uh I answered the phone and said that I
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
would help
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
her her daughter has been in and out of
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital multiple times
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
and so the reason why I've put this bill
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
in is because systems don't speak to
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
each other and I am not an expert on you
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
know criminal justice and systems or
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
anything like that but this bill is is
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
is basically
 
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
helping not only law
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement um but our but the folks
 
01:32:17.550 --> 01:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
that are in the jails um as well as just
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
helping you know the individuals that
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
need um Mental Health
 
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
so for example her her daughter has been
 
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
in and out of New Hampshire hospital I
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
can't she's texting me right now I can't
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
tell you how many times and she's she
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be released that's the problem
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
she has schizophrenia she gets released
 
01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
she doesn't take her meds she gets
 
01:32:43.149 --> 01:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
arrested it's a vicious cycle she's
 
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
incarcerated right now in bnap
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
County so involuntary emergency
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
admissions is part of the judicial
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
branch right and you know just because
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
of some personal stuff I've realized how
 
01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
and you kind of have to learn you know
 
01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:01.119 align:start position:0%
on the criminal side that doesn't speak
 
01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
to the judicial side they're really two
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
separate entities so but if someone has
 
01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.350 align:start position:0%
separate entities so but if someone has
an

01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
iea an active one and and the police
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
have no idea of that um then they're
 
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with in which they already are
 
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
as we know because of you know the lack
 
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
of mental um Health in our in our state
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
um they're having to deal with a
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
situation um with someone they don't
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
have any backstory they don't have the
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
Ia on file because the systems don't
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
speak to each other um and then they're
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
taking care of it um in their jails uh I
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
have spoken to multiple people
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state uh uh prosecutors
 
01:33:46.629 --> 01:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh I have spoken to um you know the
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
folks in Rochester they've been
 
01:33:51.870 --> 01:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
fantastic um you know I I don't know if
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
there's going to be opposition to this
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
or not uh I assume that you know I
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
really didn't look at the financial note
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
this is really just something where I'm
 
01:34:01.709 --> 01:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
not looking for a new database to be
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
spent I know how the bill was written um
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's really where it's like a connector
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
where someone could you know uh you know
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
a police officer um someone of course in
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
the jail could you know type that in and
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
see if there's active like an iea on
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
file and to be able to see a history so
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
for this young woman who has suffered
 
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
from schizophrenia for over 9 years and
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
has been in and out of New Hampshire
 
01:34:32.109 --> 01:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
hospital she gets out she's good again
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
no one's really monitoring her she
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't stay on her medication she
 
01:34:37.709 --> 01:34:37.719 align:start position:0%
self-medicates there's drug
 
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
abuse it it's a it's a vicious cycle and
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
I just think that this could really help
 
01:34:43.199 --> 01:34:45.350 align:start position:0%
I just think that this could really help
and

01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
um and this is you know this is my you
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
know this was my place to do it so
 
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why this bill came
 
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
forward the second in command um at at
 
01:34:59.709 --> 01:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
in belnap County um in their in their
 
01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:03.639 align:start position:0%
jail um he was fantastic he's spoken to
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
me multiple times he agrees like I would
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
call and ask how they were you know
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
helping her when she was incarcerated
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
before New Hampshire hospital could take
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
her back in um and she was released
 
01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
after only about two weeks this last
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
time and she's arrested again uh from
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
but you know I just you know so much of
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
what he could tell me but you know
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
making sure that she was eating and all
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
of that kind of stuff because when she
 
01:35:33.629 --> 01:35:33.639 align:start position:0%
goes back in of course into um into the
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
jail she's she goes through a detox and
 
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
all of that but she's also you know they
 
01:35:41.709 --> 01:35:41.719 align:start position:0%
can do somewhat of getting her back on
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
her um her her medication to treat her
 
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia but it's it's not a
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
perfect environment of course they're
 
01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:50.679 align:start position:0%
not experts in that but they're doing
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
the best that we can and I do have to
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
commend uh our our our jails in New
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um our our law enforcement
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
officers that are in there that are
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
doing the best that they can in this
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
situation because they are dealing with
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
such a high level of um of mental
 
01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
illness um because we don't have spaces
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of room they have to
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
you have to wait uh in New Hampshire
 
01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
hospital and so I'm just this is this
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
bill is made to be able to for systems
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to talk to each other so we
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
can help people um help Law Enforcement
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
Officers so they have those connections
 
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
and more
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
information that's it and nothing some
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
bolts thank you representative is it
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
your goal with this bill so that a law
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in the field would
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
be able to when they ran someone to know
 
01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
that who they're dealing with that this
 
01:36:45.310 --> 01:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
person had a mental health issue or
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
history or active situation is that what
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do with this bill
 
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
correct so there's a Facebook post I'll
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
send it to the entire committee and uh
 
01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:58.360 align:start position:0%
this is this is how she was arrested
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
this last time and
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
um and it's just really sad it's in a
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's in a Laconia Facebook post and um
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
and she was you know obviously under the
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
influence of something and um with her
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
bags and just trying to get into cars
 
01:37:19.870 --> 01:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
and someone had you know posted that and
 
01:37:23.229 --> 01:37:23.239 align:start position:0%
reported it and but they recognized her
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
but that's because she's been in and out
 
01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
and so someone typed in there well she's
 
01:37:31.149 --> 01:37:31.159 align:start position:0%
got schizophrenia and da d d da and so
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
but it's taken a long time for law
 
01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement to know who she is but
 
01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why the last time she
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
was arrested um and and she was at the
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
jail for a long time before the New
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital took her in I mean
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
she was found uh they thought she was
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
dead lying in the middle of the road in
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
lonia so um yeah it's it's really we
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
have situations like this all over the
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
state happening and I think that this
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
level of connectivity I understand that
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
judicial is very separate from Criminal
 
01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
but there's got to be a connection where
 
01:38:07.149 --> 01:38:07.159 align:start position:0%
more information can help everyone in
 
01:38:07.159 --> 01:38:10.950 align:start position:0%
more information can help everyone in
this

01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
situation represent
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
representative Pensa for taking my
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
question um I'm curious especially
 
01:38:20.669 --> 01:38:20.679 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at the the fiscal
 
01:38:23.070 --> 01:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
note and kind of the way that it is
 
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
portrayed it seems like it would be a
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
separate database but the way that
 
01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
you're describing it it's kind of we
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
just need to have a the option to be
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
able to almost like a checkbox like this
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
this is something that or not a
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
checkbook you want be more specific but
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
something that would would be an option
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
in an existing database not a new
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
database for this specifically can you
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
just kind of clarify yes so OS pull you
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
know Drew this up so and there
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't that's how I that's how I asked
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
them to write it but they it was kind of
 
01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:55.639 align:start position:0%
um it was hard for them because it is
 
01:38:58.270 --> 01:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
two separate right now right so I I
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned words like connector and
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
things like that I mean for of course
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
people that are in this space they can
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
do these things in their sleep so if
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
there needed to be and of course with OS
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
they wanted it to be um um they wanted
 
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
to to make sure that it was um that it
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
was specific enough that it was
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
addressing it but they they didn't have
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
that language to put in there so if
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's something that would need an
 
01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:26.679 align:start position:0%
amendment or something like that was
 
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
great but it was more of a technical
 
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
aspect and that they weren't able to
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
kind of speak to so I took this like it
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
is and I also as you know as we all know
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
when we were putting in bills this was
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
one that I got at the 11th Hour there
 
01:39:43.229 --> 01:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
was no you know there was no way to get
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
um it was the day before so there was no
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
way to put changes in and so that's kind
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
of the reason why it's at but yes I
 
01:39:53.229 --> 01:39:53.239 align:start position:0%
don't I don't want some expensive system
 
01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
I want a connector great thank
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you um repres U just Mr
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
Greenland if you would um research for
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
us if you could what other states if any
 
01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
other states have this information
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
available law enforcement and also if
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
you could make note we passed a bill
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
last year in this committee that um made
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
a notification for senior citizens that
 
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
see if there's a way to language
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
connector there repr Muse wait Mr
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
chairman if if I may the the the bill
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
that I think you're speaking of I think
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
it was if the senior citizen had a a
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
medical condition yeah to be more
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
specific to make Brad's life easier
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
M so if if we pass your bill um and and
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh and and if we get an appropriation um
 
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
it it sounds like one of the things that
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
a police officer would know when they
 
01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
look up a person is whether or not they
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
have the type of mental health history
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
that you're specifying in the bill one
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
thing that we don't know is whether or
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
not that police officer has actually
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
been trained uh in how to deal with
 
01:41:05.629 --> 01:41:05.639 align:start position:0%
people who have serious mental health
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
situations do you see that as being an
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
important part of this
 
01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
too in a perfect world that would be
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
fantastic but the piece that I'm just
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
trying to um to focus on is in this
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
specific situation when you on the
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
judicial side when you do that um IA
 
01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
which is the involuntary emergency
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
admissions if that is something that is
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
filed and um in and and so for example
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
someone's on the street and they're
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
found that is so important because it
 
01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
means that you know of course she's not
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
going to necessarily just be able to go
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire hospital or hamstad or
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
something like that based upon space but
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
the the officers know the jail knows
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
during that period of time in
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
incarceration that that is that that
 
01:41:58.350 --> 01:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
person should be admitted they have
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
mental illness um but yes what I would
 
01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:03.639 align:start position:0%
love everyone to be trained with that
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
but I'm just trying to basically um have
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
the lines of communication that are open
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
for this because that's really important
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
for someone to know it took this woman
 
01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
going in and out of the system and and
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
being recognized at this point to the
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
point of on Faceook book where oh yeah
 
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
well um you know she's yes she's
 
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
self-medicating but she's got
 
01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia and and that's where she's
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
she of course she sees she talks to
 
01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
herself there's voices um it's when
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
she's on her
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
medication and uh and she detoxes from
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
the other you know drugs that she
 
01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be taking um I think she could
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
be a wonderful productive member of
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
society but she needs real treatment she
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
needs to not be let out two weeks you
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
know two to 3 weeks at a time time from
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
hospital did did you uh and someone from
 
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
the state police will be testifying
 
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
after but it was my understanding that
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
if a emergency order was issued like
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
that and the person wasn't there that
 
01:43:08.589 --> 01:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
there was a in effect a warrant issued
 
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
um did you check on that to see that if
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's already the case and if so would
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
that alleviate your concern with that so
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
if it's active yes but but when you're
 
01:43:23.950 --> 01:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
in and out it might not be active at
 
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
that point it might have been there
 
01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
might have been an active iea but it's
 
01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
not after that that point they're not
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
getting any history so they might just
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
see yeah so it's it's missing the
 
01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:35.030 align:start position:0%
see yeah so it's it's missing the
history

01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
piece um represent
 
01:43:40.109 --> 01:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
Murray um thank you Mr chair I kind of
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
have two questions one I just wanted to
 
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
um ensure you're talking about like if
 
01:43:47.589 --> 01:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
someone has been hospitalized and
 
01:43:48.910 --> 01:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be hospitalized and
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
they're found out the person who F who
 
01:43:52.990 --> 01:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
found them being able to know that they
 
01:43:54.510 --> 01:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
were supposed to be in a hospital not
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
just like documenting X person has X
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
mental condition therefore like arrest
 
01:44:03.589 --> 01:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
them upon you know finding them no
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
that's not what I'm looking at just
 
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:07.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to double check thank you um and
 
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
follow um I guess this is kind of to the
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
chair but also to see if you would be
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
open to this is there a way to tie this
 
01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
into the system that we made regarding
 
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
baale release
 
01:44:20.189 --> 01:44:20.199 align:start position:0%
and like you know it feels similar to me
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's like a about someone who should
 
01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
be I think we should leave bail alone
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.830 --> 01:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
scitech representative your agency and
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
your interest in this are loable and
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
much of what's been talked about with
 
01:44:42.669 --> 01:44:42.679 align:start position:0%
this case is all semi-public knowledge
 
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
but you mentioned it that the second in
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
command you were talking to him about
 
01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
so not I didn't get any information that
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
he can't give you know
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
to um the only reason why I I was
 
01:45:05.950 --> 01:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
following up as a I don't know if you
 
01:45:07.589 --> 01:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
know what you want to call it um
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
representing the mom because the mom
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
can't have
 
01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
guardianship um at this point um you
 
01:45:18.669 --> 01:45:18.679 align:start position:0%
know cuz her daughter is you know at an
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
age where she would have to accept that
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
so there's a piece there so I was just
 
01:45:26.589 --> 01:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
calling as a a well check and um any of
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
the other information that's been filled
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
in some of that could be from her mother
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
but everything that he gave me was
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
totally by the book that she's safe
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
she's wellfed and she's you know and
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
that she's on a weit list all of that to
 
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
go back into New Hampshire hospital um
 
01:45:44.189 --> 01:45:44.199 align:start position:0%
but I just you know I think it was um it
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
made me feel very very good about the
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
level of work um that they are doing
 
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
inside um our jails um for people that
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
suffer from mental illness while they're
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
in a holding pattern representative
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:46:02.430 --> 01:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh you just
 
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that she does not have uh
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
guardianship over this individual are
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
there any interests of privacy concerns
 
01:46:11.470 --> 01:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to a situation where
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
there's a concerned family member but
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have Guardian ship of that
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
individual versus their rights to have
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
their freedom of information as far as
 
01:46:21.070 --> 01:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
their medical stuff in their mental
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
health I think it's we're kind of
 
01:46:24.910 --> 01:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
looking at a fine line here yeah so
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
there's she can't get that she doesn't
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
get hardly anything from you know when
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
she's been in the hospital they they
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
can't give her much information meaning
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
the mother um she would really love the
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
state to be um to have that role uh I
 
01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
think that's where she's talking with
 
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
the mother is now talking with the
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
prosecutor um for this new piece to see
 
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
if that can happen and hopefully that
 
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
will happen because to have the state
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
guardianship that that would make a lot
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
of difference then there would be a
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
voice there for her daughter that's not
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
being heard so
 
01:47:01.629 --> 01:47:01.639 align:start position:0%
followup in addition in a practical
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
sense I'm not sure how you would create
 
01:47:06.189 --> 01:47:06.199 align:start position:0%
a database that would flag someone for
 
01:47:08.350 --> 01:47:08.360 align:start position:0%
an IA without in you know having the
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
indication that uh they have a mental
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
health problem I think how do you do
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
that how do you have them for the Ia and
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
then say Well they're not being you know
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
health okay I don't I don't not sure I I
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
understand your question okay no
 
01:47:30.669 --> 01:47:30.679 align:start position:0%
disregard representative um s s thank
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
you so much and thank you for taking my
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
question um I think just to to clarify
 
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
you're not suggesting that there be a
 
01:47:39.629 --> 01:47:39.639 align:start position:0%
hip of violation in disclosing the
 
01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
nature of why someone has been no um
 
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
remanded just simply a notification that
 
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
someone has one of these orders so the
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
police can be aware there was an order
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
is that correct correct so
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
um so her mom calls right and realizes
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
that she's been arrested again um this
 
01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
is not this time this is the last time
 
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
when she was found lying in the road and
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
she can barely speak and she wants to
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
know if her you know if daughter's dead
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
or alive and and you know if she's
 
01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
suffering because she's going through a
 
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
detox and is not on her meds and all
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
those types of things and um and I think
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
this just can help care for people that
 
01:48:27.589 --> 01:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
are in that situation that's really all
 
01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
it it's not sharing of people's medical
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
information or any of that kind of stuff
 
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
if this is not someone that is um
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily this Hardline criminal this
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
is someone that suffers from mental
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
illness there's a pattern there's been
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
ieas I I think having that information
 
01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement having that information
 
01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
is very important and how to help best
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
treat that person so they're
 
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
um they're just not locked in a cell do
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.589 --> 01:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
testimony it's good good the chair
 
01:49:07.199 --> 01:49:08.750 align:start position:0%
testimony it's good good the chair
recognizes

01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
recognizes
 
01:49:11.310 --> 01:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
um Cynthia
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:21.629 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:49:21.629 --> 01:49:21.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my name is Cynthia babonis
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'm a licensed clinical social worker
 
01:49:27.070 --> 01:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
and I represent New Hampshire hospital
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position on this bill
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just here to provide
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
information um and and when we reviewed
 
01:49:36.589 --> 01:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
it didn't know the background on it this
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
is we just saw it a couple days ago um
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
now that I've I've heard um the previous
 
01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
testimony understand the intent is to
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
report um all commitments including
 
01:49:50.589 --> 01:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency admission I
 
01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
initially thought that it was just the
 
01:49:53.790 --> 01:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
probate commitment which is a different
 
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
thing um that said um the information
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
that I would like to provide is that um
 
01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
if the intent is to provide law
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement with an awareness of when a
 
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
person is under a revocation of a
 
01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
conditional discharge um the wording in
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
this bill would not really meet that
 
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
need um it it would need to say that we
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
that a proposed revocation would be the
 
01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
notice because that's when the person is
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
still out in the Community pending a
 
01:50:23.229 --> 01:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
revocation and at that point the
 
01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center is aware
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
that they might need to come back to New
 
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital but New Hampshire
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
hospital isn't in that part of the
 
01:50:30.159 --> 01:50:33.430 align:start position:0%
hospital isn't in that part of the
process

01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
um providing the probate order or just
 
01:50:39.149 --> 01:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
the IIA order does include information
 
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
about someone's imminent dangerousness
 
01:50:45.149 --> 01:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
so the actual court orders do report out
 
01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
um what the the entire clinical profile
 
01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
that is the jus ification for why
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
someone's dangerous to themselves or
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
other others including their um
 
01:50:57.069 --> 01:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
diagnosis so I just want to make sure
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
people are aware that that is part of
 
01:50:58.679 --> 01:50:59.589 align:start position:0%
people are aware that that is part of
the

01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
order um and the other thing to just
 
01:51:05.669 --> 01:51:05.679 align:start position:0%
take into consideration um is that if
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
law enforcement assumes the mental
 
01:51:11.229 --> 01:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
status documented in the orders um are
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
the current mental status that includes
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
um nonemergency in voluntary commitments
 
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
then it it might create a situation
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
where they're overestimating someone's
 
01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
current dangerousness um orders
 
01:51:24.189 --> 01:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
especially for commitment can be for up
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
to 5 years when an individual is out on
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
conditional discharge and they're taking
 
01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
their medications and they're stable
 
01:51:33.950 --> 01:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
they may not present a danger at all and
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
so you you could be putting law
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement in a position of approaching
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
an individual they don't know and only
 
01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
having that order which reads about
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
their dangerousness at the time the
 
01:51:46.589 --> 01:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
order was
 
01:51:48.589 --> 01:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
written thank
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
you that could go go both ways too they
 
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
could also underestimate someone by
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
thinking that they're all set when they
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
actually have been off their meds and
 
01:52:00.189 --> 01:52:00.199 align:start position:0%
potentially I'm going to uh I'm going to
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
I I think that we all have established
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
that this needs some work but I I I like
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
the the concept so I'm going to point a
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would you be available to
 
01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
help with the subcommittee provide
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
information on potential changes to the
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
language sure thank you
 
01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:20.910 align:start position:0%
language sure thank you
questions

01:52:20.910 --> 01:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
information um name Miss babonis Could
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
you um could you provide your email a
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
contact please to um just on a if you
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
could write it down and give it to one
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
of the members on the end so we have it
 
01:52:48.589 --> 01:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh the chair
 
01:52:57.310 --> 01:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:59.550 --> 01:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg good morning chairman Roy
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
Representatives members of the committee
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
I'm Karen Rosenberg I'm the policy
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
director at the disability rights Center
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire the state's protection
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
and advocacy system for people with
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities I'm here to testify in
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
1658 while it is I understand the
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
intentions are really kind and while
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
meaning um this bill is not going to
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
provide treatment or increase
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
availability of treatment for people who
 
01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
experience mental illness it's not going
 
01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
to provide training um for law
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement to be able to successfully
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
interact with people who may be in a
 
01:53:42.189 --> 01:53:42.199 align:start position:0%
crisis nor would it provide training for
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement for the whole range of
 
01:53:45.550 --> 01:53:45.560 align:start position:0%
issues that they might encounter where
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
someone would not exhibit ex
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
unanticipated Behavior or unexpected
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
Behavior like you know failure to abide
 
01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
by a police officer's directive because
 
01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
they're deaf or because they have autism
 
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
or they're just you know for some other
 
01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
reason aren't able to do this what it
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
does do is it compromises and really
 
01:54:09.149 --> 01:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
threatens someone's rights to have
 
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
mental health information be held
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
strictly confidential current law makes
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
these proceedings generally closed
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
unless the person agrees to have in
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
involuntary commitment proceeding and
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
open proceeding they are closed and
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
those files are closed this is highly
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
sensitive information and it's the
 
01:54:32.189 --> 01:54:32.199 align:start position:0%
person who experiences mental illness
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
who has this condition who has the
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
authority to determine whether their
 
01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
personal information should be shared
 
01:54:43.069 --> 01:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
with the police or anyone frankly um so
 
01:54:46.069 --> 01:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
that the hospital should not be updating
 
01:54:47.790 --> 01:54:47.800 align:start position:0%
a database with information about
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
someone's protected health information
 
01:54:51.870 --> 01:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
it would violate federal law without
 
01:54:54.669 --> 01:54:54.679 align:start position:0%
that person's permission to do that this
 
01:54:56.910 --> 01:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't prohibit no one's prohibited
 
01:54:59.709 --> 01:54:59.719 align:start position:0%
from sharing information voluntarily if
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
they feel it would be useful for law
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement to have and also maybe along
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
with the fact that they are experiencing
 
01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:08.229 align:start position:0%
with the fact that they are experiencing
some

01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
difficulties they could provide even
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
more helpful information voluntarily
 
01:55:14.910 --> 01:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
such as what are triggers what's the
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
best way to approach me when I'm in a
 
01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
mental health situation um but I I see
 
01:55:24.069 --> 01:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
this bill as hugely problematic and as
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
um as M belon has um lets you know these
 
01:55:29.629 --> 01:55:29.639 align:start position:0%
commitment orders have extremely
 
01:55:32.430 --> 01:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
sensitive information and someone can be
 
01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
living completely successfully in the
 
01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
community and just not need the fact
 
01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
that they had a crisis known generally
 
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
in their communities by law enforcement
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
or anyone it's their information to
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
protect so um for all of those reasons
 
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
we think that this is really
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
um just it may be motivated for reasons
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
you know for someone who really
 
01:55:58.069 --> 01:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
desperately needs help but this is not
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
the solution and it would potentially
 
01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
violate a lot of people's rights I'm
 
01:56:03.870 --> 01:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um knowing how our
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
hands are are tied quite a bit by
 
01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
existing law and federal law and and
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
just the general concept of we respect
 
01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:16.669 align:start position:0%
just the general concept of we respect
people's

01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
people's
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
privacy would it be or would your
 
01:56:22.069 --> 01:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
organization be opposed to a system
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
where someone could provide a voluntary
 
01:56:27.629 --> 01:56:27.639 align:start position:0%
information where for in the case of the
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
person the representative talked about
 
01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
who's in and out of these type of
 
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
situations with law enforcement and in a
 
01:56:35.229 --> 01:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
lucid moment they said you know I really
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
would like them to know yeah I I don't
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
we would not oppose that I think there
 
01:56:42.069 --> 01:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
had been efforts in the past to
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
establish some kind of voluntary
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
Reporting System I'm not sure what
 
01:56:47.310 --> 01:56:47.320 align:start position:0%
happened to those but that would that
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
would put the control in the person
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
person who holds the right to have their
 
01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
information confidential that it's their
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
decision to make and like I said they
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
could provide some information that
 
01:56:59.950 --> 01:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
could be even more helpful than just you
 
01:57:01.069 --> 01:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
know a statement that they've been
 
01:57:03.870 --> 01:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed and would you be
 
01:57:06.069 --> 01:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
willing to work with the subcommittee um
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
to help do that sure I'd love to thank
 
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
you very much questions representative
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
Muse yes do you believe that providing
 
01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
uh this information or making this
 
01:57:20.069 --> 01:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
information available to police officers
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
who may not have been properly trained
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
in how to handle people in Mental Health
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
crisis is an issue oh yeah that's a
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
that's a huge issue because without the
 
01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679 align:start position:0%
information and training about how to
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
work with people who experience a wide
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
variety of disabilities having that
 
01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
information is right it it it's not
 
01:57:41.709 --> 01:57:41.719 align:start position:0%
helpful it could be harmful people might
 
01:57:45.229 --> 01:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
assume knowledge that they don't have um
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
so yeah it would be most helpful to have
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
this paired with some training I I know
 
01:57:51.390 --> 01:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
that Nami New Hampshire has provided
 
01:57:55.550 --> 01:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
training in the past to State Police and
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
um I think it's been successful but yeah
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
it you need to have
 
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
followup and this is a state that's very
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
careful about how it spends its money um
 
01:58:13.629 --> 01:58:13.639 align:start position:0%
do you feel the state's money would be
 
01:58:16.109 --> 01:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
better spent in creating uh a system
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
like this uh that may present the issues
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
that you've
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
outlined uh or helping more police
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
departments uh provide training to their
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
officers so they better understand how
 
01:58:31.069 --> 01:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
to help people in this
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
situation I I would like an option three
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
respectfully which would be that we
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
would invest more dollars into
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
community-based um Crisis Prevention
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
Services and housing with supports for
 
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
people who experience
 
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
significant mental health issues isues
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
because really you could have the best
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
trained person working with them but
 
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's not treatment and people really
 
01:58:58.030 --> 01:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
need treatment and supports to be
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
successful in their
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
communities if I had to pick from one or
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
two representative M I'd pick number two
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.109 --> 01:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
Murphy see you no further questions
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:59:18.239 --> 01:59:23.709 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
thanks

01:59:23.709 --> 01:59:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:32.189 --> 01:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
troter thank you Mr chair and members of
 
01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice committee my name
 
01:59:40.910 --> 01:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
is Douglas tradia I'm a representative
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
out of belnap District 8 representing
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
the towns of Belmont sington and tilted
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
this was the last minute um
 
01:59:53.069 --> 01:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
uh request to be heard on this bill um
 
01:59:55.950 --> 01:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
just so you know last year this house um
 
01:59:59.310 --> 01:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
put it into the budget for a contact
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
notification program for um people with
 
02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities physical or mental or like
 
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
autism and State Police is currently
 
02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
working on that and that bill enables a
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
person that has a disability to
 
02:00:18.430 --> 02:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
voluntarily submit their information to
 
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
their local arm enforcement um agency
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
that will be able to put it in the New
 
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police um Sports
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
terminal um this way if somebody has
 
02:00:30.189 --> 02:00:30.199 align:start position:0%
contact with an
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
individual they can um be notified by
 
02:00:36.669 --> 02:00:36.679 align:start position:0%
their Dispatch Center of that so that's
 
02:00:38.589 --> 02:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
all I want to bring up I'm just listen
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
to a little bit of testimony I think
 
02:00:42.189 --> 02:00:42.199 align:start position:0%
that might be a good area to start and
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
maybe we can add to
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
that thank you we appreciate that thank
 
02:00:48.119 --> 02:00:51.270 align:start position:0%
that thank you we appreciate that thank
you

02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:53.550 --> 02:00:53.560 align:start position:0%
we're actually looking it up right
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
now uh the the chair calls
 
02:01:01.709 --> 02:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.719 --> 02:01:08.189 align:start position:0%
 
muzy

02:01:08.189 --> 02:01:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:10.030 --> 02:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
Captain thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
02:01:13.149 --> 02:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
Victor Muzzy I'm a captain with the
 
02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
state police and oversee the Justice
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
information Bureau and in that Bureau is
 
02:01:19.629 --> 02:01:19.639 align:start position:0%
the ncic unit and uh what folks commonly
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
referred to as spots and so I'm I'm here
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
to represent the state police who takes
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
no position on this particular Bill and
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative troia for uh
 
02:01:29.189 --> 02:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
that little bit of information about the
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
contact person notification program we
 
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:33.320 align:start position:0%
are currently working through the
 
02:01:35.229 --> 02:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
logistics of that I see a lot of
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
similarities here with the way this bill
 
02:01:38.589 --> 02:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
is written relative to how we're going
 
02:01:41.069 --> 02:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
to Institute that process and I I see
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
that uh the fiscal note um from the
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety has been responded
 
02:01:48.910 --> 02:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
to I think the differences between what
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
I understand the contact notification
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
person program to become in this is this
 
02:01:56.830 --> 02:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
has the potential of being very labor
 
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
intensive more so than the contact
 
02:02:00.510 --> 02:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
person notification and I I'm not a
 
02:02:02.589 --> 02:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
mental health uh expert and I don't work
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
in the field um and unfortunately I have
 
02:02:06.270 --> 02:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
not yet been CIT trained which I think
 
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
you'll hear some testimony on here but
 
02:02:11.109 --> 02:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
as I understand the logistics of
 
02:02:14.430 --> 02:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
admissions versus orders um and and how
 
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
that has the potential of being labor
 
02:02:18.669 --> 02:02:18.679 align:start position:0%
intensive I would say that the fiscal
 
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
note probably needs to speak to
 
02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
additional resources that the state
 
02:02:24.189 --> 02:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
police would need to ensure the
 
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
timeliness of um some of these
 
02:02:28.669 --> 02:02:28.679 align:start position:0%
notifications and and orders and things
 
02:02:31.069 --> 02:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
and making sure that the database or the
 
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
file or whatever happens to come from
 
02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
this this bill should it be enacted um
 
02:02:37.390 --> 02:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
can be maintained and so I would add
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
that our our fiscal note is probably
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
relatively conservative as I read it uh
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
this has the potential of of needing
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
some more resources that maybe weren't
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
identified initially uh in the fiscal
 
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:54.510 --> 02:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that's all I can offer I'll
 
02:02:57.629 --> 02:02:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
questions do you see the potential um
 
02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
for the system you're currently
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
implementing to be used for a a
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
limited a limited use um what we're
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish without getting all
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
the other information as far as
 
02:03:15.870 --> 02:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
notifying law enforcement that there's a
 
02:03:18.149 --> 02:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
an issue if someone voluntarily says I'd
 
02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
like to be um law enforcement to know
 
02:03:22.149 --> 02:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
that I've got a a history of mental
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
health yeah I think I think the
 
02:03:26.669 --> 02:03:26.679 align:start position:0%
difference between what's here in that
 
02:03:28.589 --> 02:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
program is that's a voluntary and so
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
because it's voluntary it's much easier
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
to maintain it's much easier to manage
 
02:03:35.709 --> 02:03:35.719 align:start position:0%
um the information the sensitivity of
 
02:03:37.629 --> 02:03:37.639 align:start position:0%
the information becomes desensitized I
 
02:03:38.910 --> 02:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
guess for lack of a better term when
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
somebody volunteers to share that with
 
02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
us I will say that again not having any
 
02:03:45.709 --> 02:03:45.719 align:start position:0%
expertise in the area if I see a
 
02:03:48.549 --> 02:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
commitment order um come up you know as
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
a hit in a database or a file or
 
02:03:51.310 --> 02:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
something like that I may or may not
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
know what to do with that so I may have
 
02:03:54.910 --> 02:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
to call a trooper or officer next to me
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
to come and say hey could you help me
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
interact with this person or what have
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
you and so um as we've started to
 
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
implement the contact person
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
notification program there the the idea
 
02:04:06.669 --> 02:04:06.679 align:start position:0%
behind that is there's information there
 
02:04:08.549 --> 02:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
that's user friendly I'll call it or
 
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
useful to let's say untrained officers
 
02:04:12.910 --> 02:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
to know either hey here's a person that
 
02:04:14.430 --> 02:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
you can contact who can help you
 
02:04:16.229 --> 02:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
interact with this person or or you know
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
deal with this person or hear some
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
general information in sort of layman's
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
terms um as as to what would be useful
 
02:04:22.159 --> 02:04:22.870 align:start position:0%
terms um as as to what would be useful
and

02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
so this as I understand it would be a
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
little bit more regimented um orders and
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
things as I understood from the
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
testimony would be have sensitive
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
information in I may or may not know
 
02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
what that means and how to deal um more
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
effectively with someone that
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
that you know um has a diagnosis or has
 
02:04:42.549 --> 02:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
has some information in that commitment
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
order so I think what this is intending
 
02:04:47.470 --> 02:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
to do uh much to the testimony we heard
 
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
this bill here is is look looking to
 
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
bridge the gap where you've got people
 
02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
that haven't voluntarily signed up but
 
02:04:56.910 --> 02:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
maybe law enforcement should know about
 
02:04:58.350 --> 02:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
them and you know how to deal with them
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
or something about them and so hopefully
 
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee that's formed can sort
 
02:05:05.709 --> 02:05:05.719 align:start position:0%
of come to some happy medium where um
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
that information can be shared and
 
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
obtained for the right reasons but not
 
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
violate any privacy issues or any any
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
Hippa issues or things like that um to
 
02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
help you know collectively resolve
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the the circumstance may be
 
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
currently can you tell us what what is
 
02:05:24.589 --> 02:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
entered into spots when an involuntary
 
02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
commitment order is
 
02:05:29.069 --> 02:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
issued it's been a while since I've done
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
real police work like out on the road
 
02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
but um as I understand it there's
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
there's a file I think that's um there
 
02:05:38.589 --> 02:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know that I've even run
 
02:05:40.350 --> 02:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
into that very often to say that there's
 
02:05:43.229 --> 02:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
been an IA issued for someone um that's
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
yet to have been served um I would
 
02:05:47.310 --> 02:05:47.320 align:start position:0%
suspect it's another state hot file what
 
02:05:49.030 --> 02:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
we call Hot file that probably gives us
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
that information and likely a phone
 
02:05:52.990 --> 02:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
number to call or the order itself that
 
02:05:54.990 --> 02:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
we would serve upon that person and take
 
02:05:57.790 --> 02:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
them into custody for that reason so I
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
don't think the information that's
 
02:06:02.549 --> 02:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
contained in spots necessarily
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
says has any contents of what the Ia is
 
02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
or the the affidavit I'll say that goes
 
02:06:08.589 --> 02:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
along with that it simply says they have
 
02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
an order so it's generic I guess to that
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
extent but as best my memory serves me
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman it's been a couple days okay
 
02:06:17.599 --> 02:06:20.830 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman it's been a couple days okay
um

02:06:20.830 --> 02:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
any further
 
02:06:34.270 --> 02:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
testimony um anyone else wishing to
 
02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
testify in this bill who has not
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:52.510 align:start position:0%
 
ahead

02:06:52.510 --> 02:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to answer because there
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
was a couple questions that I just think
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
is really important so if there is an
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
active iea on file um so talking so from
 
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
the first time this young woman was
 
02:07:06.350 --> 02:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
arrested um when I first started having
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
these conversations there was an active
 
02:07:13.229 --> 02:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
iea on file and unfortunately where the
 
02:07:15.069 --> 02:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
police department where she was
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
arrested her mom kept calling and saying
 
02:07:19.229 --> 02:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
she has an active
 
02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:21.719 align:start position:0%
they couldn't find that information da
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
so when he was trying to speak about how
 
02:07:26.790 --> 02:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
that is how the how they're speaking to
 
02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
each other it wasn't speaking to each
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
other only until she was actually in the
 
02:07:34.950 --> 02:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
jail is then they realized that there
 
02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
was an active iea on file so I don't
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
want anyone's privacy to be that's
 
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's not the point of this and there's
 
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
no like fullon information and his
 
02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
history of mental illness where we
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
target or any of that kind of stuff I'm
 
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
saying like if at the time of an arrest
 
02:07:58.750 --> 02:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
for someone to know that there is an
 
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
active iea and that's not a clearcut
 
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
right now and that's where the Gap is
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
and then if you are incarcerated because
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
that this is where the other piece comes
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
in the history piece is important and
 
02:08:17.069 --> 02:08:17.079 align:start position:0%
you've had 10 ieas before and you're in
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
jail now um um for a new charge that
 
02:08:24.629 --> 02:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
kind of information is probably helpful
 
02:08:27.310 --> 02:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
um for someone that's a a in a sense
 
02:08:29.470 --> 02:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
continues to get arrested continues to
 
02:08:31.950 --> 02:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
be in and out of of treatment that's
 
02:08:34.189 --> 02:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
what I was saying having that backstory
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
is important once you're past the point
 
02:08:38.430 --> 02:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
of just an initial arrest where you're
 
02:08:39.990 --> 02:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
held in a police department and that
 
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
you're at a county jail so I just wanted
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
to be clear about that okay so what you
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
want is you want the arresting or the
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
encountering police off officer to know
 
02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
that there either is an active iea or
 
02:08:55.709 --> 02:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
was an active IA and if they're sent
 
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
over to the county jail that they're
 
02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
also aware they won't be able to get the
 
02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
whole backstory about the I but they'll
 
02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
at least know it was there and be able
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
to inquire of the person what their
 
02:09:06.830 --> 02:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
history is is that correct so how the
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
ieas work so this mother has had to do
 
02:09:12.910 --> 02:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
this more than 10 times so her daughters
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
had more than 10 ieas because you have
 
02:09:18.669 --> 02:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
to understand so they're in place then
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
they then they expire she's arrested she
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
goes back into the hospital it's this
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
Perpetual thing and just the level of
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
communication still keeping everybody's
 
02:09:30.430 --> 02:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
privacy so we can help all entities here
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
I think is very
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
important okay can
 
02:09:38.669 --> 02:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
you could you look at RSA 106 b35 while
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
you're in the room and just um talk to
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
me after and see if you think that
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
there's any way to work with that if
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
it's already RSA 106 106 um B colon 35
 
02:09:51.709 --> 02:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
okay and representative it comes up
 
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
under 36 though just okay and
 
02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative here GA you have a
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
question yes uh thank you for taking my
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
question um does the mother have
 
02:10:02.549 --> 02:10:02.559 align:start position:0%
guardianship over her daughter she does
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
not um do you know if she
 
02:10:09.310 --> 02:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
applied she did um but she'd rather
 
02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
because she's she's uh she's got her own
 
02:10:15.149 --> 02:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
she's got a um in a sense a terminal
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
illness so she wants to make sure that
 
02:10:19.310 --> 02:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
that's why she's really focused on the
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
state guardianship at this
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
point all right thank you represent
 
02:10:27.629 --> 02:10:27.639 align:start position:0%
Newman I have a question this morning or
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
comment for the chair about your
 
02:10:32.189 --> 02:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
previous question that you had I mean I
 
02:10:34.830 --> 02:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
would be interested in if anybody has
 
02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
information as is there some simple iea
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
history or something like that that
 
02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
would not violate the Privacy type
 
02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
things just give an indication okay
 
02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
let's start looking for whatever is
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
available yeah that's exactly what I was
 
02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
thinking something at least to kind of
 
02:10:54.069 --> 02:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
trigger them to look further into know
 
02:10:54.079 --> 02:10:54.870 align:start position:0%
trigger them to look further into know
thank

02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%

hb1
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
1527 the purple paint bill um so the
 
02:12:31.709 --> 02:12:31.719 align:start position:0%
problem and I and this we I brought this
 
02:12:34.270 --> 02:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
forward a couple years ago the problem
 
02:12:38.589 --> 02:12:38.599 align:start position:0%
is that for land owners in this state
 
02:12:40.750 --> 02:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
not all land owners but many land owners
 
02:12:43.870 --> 02:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
land owners who maybe have physical
 
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
difficulties um getting high up into a
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
tree to put up up a a no trespassing
 
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
sign hammering Nails into trees um
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
physical limitations elderly land owners
 
02:12:59.229 --> 02:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
a lot um as well as to some extent land
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
owners that may have difficulty buying
 
02:13:04.750 --> 02:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
enough signs to post all of their land
 
02:13:07.629 --> 02:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
every hundred yards uh posting as is
 
02:13:11.390 --> 02:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
required by current law can be fairly
 
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
difficult and that makes it a barrier a
 
02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
a hurdle to them exercising their
 
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
private property rights to keep out
 
02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
trespassers except for um obviously
 
02:13:25.390 --> 02:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
people that they in individually welcome
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
onto their land in addition and probably
 
02:13:28.079 --> 02:13:30.069 align:start position:0%
onto their land in addition and probably
more

02:13:30.069 --> 02:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:13:31.870 --> 02:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
significantly the signs that we
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
currently require in our posting uh
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
frequently get uh worn down very quickly
 
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
because of weather especially New
 
02:13:43.310 --> 02:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
England weather um animals will chew on
 
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
them and also there has been um a
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
history of signs being tampered with um
 
02:13:52.270 --> 02:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
there's been at least a couple of cases
 
02:13:55.149 --> 02:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
where in particular Hunters um have
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
taken down one of the signs that are
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
required every hundred yards and once a
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
sign is taken down technically it's not
 
02:14:04.030 --> 02:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
legally correctly posted anymore and
 
02:14:06.430 --> 02:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
then they can follow their their prey
 
02:14:09.709 --> 02:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
onto that land technically so because
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
that's happened a number of states 22
 
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
actually have passed um purple paint
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
laws or some of them actually use orange
 
02:14:19.629 --> 02:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
paint but most of them use purple paint
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
so many of them in fact that major
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
brands like kryon and Rustoleum
 
02:14:26.669 --> 02:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
specifically create a purple color for
 
02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
the posting of land um those states are
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
Alabama Arkansas Arizona Florida Idaho
 
02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
Illinois Indiana Kansas Louisiana Maine
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
our neighbors Maryland Montana Nevada
 
02:14:43.709 --> 02:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
North Carolina Oregon Pennsylvania South
 
02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
Carolina Tennessee Texas Utah Virginia
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
and West Virginia so
 
02:14:50.910 --> 02:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
obviously states in the Northeast like
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
US states out west states to the South
 
02:14:56.709 --> 02:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
all over the country Montana and Texas
 
02:14:58.470 --> 02:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
in particular being quite famous for
 
02:15:01.149 --> 02:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
their excellent hunting opportunities um
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
and also States as small as Maryland so
 
02:15:07.950 --> 02:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
all over the place um this has
 
02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
worked so I just quickly go through this
 
02:15:12.149 --> 02:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
bill it's slightly different than the
 
02:15:13.470 --> 02:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
one a couple years ago not that
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
everybody was here for that one so what
 
02:15:20.229 --> 02:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
this does is allows as an additional
 
02:15:22.549 --> 02:15:22.559 align:start position:0%
method specifically for the purposes of
 
02:15:25.390 --> 02:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
no TR trespassing or in other words ACC
 
02:15:29.149 --> 02:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
access By Invitation Only um purple
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
paint you can still use the signs if you
 
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
want that's fine um and for the first
 
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
year it has like a kind of grace period
 
02:15:40.109 --> 02:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
where the purple paint alone is not
 
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient you'll have to still use a
 
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
sign um at the major entrances and
 
02:15:48.030 --> 02:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
during that first year a violation of of
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
that trespassing will just be considered
 
02:15:52.830 --> 02:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
a violation rather than an um a higher
 
02:15:56.549 --> 02:15:56.559 align:start position:0%
level offense so you have that nice
 
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:04.030 --> 02:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
period I want to address some of the
 
02:16:06.790 --> 02:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
questions that I I got and the arguments
 
02:16:09.549 --> 02:16:09.559 align:start position:0%
that um came up last year or the last
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
term I should say so one of the
 
02:16:14.709 --> 02:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
questions is well how does how do you
 
02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
unpost your land if you've decided to
 
02:16:18.030 --> 02:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
post and then change your mind or you
 
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
sell the property how does the future
 
02:16:22.270 --> 02:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
property owner unpost your land brown
 
02:16:25.229 --> 02:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
paint you post you just go back over
 
02:16:27.430 --> 02:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
with brown paint because just like it's
 
02:16:30.270 --> 02:16:30.280 align:start position:0%
very easy much easier to post your land
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
with a simple spray of purple paint
 
02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
going back over with brown paint is
 
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
equally easier than taking down signs
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
that are nailed to a tree every hundred
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
yards another question that was received
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
well what about the color blind and I
 
02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
don't know why this seems to be a
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
sticking point considering 22 States use
 
02:16:51.150 --> 02:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
this but it's been shown that the color
 
02:16:53.150 --> 02:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
bline can distinguish The Color Purple
 
02:16:55.629 --> 02:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
from say the brown of a tree or the
 
02:16:59.870 --> 02:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
white of a post or um or black or gray
 
02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
so they seem to see purple darker than
 
02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
someone who is not color blind but they
 
02:17:08.790 --> 02:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
can distinguish the difference another
 
02:17:10.509 --> 02:17:10.519 align:start position:0%
question has been Trail markings are
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
there purple Trail markings there may in
 
02:17:15.709 --> 02:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
some locations in the state be purple
 
02:17:17.870 --> 02:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
dots or purple squares or triang angles
 
02:17:19.629 --> 02:17:19.639 align:start position:0%
that are Trail marking this is very
 
02:17:21.790 --> 02:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
specific it's specific across all the 22
 
02:17:25.509 --> 02:17:25.519 align:start position:0%
States it has to be an inch wide stripe
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
that goes at a certain height on the
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
tree 3 to 5 feet tall that is a certain
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
length at least 8 in so that we do not
 
02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
have as Trail markings that specific
 
02:17:41.230 --> 02:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
stripe um further the uh unlike signs
 
02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
purple paint does not damage wood so if
 
02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
you want to Lumber your or harvest your
 
02:17:48.669 --> 02:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
Timber later on you are actually keeping
 
02:17:52.910 --> 02:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
that um wood quality higher for later so
 
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
that also enables Property Owners to
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
take to make the most of their private
 
02:18:00.270 --> 02:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
property um and then another argument
 
02:18:02.750 --> 02:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
came about well wouldn't this confuse
 
02:18:06.110 --> 02:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
people it's a new way of posting land
 
02:18:08.349 --> 02:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
would there be confusion and acclamation
 
02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
problems and what have you again 22
 
02:18:13.070 --> 02:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
States use this virtually all uh
 
02:18:15.709 --> 02:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
virtually half of all states so it's a
 
02:18:18.389 --> 02:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
Well understood thing and as said Major
 
02:18:21.070 --> 02:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
Brands specifically create a color for
 
02:18:25.990 --> 02:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
this purpose but um in addition to
 
02:18:29.070 --> 02:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
that specifically what we heard last
 
02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:32.519 align:start position:0%
time was that Maine being our neighbors
 
02:18:34.469 --> 02:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
we're just having a terrible terrible
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
time with the law and they had
 
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
implemented it and there's so much
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
confusion it was so terrible so I
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
decided this year to go to the horse's
 
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
mouth myself so I contacted Maine Fish
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
and Wildlife and I reached out
 
02:18:48.990 --> 02:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
specifically to Corporal Chris McCabe
 
02:18:51.669 --> 02:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
who's the warden in charge of landowner
 
02:18:54.509 --> 02:18:54.519 align:start position:0%
relations as well as Colonel Dan Scott
 
02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
neither one indicated that they'd have
 
02:18:58.830 --> 02:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
any had any significant problems with
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
confusion certainly the law has not been
 
02:19:02.709 --> 02:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
repealed in Maine and it's been in
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
existence for quite a number of years
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
now um also the office of the warden
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
indicated to me that it's actually been
 
02:19:12.669 --> 02:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
a very beneficial law that it's helped
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
large tract owners uh post their land
 
02:19:18.669 --> 02:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
and that they has been no confusion
 
02:19:21.349 --> 02:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
because quite simply the the major
 
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
people who would be confused by it would
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
be Hunters but it's given in the hunter
 
02:19:27.629 --> 02:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
regulations every year hunting
 
02:19:30.110 --> 02:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
regulations change frequently every year
 
02:19:32.429 --> 02:19:32.439 align:start position:0%
so they give out those regulations
 
02:19:34.469 --> 02:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
Hunters are made aware of it and so that
 
02:19:37.629 --> 02:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
kind of negates any real
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
confusion and then the last thing that
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
had come out up was this idea that there
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
are these armies of rabid animal
 
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
activists that will now go out and Mark
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
other people's land that they don't own
 
02:19:55.349 --> 02:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
um to post no trespassing on that land
 
02:19:57.550 --> 02:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
um so first of all marking anyone else's
 
02:19:58.870 --> 02:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
property is already
 
02:20:01.349 --> 02:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
illegal um and while there have been a
 
02:20:03.389 --> 02:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
couple of cases of apparently Hunters
 
02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
removing other people's no trespassing
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
signs to trespass on that land um again
 
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
having reached out to Maine they have
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
not indicated to me that they've had any
 
02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
complaints of this act happening in the
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
other direction where people were
 
02:20:19.870 --> 02:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
posting other people's land against the
 
02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
land owner's wishes so um they can if if
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
there's these real like animal activists
 
02:20:28.750 --> 02:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
that are Rabbid and like these armies of
 
02:20:30.389 --> 02:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
animal activists it seems to me they'd
 
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
already be posting people's land like
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
okay if you're so passionate about doing
 
02:20:36.910 --> 02:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
this why aren't you hammering signs to a
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
tree just the same but more importantly
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
let's say that there are these armies
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
and they do Mark other people's land it
 
02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
is easier to go back over as the land
 
02:20:47.790 --> 02:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
owner and say no I don't want to post
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
this tree I don't want to post this land
 
02:20:51.790 --> 02:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
by going back over with that brown paint
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
then it is to go and pull down the sign
 
02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
right if someone's going to mark your
 
02:20:58.150 --> 02:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
land with a sign that's harder for you
 
02:20:59.710 --> 02:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
to remove and that's more damaging to
 
02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
your property than purple paint is
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
having said that I've offered to um the
 
02:21:06.990 --> 02:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
opposition who claims that this is their
 
02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
reason for opposing the bill an
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it more specifically
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
illegal because it's just generally
 
02:21:15.150 --> 02:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
illegal right now to damage other
 
02:21:17.469 --> 02:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
people's property but to make it more
 
02:21:18.990 --> 02:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
specifically illegal that you cannot
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
post someone else's property with a very
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
specific penalty and I was told that
 
02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
they were still against it anyway so um
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
I think that if you try to make the
 
02:21:30.990 --> 02:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
argument and address the argument and
 
02:21:33.550 --> 02:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
they say they're still against it then
 
02:21:34.910 --> 02:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
um that means that wasn't ever really
 
02:21:37.150 --> 02:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
their argument to begin with but at the
 
02:21:39.790 --> 02:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
end of the day this is about private
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
property rights uh New Hampshire has uh
 
02:21:47.309 --> 02:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
I think quite well um a kind of quasi
 
02:21:50.429 --> 02:21:50.439 align:start position:0%
socialist approach to land ownership
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
which is to say we have private property
 
02:21:55.309 --> 02:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
but unless a private property owner
 
02:21:57.030 --> 02:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
exercises their right over their
 
02:22:00.389 --> 02:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
property by default anyone can trespass
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
and enjoy that land now I do not oppose
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
that system at all I actually like that
 
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
system I'm not a hunter but I am a
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
horseback Trail Rider and I love going
 
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
wherever I like on Horseback including
 
02:22:17.469 --> 02:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
on farmers's property however if I
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
already know that the farmer doesn't
 
02:22:22.349 --> 02:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
want me on that property but for a
 
02:22:24.910 --> 02:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
technicality they were not able to post
 
02:22:27.790 --> 02:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
that land do I now still want to go on
 
02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
that land even though I know that owner
 
02:22:32.590 --> 02:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't want me there no I don't want
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
those conflicts and so that's really the
 
02:22:37.150 --> 02:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
heart of this because the opposition
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
will say including the department will
 
02:22:41.309 --> 02:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
say well this is about making sure that
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
we have as much access to as much land
 
02:22:45.550 --> 02:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
as possible we want to maintain as much
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
Public Access I agree I want that public
 
02:22:51.309 --> 02:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
access for myself for trail riding but
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say well I know you
 
02:22:55.389 --> 02:22:55.399 align:start position:0%
don't want me on your land but I'm going
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
to get on your land because you were not
 
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
able to properly post it in accordance
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
with your wishes because you didn't have
 
02:23:02.349 --> 02:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
the physical ability or the monetary
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
ability or somebody else tore down your
 
02:23:06.270 --> 02:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
signs or the weather tore down your
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
signs so I get to be on your property
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
even though I know you don't want to be
 
02:23:11.230 --> 02:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
on your property because all this is
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
doing is allowing Property Owners to
 
02:23:16.469 --> 02:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
exercise and express the wishes over
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
their property
 
02:23:20.190 --> 02:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
it's not convincing property owners that
 
02:23:21.790 --> 02:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't want people on their
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
property it's not taking any more land
 
02:23:27.469 --> 02:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
that is already um already that people
 
02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
want to have available it's not
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
convincing them to reduce that number
 
02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
it's just making it easier for them to
 
02:23:33.870 --> 02:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
express their
 
02:23:36.469 --> 02:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
wishes so I think it's a it's a really
 
02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
kind of bad practice to want to have
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
access to land that the owners that you
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
know the owners don't want you
 
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
on and with that
 
02:23:53.309 --> 02:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative Murray thank
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um I'm just wondering if
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's anything in this legislation
 
02:24:02.469 --> 02:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
that would prevent a property owner from
 
02:24:04.510 --> 02:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
wanting to still put no trespassing
 
02:24:06.429 --> 02:24:06.439 align:start position:0%
signs up on their property if they chose
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
to do so they totally can still put the
 
02:24:10.830 --> 02:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
lettered signs they can do both they can
 
02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
do one or the other there's this in
 
02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
between period where they would have to
 
02:24:17.110 --> 02:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
do if they wanted to do purple paint and
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
instead of doing a sign every 100 yards
 
02:24:20.510 --> 02:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
they could do purple paint every hundred
 
02:24:23.070 --> 02:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
yards and then a sign at the entrances
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
and that's for a year to to reduce the
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
potential for like overnight confusion
 
02:24:31.150 --> 02:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
um but no they can still have the option
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
and further if there's any specifically
 
02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited activity um then that would
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
require a sign so the purple paint is
 
02:24:42.910 --> 02:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
only for Access By Invitation Only no
 
02:24:45.150 --> 02:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
trespassing to
 
02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
others representative site
 
02:24:50.429 --> 02:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
Tech so if I want to go hunting I'd
 
02:24:53.309 --> 02:24:53.319 align:start position:0%
bring a can of brown paint with me well
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
that would be illegal as it is currently
 
02:24:58.349 --> 02:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
sign I I I certainly hope you aren't
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting that you would engage in
 
02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
illegal activity not at all thank you we

I've uh I've been hunting in New
 
02:26:01.269 --> 02:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since uh about the age of 12
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's it's well over 50 years
 
02:26:06.670 --> 02:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
and um you know I've also hunted Maine
 
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
and uh you know about 20 years ago they
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
did do the purple paint bill and the
 
02:26:12.429 --> 02:26:12.439 align:start position:0%
conservation officers that I've talked
 
02:26:14.110 --> 02:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
to there said it was an absolute
 
02:26:16.429 --> 02:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
nightmare uh you know you can talk about
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
purple paint uh being uh you know uh
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
very visible on on some trees but others
 
02:26:24.110 --> 02:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's not you you put purple on Gray and
 
02:26:26.269 --> 02:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know it doesn't show very well
 
02:26:28.670 --> 02:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
purple paint will also deteriorate under
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
under weather conditions okay the uh the
 
02:26:33.710 --> 02:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
signs that uh representative read talked
 
02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
about uh I know some I know there some
 
02:26:39.070 --> 02:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
signs that are 20 years old and are they
 
02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
weathered yeah but they're still very
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
visible and still in pretty darn good
 
02:26:44.510 --> 02:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
shape uh the the the materials they're
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
made out of today are are pretty good
 
02:26:51.630 --> 02:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
um I've got a a story to tell you uh
 
02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
about uh people posting that uh that
 
02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
didn't own the land you know this past
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
hunting season my brother was out
 
02:27:00.870 --> 02:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
hunting and uh he went in the woods and
 
02:27:03.510 --> 02:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know walked down a Woods Road and
 
02:27:04.870 --> 02:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
an hour and a half later he got a call
 
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
from the dairy police asking him to come
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
out and uh he came out of the woods and
 
02:27:11.309 --> 02:27:11.319 align:start position:0%
there were two brand new posters about
 
02:27:13.349 --> 02:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
20 ft from the back of his truck and 20t
 
02:27:15.870 --> 02:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
from the the front of it and this cop
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
was going to run him for crial
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
trespass the problem being my brother's
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
a 38-year federal employee 3 months away
 
02:27:26.110 --> 02:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
from from uh getting his pension and if
 
02:27:28.750 --> 02:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
if he was in fact uh arrested for a MISD
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
demean of uh that pension would at at
 
02:27:33.389 --> 02:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
the very least would have been put on
 
02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
hold uh he would have had to spend
 
02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
$5,000 to be found not guilty and um you
 
02:27:41.670 --> 02:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
know and and if he was found guilty he'd
 
02:27:44.309 --> 02:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
lose that pension okay the neighbors put
 
02:27:47.710 --> 02:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
the put this put the sign up um you know
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
he he spoke to the police officer and
 
02:27:51.870 --> 02:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
more or less U you know verbally proved
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
how that was it was you know drywall
 
02:27:56.349 --> 02:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
screws in the in the tree and uh it had
 
02:27:57.990 --> 02:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
been raining for 4 days and we all know
 
02:27:59.469 --> 02:27:59.479 align:start position:0%
what happens to drywall screws when they
 
02:28:01.269 --> 02:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
get wet you know they they rust up real
 
02:28:04.110 --> 02:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
fast they make a mess and uh he proved
 
02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
his innocence there uh the next day he
 
02:28:09.030 --> 02:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
went back to to hunt that same spot and
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
he left a note on the window of his of
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
his truck saying I have permission to
 
02:28:13.710 --> 02:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
hunt this from the and he put the
 
02:28:16.830 --> 02:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
owner's name okay and uh you know
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
another cop shows up and he calls him
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
and he's going to run him for for
 
02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
Criminal Trespass too and um you know
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
the way he got the the owner's name my
 
02:28:27.630 --> 02:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
other brother was he was talking to him
 
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
and he knew the the owner of the
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
property so anyway um you know uh it's
 
02:28:34.670 --> 02:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
real easy for somebody to if it's real
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
easy to put up a sign which takes
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
probably three or four minutes each you
 
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
have to bring a ladder out and all the
 
02:28:40.870 --> 02:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
rest of it and you're very visible to
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
everybody that's going by how
 
02:28:46.750 --> 02:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
quick you know how how many times are we
 
02:28:48.910 --> 02:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
going to see that happen okay and and
 
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
innocent people having a having to go
 
02:28:53.670 --> 02:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
through go through a court proceeding in
 
02:28:55.950 --> 02:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
order to prove their innocence uh you
 
02:28:58.510 --> 02:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
know I I think it happens an awful lot
 
02:29:00.190 --> 02:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
and uh you know yes I did have an
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to a bill to uh to to
 
02:29:05.230 --> 02:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
criminalize uh that and put penalties to
 
02:29:07.269 --> 02:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
to uh posting a property he didn't own
 
02:29:10.070 --> 02:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
but was found on Germaine but anyway um
 
02:29:11.550 --> 02:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
you know this kind of stuff does happen
 
02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire uh as far as our
 
02:29:16.830 --> 02:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
posting laws go uh fishing game uh don't
 
02:29:18.630 --> 02:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
require you to you know go all the way
 
02:29:19.950 --> 02:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
on your property as long as you're
 
02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
you're you're posting at reasonable uh
 
02:29:25.309 --> 02:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
entry points uh they will enforce it and
 
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
um you know and people have been have
 
02:29:29.550 --> 02:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
been cited for it and uh you know this
 
02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
is a this this is something that's going
 
02:29:34.269 --> 02:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
to cause a bigger problem and uh you
 
02:29:36.030 --> 02:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
know in my in my opinion you know this
 
02:29:38.269 --> 02:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
is an animal rights Bill nothing more
 
02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
nothing less and uh you know it's trying
 
02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
to stop hunting and hunting is an
 
02:29:44.190 --> 02:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
important tool for for for fishing game
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know we can't we can't get the do's
 
02:29:47.950 --> 02:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
to line up and take birth control you
 
02:29:49.710 --> 02:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
know hunting is the only way to keep the
 
02:29:52.510 --> 02:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
populations down and um you know we've
 
02:29:55.630 --> 02:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
uh we we can't be limiting access to to
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
to open land to to people who want to
 
02:30:02.269 --> 02:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:09.630 --> 02:30:09.640 align:start position:0%

option simply as another option but as
 
02:30:54.710 --> 02:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
we as we looked at it
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
further it was something that we we
 
02:31:02.469 --> 02:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh it's a direction we didn't want to go
 
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
we we think that if a a land owner is
 
02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
going to deny access on the property
 
02:31:09.309 --> 02:31:09.319 align:start position:0%
that they should as the current Law
 
02:31:11.950 --> 02:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
requires that they post with their name
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
and an address a contact
 
02:31:16.910 --> 02:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
information it's we we as an
 
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
organization we support the tradition of
 
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
of Open Access in the
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
state the the way that this bill is
 
02:31:27.790 --> 02:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
proposed is that it's a it's a it's a
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
blanket no trespassing what we encourage
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
our members to do is if you want to post
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
property and if you is that to to post
 
02:31:39.469 --> 02:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
it no trespassing without landowner
 
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
permission then it elabs us as land
 
02:31:44.630 --> 02:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
owners to have a conversation with with
 
02:31:47.230 --> 02:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
the individual wishing to act access the
 
02:31:50.269 --> 02:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
property it's
 
02:31:54.510 --> 02:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
um and I want to be clear that though we
 
02:31:58.429 --> 02:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
uh we we we encourage Open Access as as
 
02:32:01.830 --> 02:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
a right excuse me as as a as a privilege
 
02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
I mean not as a right um um that said we
 
02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
we certainly support the the right of
 
02:32:11.790 --> 02:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
land owners to to deny deny access but
 
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
we we just again uh we just do not
 
02:32:17.830 --> 02:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
believe this is a a direct that we we
 
02:32:20.309 --> 02:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
want to go and I'll I'll leave it at
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
that and appreciate your your time and
 
02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
attention thank you thank you Mr Johnson
 
02:32:29.790 --> 02:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
um respectfully I should have asked it
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
of the sponsor but I I wasn't able to
 
02:32:36.990 --> 02:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
write fast enough so um if do we now
 
02:32:38.710 --> 02:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
does the State of New Hampshire now
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
currently have more than one option of
 
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
posting or is it just the the signs that
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
we always believe this what is laid out
 
02:32:49.429 --> 02:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
in the current existing statute yes okay
 
02:32:53.870 --> 02:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
so if if it was allowed to have two
 
02:32:53.880 --> 02:32:54.910 align:start position:0%
so if if it was allowed to have two
different

02:32:54.910 --> 02:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:32:57.389 --> 02:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
options would that cause confusion if a
 
02:32:59.190 --> 02:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
person decided they didn't want to have
 
02:33:00.790 --> 02:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
it posted anymore if they did want to
 
02:33:02.309 --> 02:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
post and they already had one or the
 
02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
other I suppose it could okay thank you
 
02:33:10.670 --> 02:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
any any questions anybody else thank you
 
02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:13.070 align:start position:0%
any any questions anybody else thank you
very

02:33:13.070 --> 02:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:15.150 --> 02:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
02:33:15.160 --> 02:33:22.309 align:start position:0%
much representative
Phillips

02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:24.070 --> 02:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
good morning to the committee um
 
02:33:25.750 --> 02:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative Emily Phillips of
 
02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 7 Fremont New Hampshire I
 
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
support this bill I'm a co-sponsor uh
 
02:33:32.190 --> 02:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
for me if it's legal in another state it
 
02:33:33.870 --> 02:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
should be legal in the free estate in
 
02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
the union so that's why I'm on board
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
here um this is about
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
options there's nothing stopping a land
 
02:33:42.590 --> 02:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
owner from continuing with what's been
 
02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
going on posting their information um I
 
02:33:47.950 --> 02:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
see that this as an option uh it's
 
02:33:49.469 --> 02:33:49.479 align:start position:0%
working in other states so let's bring
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
it here um for all the reasons all the
 
02:33:53.429 --> 02:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
points that I was going to make have
 
02:33:55.309 --> 02:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
been made besides what I just said and
 
02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
um in addition um excuse me say you're
 
02:34:03.070 --> 02:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
on a property and you're hunting um I'm
 
02:34:05.670 --> 02:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
obviously for hunting um but I'm just
 
02:34:07.230 --> 02:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
saying if you need to contact a land
 
02:34:09.070 --> 02:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
owner and you've G gone onto a property
 
02:34:11.389 --> 02:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
that is only posted with purple paint
 
02:34:15.349 --> 02:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
there are um online access through towns
 
02:34:17.710 --> 02:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
that you can register find out who owns
 
02:34:19.630 --> 02:34:19.640 align:start position:0%
that land so there is option so even
 
02:34:21.630 --> 02:34:21.640 align:start position:0%
though so we talk about privacy right
 
02:34:22.830 --> 02:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
like if you if you if you don't want to
 
02:34:24.670 --> 02:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
post a sign with your with the Landover
 
02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
information you can still access that
 
02:34:28.469 --> 02:34:28.479 align:start position:0%
information through the town records so
 
02:34:31.070 --> 02:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see this as an issue I I'm again
 
02:34:32.389 --> 02:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
I support this bill I'm happy to take
 
02:34:33.630 --> 02:34:33.640 align:start position:0%
questions I'm not sure if I can answer
 
02:34:37.710 --> 02:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:39.750 --> 02:34:39.760 align:start position:0%

02:35:12.190 --> 02:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I am a volunteer with an
 
02:35:14.070 --> 02:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
animal advocacy
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
organization um I support this bill I
 
02:35:18.990 --> 02:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
support giving land owners a convenient
 
02:35:21.550 --> 02:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
economical uh weather tamper resistant
 
02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
alternative to putting up
 
02:35:25.910 --> 02:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
signs um the organization that I
 
02:35:28.469 --> 02:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
volunteer with we provide information
 
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
resources and supplies to people who are
 
02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
looking to coexist with
 
02:35:35.870 --> 02:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
wildlife and one of our programs is to
 
02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
offer people free no hunting signs we
 
02:35:41.429 --> 02:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
have a form that people can fill out and
 
02:35:43.309 --> 02:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
request these signs tell tell us about
 
02:35:45.349 --> 02:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
their property we figure out how many
 
02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:51.309 --> 02:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
them on this form there's like a little
 
02:35:55.230 --> 02:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
comments box and um often people will
 
02:35:58.030 --> 02:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
write something you know extraneous make
 
02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
comments about why they want the signs
 
02:36:03.190 --> 02:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
Etc so I just went back through my
 
02:36:05.670 --> 02:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
database of all the requests that we we
 
02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
got from people asking for signs and
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
just look for some of those comments
 
02:36:10.750 --> 02:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
that I was
 
02:36:13.110 --> 02:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
remembering that would sort of back up
 
02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
the need for paint as an alternative to
 
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
the tyvec signs which is what most
 
02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:20.510 align:start position:0%
the tyvec signs which is what most
people

02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
use and so I found a bunch I'm just
 
02:36:27.070 --> 02:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
going to read eight little quotes from
 
02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:27.950 align:start position:0%
going to read eight little quotes from
eight

02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
eight
 
02:36:29.830 --> 02:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
landowners I'll just give you their
 
02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
first name I have all their information
 
02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
myself so you know and these are
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
unsolicited comments as
 
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
well so here we have Nancy and Chester
 
02:36:43.110 --> 02:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
she says I posted some last year used
 
02:36:45.590 --> 02:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
last four this week they keep get they
 
02:36:47.950 --> 02:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
keep taking them down or weather
 
02:36:50.910 --> 02:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
destroys them and then we have an e
 
02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
Walsh in marac we have to continuously
 
02:36:53.880 --> 02:36:55.349 align:start position:0%
Walsh in marac we have to continuously
repost

02:36:55.349 --> 02:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
repost
 
02:36:58.950 --> 02:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
signs uh an L Landy and Dunbarton max
 
02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
number of signs please they mysteriously
 
02:37:03.150 --> 02:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
disappear during hunting
 
02:37:06.349 --> 02:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
season uh m mcy in
 
02:37:09.070 --> 02:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
Franconia uh need the full 50 I've
 
02:37:11.070 --> 02:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
posted in the past those signs have
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
weathered away I used a full role Sherry
 
02:37:18.190 --> 02:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
and this is the fifth person we post but
 
02:37:19.550 --> 02:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
people tear them down and we keep
 
02:37:22.750 --> 02:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
putting them back up an and Sharon
 
02:37:25.150 --> 02:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
posted in the past but most Signs Now
 
02:37:28.030 --> 02:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
gone to due to weather and Hunters Judy
 
02:37:30.790 --> 02:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
and Auburn Hunters steal my signs left a
 
02:37:33.870 --> 02:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
left a deer skull on my tree U and then
 
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
grayon Andover 150 acre property which
 
02:37:38.990 --> 02:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
we try to keep posted but need to
 
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
replace about a quarter of the signs
 
02:37:43.389 --> 02:37:43.399 align:start position:0%
every year so that's a lot of Labor and
 
02:37:44.590 --> 02:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
I think someone mentioned some of these
 
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
people are elderly
 
02:37:50.670 --> 02:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
um and also paint is not really going to
 
02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
be that much quicker to apply than signs
 
02:37:54.830 --> 02:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
if anyone's done a lot of spray painting
 
02:37:56.309 --> 02:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
you got to keep shaking the can you got
 
02:37:57.870 --> 02:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
to keep cleaning the nozzle so I don't
 
02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
see that someone um with bad intentions
 
02:38:02.510 --> 02:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
is going to be able to do something
 
02:38:05.630 --> 02:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
criminal any easier than with the
 
02:38:08.950 --> 02:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
signs and as to contact information so
 
02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
the law says you need to have your name
 
02:38:12.750 --> 02:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
and address on the signs uh the signs
 
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
are honored even if a person chooses to
 
02:38:16.510 --> 02:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
leave that information off
 
02:38:18.990 --> 02:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
my signs say obrien and my street
 
02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
address I have my property posted if
 
02:38:24.030 --> 02:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to contact me from that
 
02:38:26.269 --> 02:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
that information how would they do it
 
02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
obrien and my street address they can't
 
02:38:30.990 --> 02:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to use the databases like
 
02:38:33.870 --> 02:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
this woman for me
 
02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned and one last thing um people
 
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
have talked about how confusing it's
 
02:38:40.190 --> 02:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
going to be nobody's going to know what
 
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
the purple paint means fishing game is
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
extremely good at at um disseminating
 
02:38:47.830 --> 02:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
information and letting people know what
 
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
has changed we had changes in the rules
 
02:38:53.429 --> 02:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
around uh tree stands this year it comes
 
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
out the rules have changed here how
 
02:38:57.349 --> 02:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
here's how it's going to work this year
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
and the hunters they're very used to
 
02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing thank you and I'll
 
02:39:02.349 --> 02:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
take questions if anyone has
 
02:39:04.309 --> 02:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
any represent
 
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
Pro what happens if I'm not a hunter and
 
02:39:11.309 --> 02:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:13.349 --> 02:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
is why would you need to know if you
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
weren't a
 
02:39:18.230 --> 02:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
hunter I like to hike oh
 
02:39:21.710 --> 02:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
okay well um I guess we'd have to have a
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
way of getting that information out to
 
02:39:28.429 --> 02:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:31.269 --> 02:39:31.279 align:start position:0%
recreationally representative
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
Jamon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:39:35.349 --> 02:39:35.359 align:start position:0%

02:39:41.830 --> 02:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
least seven trails in Rockingham County
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
that use purple as a blaze for that
 
02:39:47.950 --> 02:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
trail no I'm not I'm not an expert on
 
02:39:50.110 --> 02:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
all the different Blaze colors but I
 
02:39:54.030 --> 02:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:14.560 align:start position:0%

stock

02:40:22.750 --> 02:40:22.760 align:start position:0%

and thank you for the opportunity to

come here and speak to you today in
 
02:40:38.030 --> 02:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
02:40:41.950 --> 02:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
1527 um our our members we are we
 
02:40:43.469 --> 02:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
represent Timberland owners in the
 
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
forest products businesses our members
 
02:40:48.269 --> 02:40:48.279 align:start position:0%
own Andor manage about I'd say about a
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
million Acres across the state of New
 
02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:52.830 align:start position:0%
million Acres across the state of New
Hampshire

02:40:52.830 --> 02:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
and you know I don't I won't reiterate
 
02:40:58.110 --> 02:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the comments that Rob
 
02:41:01.870 --> 02:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
Johnson had raised we we agree with I
 
02:41:05.469 --> 02:41:05.479 align:start position:0%
think representative p p raised a a
 
02:41:08.510 --> 02:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
great qu issue and and as did
 
02:41:10.269 --> 02:41:10.279 align:start position:0%
representative love when he earlier
 
02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
spoke about some of the confusion we
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
have land owners that own land in other
 
02:41:18.110 --> 02:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
states with purple paint laws and they
 
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
when this came to our policy committee
 
02:41:21.750 --> 02:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
one of them in particular and it's a
 
02:41:23.469 --> 02:41:23.479 align:start position:0%
large institutional
 
02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
owner and they said in those States they
 
02:41:29.550 --> 02:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
have seen problems and it's not just
 
02:41:32.309 --> 02:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
Hunters we have a very nice convenient
 
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
way to educate Hunters to the hunting
 
02:41:37.150 --> 02:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
digest but there are mountain bikers
 
02:41:39.469 --> 02:41:39.479 align:start position:0%
there are hikers there are a lot of this
 
02:41:41.990 --> 02:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
recreational Community is much broader
 
02:41:44.510 --> 02:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
than just hunting hunting's the easy
 
02:41:46.510 --> 02:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
group to educate
 
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
and Hunters generally respect PRI
 
02:41:50.349 --> 02:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
private property because they know
 
02:41:52.429 --> 02:41:52.439 align:start position:0%
they're a guest but there are other
 
02:41:55.349 --> 02:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
folks that just they don't we don't have
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
that conduit to educate them and so that
 
02:42:00.389 --> 02:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
was part of the the confusion that we
 
02:42:02.429 --> 02:42:02.439 align:start position:0%
they have seen first hand on their
 
02:42:04.510 --> 02:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
properties or their neighbors properties
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
in other states um and and again I think
 
02:42:13.389 --> 02:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
to really reiterate what Rob had said is
 
02:42:16.469 --> 02:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
as an organization we try to encourage
 
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
our members to open their land up to
 
02:42:22.550 --> 02:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
Recreation posting is a private property
 
02:42:26.269 --> 02:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
right we we certainly believe in that
 
02:42:27.950 --> 02:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that we really
 
02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
pride ourselves in is is opening op you
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
know encouraging members where they
 
02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
where they want to and feel it's
 
02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate to open their land up for
 
02:42:39.790 --> 02:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
for recreation whether it's hiking
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
hunting uh bird watching nature
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
observation skiing or or snowshoeing so
 
02:42:47.950 --> 02:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
again when we looked at this bill and
 
02:42:51.870 --> 02:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
our committee really wrestled with it um
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
we said at the end of the day the the
 
02:42:56.830 --> 02:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
the benefits that would be gleaned from
 
02:42:59.269 --> 02:42:59.279 align:start position:0%
a more quote convenient way of posting
 
02:43:01.150 --> 02:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't Merit some of the
 
02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
other problems that we felt we would see
 
02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
down the down the uh down the line more
 
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
or less and I should say in addition um
 
02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
it really kind of runs counter to one of
 
02:43:15.870 --> 02:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
the things that one of the 10 of our
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
organization and that we try to
 
02:43:20.469 --> 02:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
encourage Public Access and public use
 
02:43:22.349 --> 02:43:22.359 align:start position:0%
of private property where the landowner
 
02:43:23.389 --> 02:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
feels it's
 
02:43:25.750 --> 02:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate with that I'd be happy to
 
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions and uh again
 
02:43:31.389 --> 02:43:31.399 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your time to to testify
 
02:43:33.030 --> 02:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
02:43:36.510 --> 02:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
today thank you could you share if you
 
02:43:38.429 --> 02:43:38.439 align:start position:0%
if you have them with you some of the
 
02:43:40.269 --> 02:43:40.279 align:start position:0%
stories about what the problems that the
 
02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
others encountered in the other states
 
02:43:45.269 --> 02:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
exact I happy to thank you thank you
 
02:43:51.630 --> 02:43:51.640 align:start position:0%
chairman um so again folks that may not
 
02:43:54.750 --> 02:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
live in a state with purple posting go
 
02:43:58.269 --> 02:43:58.279 align:start position:0%
to hunt or travel to another state to
 
02:44:01.110 --> 02:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
hike they see these purple
 
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
blazes they don't have the benefit of a
 
02:44:06.110 --> 02:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
hunting digest if they're not a hunter
 
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
or if they live in a state where purple
 
02:44:11.550 --> 02:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
paint painting isn't a a
 
02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
practice they enter the property that
 
02:44:17.870 --> 02:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
may be posted with purple paint marks
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
not unknowingly and you create a
 
02:44:23.030 --> 02:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
situation where they accidentally enter
 
02:44:25.230 --> 02:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
into a property they're not being
 
02:44:28.349 --> 02:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
malicious they don't have ill intents
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
and now you have a you have this
 
02:44:32.710 --> 02:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
conflict conservation officer or a land
 
02:44:35.550 --> 02:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
owner hey you're posting and you kind of
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
create this negative environment whereas
 
02:44:39.389 --> 02:44:39.399 align:start position:0%
with a
 
02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
sign it's Crystal Clear and with a sign
 
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
you can State po posted you can get very
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
specific maybe it's Hunting Fishing
 
02:44:53.910 --> 02:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
whatever you can post again purple paint
 
02:44:58.710 --> 02:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
you don't really know more also it's not
 
02:45:02.670 --> 02:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
as universally recognized as a
 
02:45:06.030 --> 02:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
posting as as signage it just isn't and
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
that's where we've seen the uh we've
 
02:45:11.190 --> 02:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
seen it with our members when they see
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
they talk to their neighbors in other
 
02:45:15.150 --> 02:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
states they've said yeah we tried the
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:21.309 --> 02:45:21.319 align:start position:0%

question uh how do you square the
 
02:45:35.389 --> 02:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
difference between paint and Nails used
 
02:45:35.399 --> 02:45:37.750 align:start position:0%
difference between paint and Nails used
for

02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
signs well a couple things um and again
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
there are ways there are ways to post
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
without having to use Nails there are
 
02:45:49.550 --> 02:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
different types of Staples that can be
 
02:45:51.990 --> 02:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
used that aren't you know that aren't
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
roofing nails roofing nails are the
 
02:45:57.150 --> 02:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
Enemy Number One so there are ways to
 
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
use non roofing nail type or as we heard
 
02:46:03.429 --> 02:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
earlier uh drywall screw is even worse
 
02:46:08.349 --> 02:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
yet so there are ways to do it um and
 
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
you know the the other thing to remember
 
02:46:13.150 --> 02:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
is when you're when you have a property
 
02:46:15.150 --> 02:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
um generally you're going to post on on
 
02:46:18.190 --> 02:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
your property line you want to maintain
 
02:46:20.030 --> 02:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of those trees may also
 
02:46:22.510 --> 02:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
be trees that are border trees that
 
02:46:25.230 --> 02:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
design that that will be blazed with say
 
02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
a red red paint to designate your
 
02:46:29.750 --> 02:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
property line particularly if you're
 
02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
deep in a forest you're going to have
 
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
red blazes on it designating your
 
02:46:36.070 --> 02:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
property line you don't want to remove
 
02:46:38.830 --> 02:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
those trees even if you do a Timber sale
 
02:46:41.110 --> 02:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
in that neighborhood because that's that
 
02:46:43.630 --> 02:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
tells you and your neighbor where your
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
property line is so there's a a couple
 
02:46:47.710 --> 02:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
things a couple strategies and and a
 
02:46:50.510 --> 02:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
reason why you don't want to many times
 
02:46:52.150 --> 02:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
you may not want even want to remove
 
02:46:54.750 --> 02:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
that tree cuz that tells me and that
 
02:46:56.030 --> 02:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
tells my neighbor and that more
 
02:46:57.269 --> 02:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
importantly it tells my neighbor's
 
02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
logger hey those are my trees don't go
 
02:47:06.910 --> 02:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
line represent
 
02:47:12.190 --> 02:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you in in your testimony you
 
02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
said that your
 
02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
organization uh LED with the bill um can
 
02:47:19.309 --> 02:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
you tell me a little bit more about the
 
02:47:22.510 --> 02:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
kind of land owners you you represent
 
02:47:24.870 --> 02:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
just looking at your website uh it looks
 
02:47:28.750 --> 02:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
more like land owners who basically open
 
02:47:31.230 --> 02:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
up their their land for Timber
 
02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
harvesting as opposed to a person who
 
02:47:36.910 --> 02:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
might live in Dairy and might have 50
 
02:47:39.550 --> 02:47:39.560 align:start position:0%
acres or tell tell me a little bit more
 
02:47:41.910 --> 02:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
about your membership absolutely well
 
02:47:46.349 --> 02:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um our members we have our
 
02:47:50.950 --> 02:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
membership We have tree Farmers tree
 
02:47:53.590 --> 02:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
Farmers to be a tree farmer you have to
 
02:47:55.870 --> 02:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
have at least 10 acres so we'll have
 
02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
land owners we have members who are land
 
02:48:01.150 --> 02:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
owners that have 10 acres um some of
 
02:48:04.429 --> 02:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
them are in more Suburban areas like you
 
02:48:06.590 --> 02:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
know the regions of the state where it's
 
02:48:09.150 --> 02:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
a little more developed we also and that
 
02:48:10.870 --> 02:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
ranges all the way up to large
 
02:48:13.469 --> 02:48:13.479 align:start position:0%
institutional owners you know Timber
 
02:48:15.870 --> 02:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
investment groups Real Estate Investment
 
02:48:19.790 --> 02:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
Trust You know the large commercial
 
02:48:22.469 --> 02:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
organizations where they'll own tens
 
02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
tens or in some cases hundreds of
 
02:48:27.510 --> 02:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of Acres so our membership is
 
02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
is the is the entire range and and so
 
02:48:33.550 --> 02:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
our our me and then the other half of
 
02:48:36.150 --> 02:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
our members membership is businesses
 
02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
that are in the business of growing
 
02:48:41.630 --> 02:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
harvesting processing Forest Products
 
02:48:44.230 --> 02:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
and many of those companies also own
 
02:48:46.710 --> 02:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
Timberland because that's part of their
 
02:48:48.349 --> 02:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
business and that's part of their supply
 
02:48:52.670 --> 02:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
chain so the diversity of our membership
 
02:48:55.389 --> 02:48:55.399 align:start position:0%
generally unless you're a business or
 
02:48:58.670 --> 02:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
just love trees I would say most of our
 
02:49:02.990 --> 02:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
Members Own I would say in excess of 20
 
02:49:06.030 --> 02:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
acres um generally given that 10 acres
 
02:49:08.590 --> 02:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
is the threshold for say tree farm or
 
02:49:10.389 --> 02:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
current use
 
02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
status follow up
 
02:49:16.349 --> 02:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
please would you say that most of your
 
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
members actually live in New Hampshire
 
02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
or do quite a few of them live outside
 
02:49:23.030 --> 02:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
the state I would say on a on a
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
headcount basis most of them live in New
 
02:49:28.750 --> 02:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on a per acreage rate on a per
 
02:49:31.950 --> 02:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
acreage basis because you can have one
 
02:49:35.229 --> 02:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
large say a large parcel that's owned by
 
02:49:38.030 --> 02:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
a you know a outof state Real Estate
 
02:49:40.429 --> 02:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
Investment Trust they would say they
 
02:49:43.150 --> 02:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
would be out of state and so a lot of
 
02:49:45.670 --> 02:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
those little 20 acre tree farms
 
02:49:49.150 --> 02:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
it takes to equal 30,000 Acres up in
 
02:49:53.349 --> 02:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:58.830 --> 02:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
Dion

02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:39.670 --> 02:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon everyone thank you for
 
02:50:42.830 --> 02:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak um I have a a
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
different angle about this gu kind of uh
 
02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
I put my testimony on the back of um the
 
02:50:53.630 --> 02:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
tree sign this is um this is a plastic
 
02:50:54.990 --> 02:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
it's not paper it's not going to
 
02:50:57.870 --> 02:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
decompose so it adds to pollution in our
 
02:51:00.030 --> 02:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
forest especially how we're hearing how
 
02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's tearing them down and they
 
02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
get wethered and they fall down uh and
 
02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
animals have been seen chewing on this
 
02:51:11.510 --> 02:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
plastic and um you know ingesting
 
02:51:13.910 --> 02:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
plastic is can be fatal for the wild
 
02:51:16.190 --> 02:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
little wild animals out
 
02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
there um you can't tear this by the way
 
02:51:22.309 --> 02:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's um not paper so it will not
 
02:51:25.990 --> 02:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
decomposed so just for the
 
02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:27.550 align:start position:0%
decomposed so just for the
environmentally

02:51:27.550 --> 02:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
environmentally
 
02:51:30.590 --> 02:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
aware people that we are this is not a
 
02:51:34.269 --> 02:51:34.279 align:start position:0%
good um thing to put in a in a farus
 
02:51:38.030 --> 02:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
pain is much easier much better and
 
02:51:38.040 --> 02:51:39.670 align:start position:0%
pain is much easier much better and
um

02:51:39.670 --> 02:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:42.550 --> 02:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
um the gentleman just that was speaking
 
02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
he was talking about property lines and
 
02:51:47.110 --> 02:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
he said they're painted with red paint
 
02:51:49.590 --> 02:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
why don't they have a sign you know why
 
02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
are all these Trails marked with paint
 
02:51:55.950 --> 02:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
it's because paint works well it's easy
 
02:52:00.030 --> 02:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
to um put on trees or whatever so and
 
02:52:02.349 --> 02:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
it's easy to understand if you if you're
 
02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
a hiker you know what the different
 
02:52:05.590 --> 02:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
colors mean if you're a hunter you're
 
02:52:11.389 --> 02:52:11.399 align:start position:0%
going to know that purple means stay out
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
um I and I I think it's I I don't think
 
02:52:17.910 --> 02:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
you give um people enough credit that
 
02:52:19.389 --> 02:52:19.399 align:start position:0%
they're not going to know what these
 
02:52:22.110 --> 02:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
purple stripes mean they're um you know
 
02:52:23.790 --> 02:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to be I don't know what is it
 
02:52:26.110 --> 02:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
12 Ines I I don't have the bill but
 
02:52:28.910 --> 02:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
people going are going to know what that
 
02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:31.830 align:start position:0%
people going are going to know what that
means

02:52:31.830 --> 02:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:52:35.229 --> 02:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
um uh we're not stupid we we can figure
 
02:52:38.469 --> 02:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
it out you know and uh I guess that's
 
02:52:42.070 --> 02:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
all I have really you know because um
 
02:52:44.229 --> 02:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
representative Reed gave good testimony
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:50.830 --> 02:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
everything thank you representative
 
02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
Jamber I have a question I do Mr
 
02:52:54.349 --> 02:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you and thank you for
 
02:52:55.670 --> 02:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you for coming
 
02:52:58.710 --> 02:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
today um one of the things that your
 
02:53:03.550 --> 02:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
sign here actually peaked in my mind was
 
02:53:07.550 --> 02:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
purple paint does it mean no hunting no
 
02:53:10.710 --> 02:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
trespassing no trespassing no trapping
 
02:53:13.630 --> 02:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
no dogs I mean this sign actually
 
02:53:16.710 --> 02:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
discerns many things whereas purple
 
02:53:18.830 --> 02:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
paint is just a general provision not to
 
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
trespass or is it to no hunt
 
02:53:24.950 --> 02:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
because it's it's confusing to me can
 
02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
you just speak on that well it's um no
 
02:53:30.710 --> 02:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a no hunting you know a lot of
 
02:53:32.630 --> 02:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
people think this bill is an
 
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
anti-hunting bill it's not it's a
 
02:53:37.990 --> 02:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
property Rights bill
 
02:53:41.670 --> 02:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
um and it it means no trespassing simple
 
02:53:43.950 --> 02:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
as that um like this sign says no
 
02:53:45.990 --> 02:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
trapping you you can't trap anyway on
 
02:53:47.630 --> 02:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
people's property without
 
02:53:50.469 --> 02:53:50.479 align:start position:0%
permission um because it's so violent
 
02:53:54.469 --> 02:53:54.479 align:start position:0%
and cruel and so um I probably shouldn't
 
02:53:57.910 --> 02:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
said that but anyway yeah it's no
 
02:54:01.590 --> 02:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
trespassing I know somebody who wants to
 
02:54:04.190 --> 02:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
stop people hunters from her property so
 
02:54:05.630 --> 02:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
she says she's not she's going to
 
02:54:07.870 --> 02:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
continue to use the signs anyway because
 
02:54:10.910 --> 02:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
she's going to say hikers allowed on her
 
02:54:12.670 --> 02:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
signs so that's the thing you have the

02:54:36.229 --> 02:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
could go fishing or you could go hiking
 
02:54:38.110 --> 02:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
but you can't
 
02:54:40.990 --> 02:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
hunt uh yes there a sign for pretty much
 
02:54:43.469 --> 02:54:43.479 align:start position:0%
anything fishing game even gives out
 
02:54:46.269 --> 02:54:46.279 align:start position:0%
signs Hunters
 
02:54:48.429 --> 02:54:48.439 align:start position:0%
welcome things like that so there are
 
02:54:50.269 --> 02:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
different types of signs this is the
 
02:54:52.510 --> 02:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
most widely used because it's most
 
02:54:56.429 --> 02:54:56.439 align:start position:0%
affordable got it thank you
 
02:55:01.469 --> 02:55:01.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
testimony um the chair calls The
 
02:55:08.670 --> 02:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:10.790 --> 02:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:55:13.309 --> 02:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
committee mine's uh real quick so uh I
 
02:55:15.510 --> 02:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
support this bill because I I don't want
 
02:55:17.870 --> 02:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh Hunters to get harmed uh for example
 
02:55:19.790 --> 02:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
if they were to trespass on my property
 
02:55:21.269 --> 02:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't end well if I see an
 
02:55:22.830 --> 02:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
individual lurking around my property
 
02:55:24.750 --> 02:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
that's armed it will not end well I will
 
02:55:26.229 --> 02:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
assume it is a federal agent trying to
 
02:55:30.510 --> 02:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:33.870 --> 02:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:37.190 --> 02:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
you chair calls uh the representative
 
02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:43.190 align:start position:0%
you chair calls uh the representative
Kelly

02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:48.550 --> 02:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:51.150 --> 02:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
right so again for the record uh
 
02:55:52.870 --> 02:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Penza Strafford
 
02:55:57.190 --> 02:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
District 19 um I was here so I heard
 
02:55:59.429 --> 02:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
this bill and I stayed and um just
 
02:56:00.830 --> 02:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
because I wanted to speak on it real
 
02:56:03.070 --> 02:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
quick so I think that the the most
 
02:56:05.790 --> 02:56:05.800 align:start position:0%
important thing in this whole discussion
 
02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
is who has rights to my property I do um
 
02:56:11.910 --> 02:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
this is really a liberty issue more than
 
02:56:13.710 --> 02:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
anything else and it gives people
 
02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:15.110 align:start position:0%
anything else and it gives people
options

02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
options
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
so I love the other the previous speaker
 
02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
that said she wants a sign that's
 
02:56:22.830 --> 02:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
basically going to say hikers and and
 
02:56:26.030 --> 02:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
you know um hikers and if somebody wants
 
02:56:28.349 --> 02:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
to ride their horse or whatever but she
 
02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't want you know hunters and I
 
02:56:32.990 --> 02:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
actually have a personal story my very
 
02:56:37.309 --> 02:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
good friend um she owns 66 acres in
 
02:56:40.830 --> 02:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
straford county and has had multiple
 
02:56:43.790 --> 02:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
problems with her property she wants to
 
02:56:46.269 --> 02:56:46.279 align:start position:0%
actually build a couple different homes
 
02:56:48.790 --> 02:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
and have it be um where she where she
 
02:56:50.990 --> 02:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
sets up she actually has her house right
 
02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
now is in Lee she has had so many
 
02:56:57.830 --> 02:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
problems with her property um not just
 
02:57:01.389 --> 02:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
about the sign piece but uh they have
 
02:57:03.950 --> 02:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
gone missing that is an issue but her
 
02:57:06.990 --> 02:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
game cameras have gone missing um she Lo
 
02:57:09.630 --> 02:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
she has her her cameras on there because
 
02:57:12.190 --> 02:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
she loves to see the wildlife um you
 
02:57:13.710 --> 02:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
know she gets a little notice and she
 
02:57:15.790 --> 02:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
sees the deer and she sees the bear she
 
02:57:19.469 --> 02:57:19.479 align:start position:0%
sees bears and uh um Bobcats and it's
 
02:57:21.870 --> 02:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
it's fantastic but she's lost her game
 
02:57:26.389 --> 02:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
cameras and she has a gentleman that um
 
02:57:29.550 --> 02:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
you know he just continues to um go
 
02:57:33.269 --> 02:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
through her property over and over um
 
02:57:36.269 --> 02:57:36.279 align:start position:0%
you know and she doesn't even know how
 
02:57:39.990 --> 02:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
at this point um to get him out so I
 
02:57:41.870 --> 02:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
just think this would be an easier thing
 
02:57:44.349 --> 02:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
she actually hurt her ankle I remember
 
02:57:46.469 --> 02:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
her telling me that she when the signs
 
02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
were gone um that's a that's a real if
 
02:57:51.990 --> 02:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
you can make life easier for people and
 
02:57:55.269 --> 02:57:55.279 align:start position:0%
put paint um and I think it's great I do
 
02:57:56.630 --> 02:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
think that there's an environmental
 
02:57:58.790 --> 02:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
thing plastic signs kind of stink I know
 
02:58:00.550 --> 02:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
this uh I hated buying them when I was
 
02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
running for election um but that's the
 
02:58:04.870 --> 02:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
only way the paper ones really just fall
 
02:58:07.630 --> 02:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
apart uh in weather and so I just think
 
02:58:09.910 --> 02:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a a great Liberty issue
 
02:58:12.469 --> 02:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
property right issue Bill and uh there
 
02:58:14.349 --> 02:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
should be options for anyone people
 
02:58:16.590 --> 02:58:16.600 align:start position:0%
still want to have signs they should as
 
02:58:19.349 --> 02:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
well as if it was my property I sh I
 
02:58:20.670 --> 02:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
would not want to put my name and
 
02:58:23.309 --> 02:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
address on something as well I think
 
02:58:26.429 --> 02:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
it's also a privacy issue um so I think
 
02:58:28.309 --> 02:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
this can alleviate a lot of things let's
 
02:58:31.150 --> 02:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:34.229 --> 02:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
options thank you for your
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair calls major Dave
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:54.190 align:start position:0%
 
game

02:58:54.190 --> 02:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:55.710 --> 02:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Roy members of
 
02:58:57.070 --> 02:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Dave Walsh I'm
 
02:58:58.349 --> 02:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
the assistant chief of law enforcement
 
02:59:00.229 --> 02:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire fishing game fishing
 
02:59:01.790 --> 02:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
game department has taken the position
 
02:59:04.910 --> 02:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill you've heard from
 
02:59:07.030 --> 02:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
the Timberland Owners Association and
 
02:59:08.630 --> 02:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
the Farm Bureau so I won't reiterate a
 
02:59:11.190 --> 02:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
lot of their comments I will say this um
 
02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
for 40 years this prescribed manner of
 
02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
posting statute has been in existence I
 
02:59:17.150 --> 02:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
think everybody here recognizes and
 
02:59:18.750 --> 02:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
probably sees daily on their commute the
 
02:59:20.750 --> 02:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
orange posted signs everybody knows what
 
02:59:23.469 --> 02:59:23.479 align:start position:0%
they mean if we allow the purple paint
 
02:59:25.550 --> 02:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
it certainly will bring confusion I also
 
02:59:27.269 --> 02:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
reached out to the state of Maine who in
 
02:59:30.870 --> 02:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
2011 instituted a very similar bill and
 
02:59:33.389 --> 02:59:33.399 align:start position:0%
I was told that it is not unusual for
 
02:59:35.510 --> 02:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
hunters and non Hunter non-hunters alike
 
02:59:38.349 --> 02:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
from out of state to be found they avoid
 
02:59:41.590 --> 02:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
the posted pieces the posted signs and
 
02:59:43.510 --> 02:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
end up on property with purple paint
 
02:59:44.750 --> 02:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
thinking they're doing the right thing
 
02:59:46.309 --> 02:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
because they just simply don't know the
 
02:59:48.790 --> 02:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
difference um and to representative PR
 
02:59:51.389 --> 02:59:51.399 align:start position:0%
point we do have a a method of of
 
02:59:52.790 --> 02:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
notifying our Hunters with the hunting
 
02:59:54.670 --> 02:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
digest although I can tell you after 26
 
02:59:57.349 --> 02:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
years they don't always read them but
 
02:59:59.150 --> 02:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
hikers and every other outdoor
 
03:00:01.550 --> 03:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
Enthusiast there's not an easy way to
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
get that word out um another scenario
 
03:00:06.349 --> 03:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
that I've dealt with dozens of times
 
03:00:08.630 --> 03:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
over my career is you'll have a hunter
 
03:00:10.510 --> 03:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
outout on legal land they'll shoot a
 
03:00:12.309 --> 03:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
deer for example they'll track the
 
03:00:14.070 --> 03:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
wounded deer to post the property that
 
03:00:15.630 --> 03:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
Hunter does not have the right to enter
 
03:00:17.309 --> 03:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
poost of property to dispatch that
 
03:00:18.950 --> 03:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
wounded animal they have to contact the
 
03:00:21.030 --> 03:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
land owner and get permission if the
 
03:00:23.190 --> 03:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
signs they know exactly who to contact
 
03:00:25.830 --> 03:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's this purple paint that delays what
 
03:00:28.429 --> 03:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
is a timely issue and finally I think
 
03:00:30.309 --> 03:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
the most important piece of why this
 
03:00:33.750 --> 03:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
should not be passed is if you allow
 
03:00:35.710 --> 03:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
land owners to post their land with no
 
03:00:38.150 --> 03:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
contact information at all it distances
 
03:00:39.870 --> 03:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
the communication or discourages the
 
03:00:41.389 --> 03:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
communication between the outdoor
 
03:00:43.990 --> 03:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
enthusiasts and the land owners New
 
03:00:45.870 --> 03:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a long and proud history
 
03:00:48.309 --> 03:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
of outdoor recreation 80% of our
 
03:00:50.630 --> 03:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
property in the state is private land if
 
03:00:52.429 --> 03:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
you discourage communication I can't
 
03:00:54.070 --> 03:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
think of any scenario in life where
 
03:00:55.990 --> 03:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
discouraging communication works it's
 
03:00:58.469 --> 03:00:58.479 align:start position:0%
going to create more posted property and
 
03:01:00.830 --> 03:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
we all anyone who enjoys the outdoors is
 
03:01:02.990 --> 03:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to lose out if we add more posted
 
03:01:07.550 --> 03:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:11.429 --> 03:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
state thank you representative Manion
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:01:14.750 --> 03:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so the criminal
 
03:01:18.070 --> 03:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
statute says knowingly or a person
 
03:01:20.110 --> 03:01:20.120 align:start position:0%
knowingly trespasses on the property do
 
03:01:21.550 --> 03:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
you think that this would pose a problem
 
03:01:24.309 --> 03:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
in prosecution of anybody absolutely and
 
03:01:26.429 --> 03:01:26.439 align:start position:0%
you know Maine put the law in in 2011 in
 
03:01:28.190 --> 03:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
the steel dealing with problems 12 years
 
03:01:30.670 --> 03:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
after so to prove that somebody knew
 
03:01:33.070 --> 03:01:33.080 align:start position:0%
what purple pain is as opposed to uh a
 
03:01:38.630 --> 03:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.429 --> 03:01:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:46.510 --> 03:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
Muse is as a property owner shouldn't a
 
03:01:49.550 --> 03:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
decision about communication be one that
 
03:01:52.030 --> 03:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
the property owner uh is entitled to
 
03:01:55.349 --> 03:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
make so if I decide that I want to have
 
03:01:57.950 --> 03:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
no communication with somebody who wants
 
03:02:01.190 --> 03:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
to come on my land what what's the issue
 
03:02:04.710 --> 03:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
with that I'm not sure I understand well
 
03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you know we have a very
 
03:02:08.990 --> 03:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
proud history of outdoor recreation not
 
03:02:10.830 --> 03:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
just hunting and fishing but snowshoeing
 
03:02:13.309 --> 03:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
hiking bird watching all those things if
 
03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
you don't if the land owners which 80%
 
03:02:17.150 --> 03:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
of our land is private if the land
 
03:02:18.429 --> 03:02:18.439 align:start position:0%
owners don't want to communicate with
 
03:02:20.670 --> 03:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
the people that access all the property
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
then we diminish those outdoor
 
03:02:24.269 --> 03:02:24.279 align:start position:0%
recreational Pursuits and I don't think
 
03:02:28.830 --> 03:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
that's the answer way followup
 
03:02:31.830 --> 03:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
followup isn't that a de facto mandate
 
03:02:35.550 --> 03:02:35.560 align:start position:0%
though for commun for land owners to be
 
03:02:37.990 --> 03:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
required or be forced to communicate
 
03:02:39.750 --> 03:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
with these
 
03:02:42.429 --> 03:02:42.439 align:start position:0%
folks well it's working for 40 years I
 
03:02:43.590 --> 03:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to call it a def
 
03:02:47.030 --> 03:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:50.550 --> 03:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
but could you uh you say 40 years has
 
03:02:53.550 --> 03:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire always had a shared land
 
03:02:57.710 --> 03:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
own land use policy um even before that
 
03:02:59.070 --> 03:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
since way back in the beginning it was
 
03:03:01.510 --> 03:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding that when this state
 
03:03:03.870 --> 03:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
was founded they people had come from
 
03:03:06.070 --> 03:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
England where you had to be a lord or
 
03:03:07.630 --> 03:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
the king's permission to hunt on the
 
03:03:09.229 --> 03:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
king's land and you could actually be
 
03:03:11.269 --> 03:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
executed for killing one of the king's
 
03:03:13.630 --> 03:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
deer so they were very open to the fact
 
03:03:15.870 --> 03:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
that keeping just land for everyone and
 
03:03:18.510 --> 03:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
not just the the rich titled people is
 
03:03:20.229 --> 03:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
is that where it came from that's
 
03:03:22.110 --> 03:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
exactly right yeah and I I believe these
 
03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
statutes are you know came in existence
 
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
roughly 40 50 years ago but that is that
 
03:03:27.510 --> 03:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
is how it was all founded correct is
 
03:03:29.950 --> 03:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
that anybody whether you're rich poor
 
03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
could access the land y thank you
 
03:03:35.469 --> 03:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
representative jamron thank you Mr
 
03:03:37.790 --> 03:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
chairman um a lot of the folks on this
 
03:03:39.469 --> 03:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
committee don't deal with fishing game
 
03:03:42.389 --> 03:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
very often I understand that you have um
 
03:03:44.510 --> 03:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
a program where you assist people in
 
03:03:46.790 --> 03:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
posting their property secondarily to
 
03:03:50.030 --> 03:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
that if a person buys a piece of
 
03:03:51.710 --> 03:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
property that's has been posted by the
 
03:03:53.950 --> 03:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
prior owner what is the process for them
 
03:03:57.309 --> 03:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
to uh to unpost that with purple paint
 
03:03:58.870 --> 03:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
it seems it would be honorous to go out
 
03:04:02.910 --> 03:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
and paint over or or demaret that but
 
03:04:04.429 --> 03:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
would it would it not be easier to
 
03:04:07.269 --> 03:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
remove a sign correctly yeah so we do
 
03:04:08.710 --> 03:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
have a landowner relations program that
 
03:04:10.750 --> 03:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
we do help land owners but yes if if I
 
03:04:12.830 --> 03:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
bought 20 acres that somebody had posted
 
03:04:14.349 --> 03:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
before me and I don't want to post it I
 
03:04:16.229 --> 03:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
would have to remove all those signs or
 
03:04:18.269 --> 03:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
in the if there's paint I'd have to
 
03:04:19.830 --> 03:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
either paint over them or scrape them
 
03:04:21.389 --> 03:04:21.399 align:start position:0%
down or do something I have to find them
 
03:04:24.950 --> 03:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:28.590 --> 03:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative seig thank you just a
 
03:04:30.150 --> 03:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
very quick question and thank you for
 
03:04:33.510 --> 03:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so I understand
 
03:04:35.990 --> 03:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
you opposed the spill would for people
 
03:04:38.510 --> 03:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
who post their signs and regularly have
 
03:04:41.150 --> 03:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
them torn down by people who shouldn't
 
03:04:43.630 --> 03:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
be tearing them down um we would you
 
03:04:46.590 --> 03:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
support elevating the penalty for doing
 
03:04:48.830 --> 03:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
that sure the penalty if somebody's
 
03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
caught removing a def facing a sign yeah
 
03:04:54.030 --> 03:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it currently is a misdemeanor um
 
03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'd be very surprised if the state of
 
03:04:57.510 --> 03:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire made it higher than that
 
03:05:00.190 --> 03:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
but uh I I'm I'm happy that it is a
 
03:05:00.200 --> 03:05:02.110 align:start position:0%
but uh I I'm I'm happy that it is a
misdemeanor

03:05:02.110 --> 03:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
03:05:05.870 --> 03:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:08.750 --> 03:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you for taking my
 
03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
question what's the legal status of
 
03:05:13.670 --> 03:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
somebody that the sign is posted but
 
03:05:16.590 --> 03:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
there's no owner information on it good
 
03:05:19.510 --> 03:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
question yep so the criminal trespass
 
03:05:21.070 --> 03:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
statute we have a prescribed manner of
 
03:05:23.510 --> 03:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
posting statute which recommends the 2
 
03:05:25.990 --> 03:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
in block letters every 100 yards but the
 
03:05:28.229 --> 03:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
criminal trespass statute says if it's
 
03:05:29.630 --> 03:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
posted in the manner that Comer
 
03:05:31.550 --> 03:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
attention is considered Post-it so our
 
03:05:32.790 --> 03:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
job in law enforcement we would have to
 
03:05:34.950 --> 03:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
prove that it came to their attention um
 
03:05:38.070 --> 03:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
I can give you many many scenarios where
 
03:05:39.389 --> 03:05:39.399 align:start position:0%
I'll get a call that is Hunters on
 
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
posted property or someone's on posted
 
03:05:42.269 --> 03:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
property I find them and they say well
 
03:05:44.229 --> 03:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
they didn't know it was posted if I step
 
03:05:45.710 --> 03:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
back four or five feet I can see the
 
03:05:48.950 --> 03:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
blaze arm sign 100 yards away if I can
 
03:05:50.870 --> 03:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
see it they can see it that wouldn't be
 
03:05:52.830 --> 03:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
the case with purple paint
 
03:05:56.229 --> 03:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
but to be clear does it have to have the
 
03:05:58.269 --> 03:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
landowner's name and information on it
 
03:06:00.309 --> 03:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
to be considered properly posted to
 
03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
violate the
 
03:06:04.630 --> 03:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
law properly posted it does however you
 
03:06:06.670 --> 03:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
can still prove Criminal Trespass if you
 
03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
can prove that they knew they were not
 
03:06:11.550 --> 03:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to be there okay so a signed it
 
03:06:13.670 --> 03:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
just says no trespassing cons still
 
03:06:15.550 --> 03:06:15.560 align:start position:0%
prove Criminal Trespass even if there's
 
03:06:17.670 --> 03:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
no landowner information correct thank
 
03:06:20.550 --> 03:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
you um who
 
03:06:23.309 --> 03:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
else okay that's it thank you for oh I
 
03:06:25.710 --> 03:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
have one last question I have about I
 
03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
think almost 10 acres and it's got blue
 
03:06:30.750 --> 03:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
paint all the way around it and I was
 
03:06:32.269 --> 03:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
walking my dogs the other day and I kind
 
03:06:33.670 --> 03:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
of noticed some of them were fading and
 
03:06:35.630 --> 03:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
looking a little purple what does the
 
03:06:36.990 --> 03:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
blue paint
 
03:06:41.429 --> 03:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
signify I have no idea it I I think
 
03:06:42.790 --> 03:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
because I'm surrounded by Bear Brook
 
03:06:45.349 --> 03:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
State Park Park that it might indicate
 
03:06:47.550 --> 03:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
state property but you don't know uh so
 
03:06:49.389 --> 03:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
every so the fishing game department our
 
03:06:51.150 --> 03:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
property we Blaze with orange blaze
 
03:06:54.229 --> 03:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
orange uh so if another agency uses blue
 
03:06:55.229 --> 03:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of it but it could it
 
03:06:56.710 --> 03:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
could be state parks although I've not
 
03:06:59.870 --> 03:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
dealt with blue paint okay yeah all
 
03:07:02.429 --> 03:07:02.439 align:start position:0%
right maybe it was purple I don't
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
know yeah could be all right no further
 
03:07:07.030 --> 03:07:07.040 align:start position:0%

03:51:29.030 --> 03:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
1566 would you like to speak to your
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chairman I would uh 156 uh
 
03:51:34.910 --> 03:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
attempts to address issues that are
 
03:51:37.750 --> 03:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
currently already being addressed in the
 
03:51:39.510 --> 03:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and it sounded
 
03:51:41.630 --> 03:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
during the uh testimony from everyone
 
03:51:43.269 --> 03:51:43.279 align:start position:0%
here this morning that it's really more
 
03:51:44.990 --> 03:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
of a localized issue versus a state
 
03:51:47.110 --> 03:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
issue there are many Avenues to address
 
03:51:49.950 --> 03:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
any perceived uh uh improprieties with
 
03:51:52.110 --> 03:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
either police conduct or police
 
03:51:53.950 --> 03:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
investigations and some of those were
 
03:51:56.750 --> 03:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
testified to today in addition uh there
 
03:51:59.189 --> 03:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
is the option of an agency requesting an
 
03:52:01.309 --> 03:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
independent review from a private vendor
 
03:52:03.389 --> 03:52:03.399 align:start position:0%
such as uh Municipal resources or a
 
03:52:05.309 --> 03:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
similar group that would come in and
 
03:52:07.710 --> 03:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
basically go through and assess the any
 
03:52:09.510 --> 03:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
needs that need to be changed for an
 
03:52:09.520 --> 03:52:11.309 align:start position:0%
needs that need to be changed for an
individual

03:52:11.309 --> 03:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:52:13.030 --> 03:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
Department would you like to speak to
 
03:52:15.269 --> 03:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
your second representative Pro yes I
 
03:52:15.279 --> 03:52:20.229 align:start position:0%
your second representative Pro yes I
would

03:52:20.229 --> 03:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:23.790 --> 03:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh I thought I had left it on uh it
 
03:52:26.910 --> 03:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
seemed like uh some things fell through
 
03:52:29.469 --> 03:52:29.479 align:start position:0%
the cracks that usually don't in this
 
03:52:32.790 --> 03:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
case uh and I'm think
 
03:52:35.990 --> 03:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
that the family has brought awareness to
 
03:52:40.110 --> 03:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
that department of the uh
 
03:52:40.120 --> 03:52:42.030 align:start position:0%
that department of the uh
inefficiencies

03:52:42.030 --> 03:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies
 
03:52:45.149 --> 03:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
um and I have heard that
 
03:52:49.750 --> 03:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
um towards the end uh actually the
 
03:52:51.510 --> 03:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
police department and the family got to
 
03:52:53.750 --> 03:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
sit down and discuss all these things
 
03:52:53.760 --> 03:52:55.269 align:start position:0%
sit down and discuss all these things
and

03:52:55.269 --> 03:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:57.950 --> 03:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
um they were made aware of a lot more
 
03:52:59.349 --> 03:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
information than they did in the
 
03:53:00.910 --> 03:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
beginning when things fell through the
 
03:53:04.910 --> 03:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
crack so as it came full circle I think
 
03:53:06.590 --> 03:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
they got there it just took them a long
 
03:53:09.910 --> 03:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
and hard way to get there thank you f
 
03:53:09.920 --> 03:53:10.670 align:start position:0%
and hard way to get there thank you f
the

03:53:10.670 --> 03:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:53:13.349 --> 03:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
discussion represent wheeler thank you
 
03:53:16.030 --> 03:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh I'm going to be voting
 
03:53:18.830 --> 03:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
against the itl motion I believe that an
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
amendment could be made which makes this
 
03:53:24.110 --> 03:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
legislation workable I believe that the
 
03:53:26.670 --> 03:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
idea brought forward of increased
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
accountability and transparency in
 
03:53:31.110 --> 03:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
government is is a good thing and I and
 
03:53:33.389 --> 03:53:33.399 align:start position:0%
I think it's sad to hear that the people
 
03:53:35.590 --> 03:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
of dairy have such a distrust for their
 
03:53:40.630 --> 03:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
Police Department uh knowing the uh uh
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
standards that New Hampshire Police Hold
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
themselves to so I think it's a good
 
03:53:46.469 --> 03:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
thing to have accountability and
 
03:53:49.389 --> 03:53:49.399 align:start position:0%
transparency and to push for uh
 
03:53:51.229 --> 03:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
investigations that are are done in a
 
03:53:55.149 --> 03:53:55.159 align:start position:0%
thorough Manner and uh I'm going to vote
 
03:53:57.149 --> 03:53:57.159 align:start position:0%
against the itl on principle for that
 
03:54:00.309 --> 03:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
family that uh told a very impactful
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
story about the lack of transparency in
 
03:54:06.149 --> 03:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
in in the situation that they had and uh
 
03:54:09.389 --> 03:54:09.399 align:start position:0%
vote against the itl motion for
 
03:54:12.550 --> 03:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh in the hopes that someone sees this
 
03:54:14.070 --> 03:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
and and writes up an amendment to make
 
03:54:15.910 --> 03:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:54:18.550 --> 03:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
better thank you I would just respond by
 
03:54:22.110 --> 03:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
saying I it it in my mind it's a there's
 
03:54:25.389 --> 03:54:25.399 align:start position:0%
a needed for some ethics guidelines
 
03:54:27.469 --> 03:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps I just don't think that we have
 
03:54:30.670 --> 03:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
the time left to give it the due um
 
03:54:33.070 --> 03:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
diligence that it needs with regard to
 
03:54:36.269 --> 03:54:36.279 align:start position:0%
maybe perhaps investigations
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
occurring or being referred out before
 
03:54:41.349 --> 03:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
for an investigation this concept of
 
03:54:43.830 --> 03:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
secondary investigations as we heard
 
03:54:45.790 --> 03:54:45.800 align:start position:0%
from the testimony could cause a lot of
 
03:54:48.030 --> 03:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
problems with Witnesses having different
 
03:54:50.429 --> 03:54:50.439 align:start position:0%
testimonies um it it could cause more
 
03:54:51.870 --> 03:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
problems than it's worth that's why the
 
03:54:53.349 --> 03:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office wasn't in
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
favor of it and any way shape or form in
 
03:54:59.149 --> 03:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
its current form so um but I I your
 
03:55:02.910 --> 03:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
point is well taken um representative um
 
03:55:06.550 --> 03:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um I I do
 
03:55:08.070 --> 03:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
understand the constraints that we have
 
03:55:10.269 --> 03:55:10.279 align:start position:0%
on time and the committee and that the
 
03:55:12.389 --> 03:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
bill had some issues in its current form
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
but I just find it impossible to vote
 
03:55:17.429 --> 03:55:17.439 align:start position:0%
itl after hearing um from this family
 
03:55:21.030 --> 03:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
and understanding that it must be an
 
03:55:23.070 --> 03:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
unspeakable burden to have to
 
03:55:25.790 --> 03:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
simultaneously plan funeral arrangements
 
03:55:28.110 --> 03:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
for your loved one and be going through
 
03:55:30.510 --> 03:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
this process to try and find Justice
 
03:55:32.070 --> 03:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
through the system and that there has to
 
03:55:34.389 --> 03:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
be something we can do to make that
 
03:55:36.870 --> 03:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
process easier for the
 
03:55:39.309 --> 03:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
people thank you
 
03:55:43.429 --> 03:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
representative s thank you I I am um
 
03:55:44.910 --> 03:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
like representative Murray and and
 
03:55:46.910 --> 03:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler I I agreed
 
03:55:48.309 --> 03:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
there's some problems with the bill and
 
03:55:50.750 --> 03:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
but I I can't support itl I think it
 
03:55:52.870 --> 03:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
should be amended and would prefer if we
 
03:55:55.110 --> 03:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
had sufficient time even till Monday
 
03:55:58.349 --> 03:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:02.750 --> 03:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
that well let me ask this do you think
 
03:56:04.750 --> 03:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
if I were to recess the executive
 
03:56:06.670 --> 03:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
session you would be able to get an
 
03:56:08.469 --> 03:56:08.479 align:start position:0%
amendment that you think that you could
 
03:56:10.309 --> 03:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
gu under the support of the majority of
 
03:56:10.319 --> 03:56:12.349 align:start position:0%
gu under the support of the majority of
this

03:56:12.349 --> 03:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:56:14.630 --> 03:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee I I wonder if we could do an
 
03:56:14.640 --> 03:56:16.229 align:start position:0%
committee I I wonder if we could do an
amendment

03:56:16.229 --> 03:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:56:18.550 --> 03:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
that my understanding of part of the
 
03:56:21.510 --> 03:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
problem was the from from the testimony
 
03:56:23.670 --> 03:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
we heard today specifically part of it
 
03:56:25.269 --> 03:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
had to do with perceived conflict of
 
03:56:28.189 --> 03:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
interest based on someone having a role
 
03:56:30.510 --> 03:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
within the town I think if there were an
 
03:56:30.520 --> 03:56:32.670 align:start position:0%
within the town I think if there were an
amendment

03:56:32.670 --> 03:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:56:36.349 --> 03:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
that that included if someone works for
 
03:56:39.950 --> 03:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
the town or has a a I don't exactly know
 
03:56:41.389 --> 03:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
the words my head's a little foggy at
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
the moment in full honesty because I
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
have a migraine um but some language
 
03:56:49.750 --> 03:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
around if there's a um the person works
 
03:56:51.950 --> 03:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
for the town or um something to do with
 
03:56:54.149 --> 03:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
the fat fatality element that we could
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
probably work something that we would
 
03:56:57.830 --> 03:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
all be comfortable with or at least
 
03:56:59.630 --> 03:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
reasonably equally uncomfortable but
 
03:57:01.950 --> 03:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable if that makes sense we we
 
03:57:04.389 --> 03:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
thought about that ourselves and we the
 
03:57:06.269 --> 03:57:06.279 align:start position:0%
problem we ran into is you start looking
 
03:57:10.189 --> 03:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
at some municipalities is is it just the
 
03:57:12.670 --> 03:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
town Does it include the school Does it
 
03:57:15.269 --> 03:57:15.279 align:start position:0%
include in this case it wouldn't helped
 
03:57:16.710 --> 03:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
because that was a state employee
 
03:57:18.670 --> 03:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
because it was a social worker not
 
03:57:21.670 --> 03:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
someone who worked for the town so how
 
03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
it becomes so enormous that you start it
 
03:57:27.990 --> 03:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
becomes unwieldy and unworkable I I
 
03:57:29.349 --> 03:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
again I don't have the words right now
 
03:57:30.229 --> 03:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's why I said I don't think we have
 
03:57:32.750 --> 03:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
the time to really sort out right but it
 
03:57:35.070 --> 03:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
so so where where I'm coming from is is
 
03:57:37.550 --> 03:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
I agree that this bill the language as
 
03:57:39.429 --> 03:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
it's currently written
 
03:57:40.950 --> 03:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
and as we heard testimony it sounds like
 
03:57:42.309 --> 03:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
it wasn't even written to fall under the
 
03:57:47.590 --> 03:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
correct section yeah um so but I I'm
 
03:57:49.149 --> 03:57:49.159 align:start position:0%
voting against it because I wish we had
 
03:57:50.950 --> 03:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
the time to do the work necessary does
 
03:57:54.550 --> 03:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
that make sense it does I mean if if I
 
03:57:56.630 --> 03:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
could get a unanimous agreement I'd be
 
03:57:59.710 --> 03:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
happy to send it to interim study um
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
which keeps it quasy alive to work on
 
03:58:05.670 --> 03:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
without sending the message that I I
 
03:58:08.110 --> 03:58:08.120 align:start position:0%
would support that and as as you know
 
03:58:10.030 --> 03:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
living in a Community where I know the
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
level of extra stuff they go through I I
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate that con can I get kind of a
 
03:58:17.149 --> 03:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
show hands who would support an interim
 
03:58:20.110 --> 03:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
study I withdraw my motion do you
 
03:58:21.950 --> 03:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
withdraw your motion to it or who made
 
03:58:23.790 --> 03:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
the itl stone do you were you willing to
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
withdraw your itl to do intern
 
03:58:28.710 --> 03:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
study can I if that's a popular
 
03:58:29.870 --> 03:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
consensus of the
 
03:58:31.590 --> 03:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
committee go
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
ahead Mr chairman one of the things I
 
03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
would like to say is
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
I I think right now we're all making a
 
03:58:39.590 --> 03:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
decision based based on emotions because
 
03:58:43.550 --> 03:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
we heard a very god- awful story
 
03:58:46.790 --> 03:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that the bill that is
 
03:58:50.510 --> 03:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
presented to us is was going to change
 
03:58:52.790 --> 03:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
the outcome of that and if this is a
 
03:58:52.800 --> 03:58:54.469 align:start position:0%
the outcome of that and if this is a
situation

03:58:54.469 --> 03:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:58:57.229 --> 03:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
of of where the guide RS have to be for
 
03:58:58.870 --> 03:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest that wasn't the
 
03:59:01.110 --> 03:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
bill that we had so it almost sounds
 
03:59:02.269 --> 03:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
like the Amendments that people are
 
03:59:04.429 --> 03:59:04.439 align:start position:0%
talking about are not this particular
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
Bill and it one of the things that we
 
03:59:09.790 --> 03:59:09.800 align:start position:0%
heard last year year was a similar
 
03:59:13.269 --> 03:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
situation where a family was very very
 
03:59:15.950 --> 03:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
wronged um it's awful it had to do with
 
03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
child prnography but the bill that was
 
03:59:20.750 --> 03:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
presented to us was not at all the fix
 
03:59:22.710 --> 03:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
that was needed and that's something to
 
03:59:25.670 --> 03:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
think about this is making a a decision
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
based on sentimentality versus what what
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
we have in front of us which was the
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
facts so before we make the well I I
 
03:59:35.349 --> 03:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
would say that interim study um sends
 
03:59:37.229 --> 03:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
the message to the family that we we
 
03:59:40.269 --> 03:59:40.279 align:start position:0%
take their concerns very seriously and
 
03:59:42.870 --> 03:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
we think that uh as some of the members
 
03:59:44.149 --> 03:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
think that there's work that could be
 
03:59:46.750 --> 03:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
done to bring forth that bill or another
 
03:59:48.389 --> 03:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
bill that was similar and this gives it
 
03:59:50.550 --> 03:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to worked so I think
 
03:59:52.950 --> 03:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
that um representative n and then
 
03:59:52.960 --> 03:59:55.030 align:start position:0%
that um representative n and then
representative

03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
stum um I I um take that point um I take
 
04:00:02.870 --> 04:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
that point um the idea of it being based
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
on a certain situation what we end up
 
04:00:06.670 --> 04:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
balancing is the idea of okay is it one
 
04:00:08.950 --> 04:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
isolated situation or is it a situation
 
04:00:10.469 --> 04:00:10.479 align:start position:0%
that has been brought to our attention
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
that is indicative of a trend right and
 
04:00:16.030 --> 04:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
you know I think that we owe this family
 
04:00:17.710 --> 04:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
um Justice when they when they spoke
 
04:00:19.710 --> 04:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
about it um that was what they said they
 
04:00:21.590 --> 04:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
said we were able to have this
 
04:00:23.870 --> 04:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
conversation later but there are you
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
know inevitably other people who go
 
04:00:27.030 --> 04:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
through this who don't have the
 
04:00:28.830 --> 04:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
information who don't have the resources
 
04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
who don't end up doing that so to me
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
that kind of indicates that you know it
 
04:00:34.349 --> 04:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
it's worth us looking into it looking
 
04:00:36.550 --> 04:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
into it to see whether this is a trend
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
or an isolated situation and address the
 
04:00:40.630 --> 04:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
issue that may be larger than think just
 
04:00:43.269 --> 04:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
that one a key part of looking into it
 
04:00:46.429 --> 04:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
is also looking into the uh things that
 
04:00:49.030 --> 04:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
were brought by Chief um aldenberg um
 
04:00:52.469 --> 04:00:52.479 align:start position:0%
with regard to the um director skippa
 
04:00:55.229 --> 04:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
and the council they have the um the
 
04:00:57.269 --> 04:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
ability to look into these things what
 
04:00:59.950 --> 04:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
does that process look like um I'm not
 
04:01:01.750 --> 04:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
sure so that's something we would want
 
04:01:03.870 --> 04:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
to look at representative Stone thank
 
04:01:05.670 --> 04:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to say that this was an
 
04:01:07.349 --> 04:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
issue brought up for a single
 
04:01:09.790 --> 04:01:09.800 align:start position:0%
municipality there are 200 City excuse
 
04:01:11.189 --> 04:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
me 200 towns in New Hampshire and
 
04:01:13.389 --> 04:01:13.399 align:start position:0%
there's 13 cities uh some of those
 
04:01:14.670 --> 04:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
cities choose to have oversight
 
04:01:16.269 --> 04:01:16.279 align:start position:0%
committee such as a police commission
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
that handles police issues that should
 
04:01:20.590 --> 04:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
be more of an issue for the town of
 
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
Derry and their residents who decide if
 
04:01:25.349 --> 04:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
that's the route they want to go to move
 
04:01:27.950 --> 04:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
that forward uh some towns have them
 
04:01:30.070 --> 04:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
some towns don't but if they want
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
oversight that'd be the proper way to go
 
04:01:34.950 --> 04:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think legislating everyone based
 
04:01:37.710 --> 04:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
on one Department's issue is really
 
04:01:39.950 --> 04:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
viable or practical and I and I I really
 
04:01:42.269 --> 04:01:42.279 align:start position:0%
am sympathetic to the family and I don't
 
04:01:43.510 --> 04:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
think there's any legislation and I
 
04:01:44.510 --> 04:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any justice that's
 
04:01:47.710 --> 04:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:51.389 --> 04:01:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:51.399 --> 04:01:53.429 align:start position:0%
 
Pro

04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
Pro
 
04:01:56.030 --> 04:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
so one of the things I've learned in in
 
04:02:00.429 --> 04:02:00.439 align:start position:0%
my years here is I would rather not pass
 
04:02:03.910 --> 04:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
legislation than to pass legislation
 
04:02:07.389 --> 04:02:07.399 align:start position:0%
that doesn't work or bad legislation so
 
04:02:09.229 --> 04:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
either ITF
 
04:02:11.950 --> 04:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
or inum study to try and fix
 
04:02:14.710 --> 04:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
it is the only two things I see but
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
passing a bill that isn't really
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
addressing the family's problem isn't
 
04:02:25.670 --> 04:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to fix their problem right it's
 
04:02:28.269 --> 04:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
still bad legislation that doesn't do
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
what we want it to do so either we take
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
the time and fix it over the summer and
 
04:02:38.830 --> 04:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
have it ready for next year or we put it
 
04:02:40.830 --> 04:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
away and somebody draws up a brand new
 
04:02:42.710 --> 04:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
one for next
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
term that now knows what the issues are
 
04:02:49.469 --> 04:02:49.479 align:start position:0%
but to pass this that doesn't do what
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
what the family wants what's the
 
04:02:56.510 --> 04:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
point representative uh
 
04:03:00.030 --> 04:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
Newman well first say that good or bad
 
04:03:01.710 --> 04:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
legislation is in the eye of the
 
04:03:04.429 --> 04:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
beholder and secondly I'll say that I
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
think my simple solution would be to
 
04:03:09.110 --> 04:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
take the word Sha it's only in there
 
04:03:12.349 --> 04:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
once and change it to May and you would
 
04:03:14.389 --> 04:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
use the normal processes and you would
 
04:03:16.950 --> 04:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
make a request for somebody to to do an
 
04:03:19.149 --> 04:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
investigation and it would go to the ad
 
04:03:21.229 --> 04:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
Journey attorney general or the
 
04:03:23.469 --> 04:03:23.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate person and they would look
 
04:03:25.790 --> 04:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
at the circumstances as to why this
 
04:03:28.189 --> 04:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
investigation was called and they would
 
04:03:30.149 --> 04:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
either decide to do it or not do it I
 
04:03:31.830 --> 04:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
think that that would be a solution that
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
would work
 
04:03:36.309 --> 04:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
also represent man thank you there's
 
04:03:39.469 --> 04:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
already a process for that
 
04:03:41.149 --> 04:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
yeah it's true they they can currently
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
ask um to the attorney general to
 
04:03:46.110 --> 04:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
there's just no mandate that they do so
 
04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I think that this case
 
04:03:49.950 --> 04:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
was doubly investigated um the state
 
04:03:52.710 --> 04:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
police did go back and do
 
04:03:55.349 --> 04:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
a yeah they all came to the same
 
04:03:57.670 --> 04:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
conclusion unfortunately for the for the
 
04:03:59.469 --> 04:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
poor family represent
 
04:04:02.349 --> 04:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you Mr chairman uh I would
 
04:04:05.110 --> 04:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
support a move towards inm study and you
 
04:04:08.189 --> 04:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
know keeping this in the committee until
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the summer and bringing it back
 
04:04:15.429 --> 04:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
next year for the 2025 26 mium just so
 
04:04:16.830 --> 04:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
because obviously there are a number of
 
04:04:18.830 --> 04:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
questions that need to be honed out and
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know like you said complexities with
 
04:04:22.429 --> 04:04:22.439 align:start position:0%
this bill that need to be smoothed out
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
so I think it it would behoove the
 
04:04:27.070 --> 04:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
committee to you know softkill it so to
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
speak and and say that we that's you
 
04:04:32.229 --> 04:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
know it's a bill that is as written is
 
04:04:34.389 --> 04:04:34.399 align:start position:0%
not appropriate would not address the
 
04:04:36.670 --> 04:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
family's situation as happened to them
 
04:04:39.910 --> 04:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
but brings up an important issue and
 
04:04:42.149 --> 04:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
would be worthwhile to study over the
 
04:04:44.590 --> 04:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
summer going into to next year depending
 
04:04:46.550 --> 04:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
on as you say all the time how our
 
04:04:50.670 --> 04:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
elections go so thank you who else
 
04:04:53.070 --> 04:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
representative s sorry thank you very
 
04:04:55.229 --> 04:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
much for for this
 
04:04:58.510 --> 04:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
um again I agree I think interm study
 
04:05:00.349 --> 04:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
would be a better option if we could do
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
that I think also it maybe a simple
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
matter of not necessarily mandating
 
04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
further research but maybe mandating
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
something like police have to have
 
04:05:11.670 --> 04:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
something posted somewhere about if
 
04:05:13.990 --> 04:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
you're concerned that your case is not
 
04:05:15.269 --> 04:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
being heard
 
04:05:17.550 --> 04:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
fairly just like maybe even a poster on
 
04:05:19.510 --> 04:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
the wall like this is how you who you
 
04:05:20.830 --> 04:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
can contact because the general
 
04:05:22.469 --> 04:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
population doesn't necessarily know what
 
04:05:25.630 --> 04:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
that is so some form of like how do you
 
04:05:28.630 --> 04:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.070 --> 04:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
out represent Jam thank you Mr chairman
 
04:05:35.189 --> 04:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
as a resident of the town of seabook
 
04:05:36.830 --> 04:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
that had some police problems in the
 
04:05:38.710 --> 04:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
past is I'm sure sure a lot of people on
 
04:05:41.389 --> 04:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
the committee are aware of um I think
 
04:05:44.030 --> 04:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
that part of the problem here is there
 
04:05:47.710 --> 04:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
are processes for disciplining and for
 
04:05:50.790 --> 04:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
investigating misconduct or uh just
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
simply ethics violations by police
 
04:05:55.030 --> 04:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
officers the problem is the general
 
04:05:58.349 --> 04:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
public isn't aware of what those are um
 
04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
and I joked hey let's go stick another
 
04:06:03.070 --> 04:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
poster in the foyer for the police
 
04:06:04.349 --> 04:06:04.359 align:start position:0%
department I don't think that's the
 
04:06:06.149 --> 04:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
answer I think what we need to do is get
 
04:06:08.229 --> 04:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
the fishing game to do a beautiful video
 
04:06:10.590 --> 04:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
on explaining the law uh because they do
 
04:06:13.269 --> 04:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
a great job with that but I would I
 
04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
would lean toward interim study and I'll
 
04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
make you this promise you if you do it
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh we can have our meeting at Hampton
 
04:06:23.269 --> 04:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
Beach State Park and we'll go out and
 
04:06:26.389 --> 04:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:26.399 --> 04:06:27.990 align:start position:0%
 
Lobster

04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
Lobster
 
04:06:30.750 --> 04:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
yeah well I I believe we can now oh no
 
04:06:33.149 --> 04:06:33.159 align:start position:0%
that the the scuba diving Lobster Bill
 
04:06:36.030 --> 04:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
kill we could actually amend this um
 
04:06:38.469 --> 04:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
anyone else wants to testify or
 
04:06:40.670 --> 04:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
discuss all right uh if if
 
04:06:41.910 --> 04:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative Stone's willing to
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
withdraw the motion and yeah I withdraw
 
04:06:46.309 --> 04:06:46.319 align:start position:0%

04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
to your motion um we received detailed
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
information in regards to what happens
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
at the border and um for those of us
 
04:08:39.910 --> 04:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
that actually listen to this and realize
 
04:08:44.149 --> 04:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:48.349 --> 04:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:50.349 --> 04:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
apologize that's okay what that's your
 
04:08:52.109 --> 04:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
opinion I apologize so what else you
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
want all right thank
 
04:08:59.670 --> 04:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
you so um because of the testimonies
 
04:09:01.229 --> 04:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
that we received and particularly from
 
04:09:01.239 --> 04:09:01.950 align:start position:0%
that we received and particularly from
the

04:09:01.950 --> 04:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:09:04.950 --> 04:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
ACU and the information that was
 
04:09:08.070 --> 04:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
provided to them by law
 
04:09:10.990 --> 04:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement I felt that this definitely
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
needed to pass because it is an issue
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
it's a we're being told it's an issue
 
04:09:18.990 --> 04:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
but the data says there's no
 
04:09:23.309 --> 04:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
issue so um I would like to build a pass
 
04:09:25.349 --> 04:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
because I want to get continue to get
 
04:09:28.990 --> 04:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
more data um I believe last year the
 
04:09:31.109 --> 04:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
data was not available but but it became
 
04:09:34.269 --> 04:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
available since then so now that we do
 
04:09:36.670 --> 04:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
have the data we want to capture it in
 
04:09:40.149 --> 04:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.630 --> 04:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
like speak to your second representative
 
04:09:45.870 --> 04:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
s yes thank you um I think that part of
 
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
our being elected is having fiscal
 
04:09:49.710 --> 04:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the citizens of New
 
04:09:52.710 --> 04:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and where we've expended I
 
04:09:57.309 --> 04:09:57.319 align:start position:0%
think it's $14 million if I'm getting
 
04:10:00.070 --> 04:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
all corre allocated sorry that much
 
04:10:03.189 --> 04:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
money towards addressing the problem we
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
we have an obligation to know what the
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
money is being used for and whether it's
 
04:10:09.510 --> 04:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
being used effectively so that we know
 
04:10:11.189 --> 04:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
whether it makes sense to continue such
 
04:10:13.990 --> 04:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
funding or to repeal that kind of
 
04:10:16.109 --> 04:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
funding and we can't know whether our
 
04:10:18.790 --> 04:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
money is being used effectively in an
 
04:10:21.950 --> 04:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
absence of information and so it's not
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
asking for extensive additional
 
04:10:25.269 --> 04:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
information at saying you've got the
 
04:10:27.149 --> 04:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
information please share it with us so
 
04:10:29.229 --> 04:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
that we can make appropriate financial
 
04:10:32.349 --> 04:10:32.359 align:start position:0%
decisions for the benefit of all
 
04:10:35.109 --> 04:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
citizens further discussion
 
04:10:35.119 --> 04:10:36.429 align:start position:0%
citizens further discussion
representative

04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:40.030 --> 04:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
Jamber yes Mr chairman I will be voting
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
against the OTP motion and I'll tell you
 
04:10:44.910 --> 04:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
why line
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
six um calls for an analysis of the
 
04:10:50.510 --> 04:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of race and ethnicity the
 
04:10:52.750 --> 04:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of the Northern Alliance
 
04:10:56.189 --> 04:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
northern border Alliance program is for
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh migrants that are illegally in the
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
United States of America um and with
 
04:11:05.229 --> 04:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
that in mind I have already uh put a
 
04:11:09.109 --> 04:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
request to OS to to amend the bill uh
 
04:11:11.109 --> 04:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
we'll fight that on the floor I get that
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
um but I think it should be the country
 
04:11:14.429 --> 04:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
of origin or the citizenship of that
 
04:11:17.349 --> 04:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
person uh race and ethnicity I don't
 
04:11:19.269 --> 04:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
need that information to make an
 
04:11:19.279 --> 04:11:21.510 align:start position:0%
need that information to make an
educated

04:11:21.510 --> 04:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
educated
 
04:11:23.710 --> 04:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
um decision on whether it should
 
04:11:26.830 --> 04:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
continue or not so that I'm definitely
 
04:11:28.670 --> 04:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to that that wording so that
 
04:11:32.750 --> 04:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
would be why I'm opposed to an OTV
 
04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
motion thank you representative
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
new um thank you I will be voting uh in
 
04:11:42.590 --> 04:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
favor of OTP um just to the to the point
 
04:11:44.510 --> 04:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
of having that information um that
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
information is essential to
 
04:11:47.630 --> 04:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
understanding whether there is racial
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
profiling happening with it so what kind
 
04:11:52.030 --> 04:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
of other side effects come along with it
 
04:11:54.990 --> 04:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
so um I I think that that's That's
 
04:11:56.830 --> 04:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
essential in assessing whether it's
 
04:11:59.070 --> 04:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
actually achieving its goal or if there
 
04:12:03.309 --> 04:12:03.319 align:start position:0%
are side effects um that are unintended
 
04:12:06.149 --> 04:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
consequences out of curiosity how how
 
04:12:09.269 --> 04:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
does knowing the the race of the people
 
04:12:12.189 --> 04:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
that are being interacted with indicate
 
04:12:16.870 --> 04:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:19.870 --> 04:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
itself the question is if people would
 
04:12:21.870 --> 04:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
be so I I mean I think that's a pretty
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
easy answer actually the um the idea is
 
04:12:28.109 --> 04:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
if if people are being approached or
 
04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
having situations like that interactions
 
04:12:34.349 --> 04:12:34.359 align:start position:0%
based on how they look rather than you
 
04:12:35.790 --> 04:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
know if there's actually a situation
 
04:12:37.349 --> 04:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
where they're uh coming from from
 
04:12:38.590 --> 04:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
another country or something like that
 
04:12:40.630 --> 04:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
so I I I think that's how the racial
 
04:12:43.269 --> 04:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
profiling comes in into play I guess my
 
04:12:46.229 --> 04:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
question is though is how so you don't
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
know that's that's why in other words if
 
04:12:51.030 --> 04:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
if we get a percentage of of certain
 
04:12:54.070 --> 04:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
race that's more than another race in
 
04:12:56.109 --> 04:12:56.119 align:start position:0%
and of itself that's not indicative of
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
racial profile and that's just could be
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
indicative of that's who they
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
encountered how do we get to the
 
04:13:03.429 --> 04:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
question of to your point to know
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's racial profiling just based
 
04:13:08.990 --> 04:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
on Raw data without do you see where I'm
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
going I'm trying yeah I do except that
 
04:13:12.269 --> 04:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
that's not the only piece of data that's
 
04:13:14.670 --> 04:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
being uh that's being reported or
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
proposed to be reported there's multiple
 
04:13:18.349 --> 04:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
points of data that are proposed to be
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
reported in here so I think as a
 
04:13:21.070 --> 04:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
combination of all of these things a
 
04:13:22.510 --> 04:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
combination of all these things in
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
figuring you know seeing the statistics
 
04:13:27.910 --> 04:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
um uh holistically I think that's how
 
04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
you how you would assess that
 
04:13:32.550 --> 04:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
data representative PR and then
 
04:13:32.560 --> 04:13:34.269 align:start position:0%
data representative PR and then
representative

04:13:34.269 --> 04:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:34.279 --> 04:13:36.149 align:start position:0%
representative
Stone

04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
Stone
 
04:13:36.159 --> 04:13:38.030 align:start position:0%
Stone
so

04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:40.830 --> 04:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
more of a comment here is you know I I
 
04:13:43.070 --> 04:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
was looking at the numbers from the ACLU
 
04:13:46.750 --> 04:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
and they're kind of low so are we having
 
04:13:49.349 --> 04:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
low numbers because they know that New
 
04:13:52.109 --> 04:13:52.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire border is being patrolled very
 
04:13:54.550 --> 04:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
well or is it that we don't have enough
 
04:13:56.189 --> 04:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
border agents and a lot of people are
 
04:13:59.710 --> 04:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
just sneaking by them so to say that
 
04:14:01.469 --> 04:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
nobody's coming across just because you
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
haven't found them this isn't like the
 
04:14:05.349 --> 04:14:05.359 align:start position:0%
southern border where you can see people
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
for Miles with no obstructions there's
 
04:14:13.269 --> 04:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
Woods rocks whatever that pretty easy to
 
04:14:17.550 --> 04:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
sneak by people in the woods so uh I'm
 
04:14:20.349 --> 04:14:20.359 align:start position:0%
just putting that out there that and I
 
04:14:23.830 --> 04:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:26.149 --> 04:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
that I've heard in other committees and
 
04:14:28.790 --> 04:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
other things that when you're going to
 
04:14:31.630 --> 04:14:31.640 align:start position:0%
ask somebody or you're going to write
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
down what their race is and you get it
 
04:14:37.830 --> 04:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
wrong then they're
 
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
upset at you because you didn't classify
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
them correctly whereas if you ask them
 
04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
what country did you come from now you
 
04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
know it right I guess sort of in my head
 
04:14:51.990 --> 04:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds better in my head and it's
 
04:14:53.389 --> 04:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
just not coming I think I think it came
 
04:14:53.399 --> 04:14:54.349 align:start position:0%
just not coming I think I think it came
out

04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay um let me see who is next uh
 
04:14:59.830 --> 04:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you I'll be
 
04:15:02.070 --> 04:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh voting in opposition to the utop pass
 
04:15:03.550 --> 04:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
I think the country of origin is vital
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
for border security I think that's
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
imperative that we know that information
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
I think the uh subject of racial
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
profiling is used in this committee and
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
other places way too often and it's
 
04:15:14.469 --> 04:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
getting very
 
04:15:17.950 --> 04:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
old thank you um excuse me
 
04:15:20.109 --> 04:15:20.119 align:start position:0%
representative everyone has a
 
04:15:24.109 --> 04:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
turn thank you Mr chairman um you know
 
04:15:26.830 --> 04:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
as I said in my testimony I well first
 
04:15:30.429 --> 04:15:30.439 align:start position:0%
of all as
 
04:15:33.030 --> 04:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh a political mentor of mine Bernie
 
04:15:34.870 --> 04:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
Sanders said in in a Vox interview in
 
04:15:37.710 --> 04:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
2016 open borders is a Koch brothers
 
04:15:39.950 --> 04:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
proposal that anyone with half a brain
 
04:15:42.269 --> 04:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't support people coming over the
 
04:15:44.590 --> 04:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
border illegally is not good for them
 
04:15:46.349 --> 04:15:46.359 align:start position:0%
it's not good for business it's not good
 
04:15:48.590 --> 04:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
for the country it's not good in general
 
04:15:51.269 --> 04:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
and I I don't support that um what we're
 
04:15:53.990 --> 04:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
talking about here in my opinion is
 
04:15:55.830 --> 04:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have the data on who
 
04:15:57.950 --> 04:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
is crumbing across the border and so to
 
04:15:59.469 --> 04:15:59.479 align:start position:0%
me it's just not
 
04:16:02.309 --> 04:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
a a left or a right issue this this
 
04:16:03.870 --> 04:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
legislation this legislation just gets
 
04:16:05.710 --> 04:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
us to the point where we we know how
 
04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
many people are coming across the New
 
04:16:11.229 --> 04:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire border at a time when the
 
04:16:13.550 --> 04:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
federal government Senator Shaheen has
 
04:16:16.269 --> 04:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
asked secretary mayoras to get us this
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
information and he has refused to to get
 
04:16:23.309 --> 04:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
it or or has been very tiptoe when uh
 
04:16:26.990 --> 04:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
interacting with the uh Senator's office
 
04:16:28.750 --> 04:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
so I think if we're not going to get the
 
04:16:31.030 --> 04:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
data from the feds it's incumbent on us
 
04:16:32.349 --> 04:16:32.359 align:start position:0%
to get the data
 
04:16:36.109 --> 04:16:36.119 align:start position:0%
from us and and and uh collect that data
 
04:16:37.910 --> 04:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
because it's uh important to know who's
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
coming across the border
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
illegally thank you
 
04:16:46.990 --> 04:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
um representative Murray thank you Mr
 
04:16:49.349 --> 04:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
chair um just wanted to make a couple
 
04:16:51.469 --> 04:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
points um to the point of collecting
 
04:16:52.910 --> 04:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
country of origin I would have been
 
04:16:54.670 --> 04:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
happy to drop an amendment to collect
 
04:16:56.309 --> 04:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
that information if I had been given the
 
04:16:59.309 --> 04:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so but I do think that
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
in collecting that information we have
 
04:17:03.070 --> 04:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
to ask the individual what country
 
04:17:05.630 --> 04:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
they're from which we would also ask the
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
individual what race an ethnicity they
 
04:17:09.630 --> 04:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
hold it's asking a question of the
 
04:17:12.510 --> 04:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
individual either way um and to the
 
04:17:14.830 --> 04:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
point of um are we not patrolling the
 
04:17:17.109 --> 04:17:17.119 align:start position:0%
Border enough and that's why the
 
04:17:20.510 --> 04:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
encounters are so low I would
 
04:17:24.189 --> 04:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
um counter that um through operation
 
04:17:27.510 --> 04:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
stone garden we returned um about 30% of
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
the funds that were given to the state
 
04:17:31.349 --> 04:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
in order to patrol the Border back to
 
04:17:32.670 --> 04:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government because we did
 
04:17:35.070 --> 04:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
not use those funds so there's not a
 
04:17:37.510 --> 04:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
lack of resources available for this
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
work um it's simply a lack of need and
 
04:17:42.070 --> 04:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
we're not really arguing here whether
 
04:17:44.750 --> 04:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
the program is necessary or not we're
 
04:17:48.510 --> 04:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
just asking for data um to be given to
 
04:17:50.269 --> 04:17:50.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the public so that
 
04:17:52.269 --> 04:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
we can understand why this expend
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:59.990 --> 04:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
necessary representative Harry gther yes
 
04:18:01.870 --> 04:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
well um I was going to speak to the same
 
04:18:04.670 --> 04:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
thing that um representative Murphy
 
04:18:08.030 --> 04:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
spoke to the fact that there was $4,000
 
04:18:11.550 --> 04:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
and only 30% was used so if there was a
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
a lack of um officers um I think the
 
04:18:19.590 --> 04:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
money was there to get additional offic
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
if that was the case
 
04:18:26.269 --> 04:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
but I'm taking offense to the comment
 
04:18:28.750 --> 04:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
that the moments that uh racial
 
04:18:30.630 --> 04:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
profiling is getting old that
 
04:18:33.870 --> 04:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
conversation it's never old
 
04:18:36.710 --> 04:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
never and I sit here in this commit
 
04:18:38.469 --> 04:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
committee and you want to make a
 
04:18:40.229 --> 04:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
statement that racial profiling is
 
04:18:43.710 --> 04:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
getting old it's not getting old in this
 
04:18:46.109 --> 04:18:46.119 align:start position:0%
state and it is it is getting
 
04:18:50.189 --> 04:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
old it is getting old I think for people
 
04:18:53.109 --> 04:18:53.119 align:start position:0%
of fair minded can say that people on
 
04:18:54.870 --> 04:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
who work in the community of law
 
04:18:57.109 --> 04:18:57.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement to constantly hear racial
 
04:18:59.070 --> 04:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
profiling when they're not doing it it
 
04:19:01.189 --> 04:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
can get old just like people who suffer
 
04:19:03.429 --> 04:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
from racial profiling can say that it's
 
04:19:05.229 --> 04:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
not getting old so I think fair-minded
 
04:19:08.750 --> 04:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
people can disagree with without um yeah
 
04:19:10.670 --> 04:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
okay represent wheeler just really
 
04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
quickly I agree with what you said I
 
04:19:15.070 --> 04:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
think fair-minded people can disagree um
 
04:19:17.469 --> 04:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
I I would also just say that it's uh
 
04:19:19.870 --> 04:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
important to whether it's the term
 
04:19:22.670 --> 04:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
racist or or the term racial profiling
 
04:19:25.229 --> 04:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
to be very careful with what we label as
 
04:19:27.349 --> 04:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
rist or racial profiling because we want
 
04:19:30.149 --> 04:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
that term to mean something and if we
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
use uh the terms racial profiling are
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
racist to describe things that uh
 
04:19:39.510 --> 04:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh aren't that or on the line of that
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
then I think that we dilute the word to
 
04:19:44.670 --> 04:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
to me to mean something not not as
 
04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
impactful as it once
 
04:19:49.710 --> 04:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
did agre represent
 
04:19:51.990 --> 04:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
Newman one way to prevent racial
 
04:19:54.309 --> 04:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
profiling is to have correct
 
04:19:57.389 --> 04:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
data so if we correct if we get the data
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
of the people that are well let's just
 
04:20:01.469 --> 04:20:01.479 align:start position:0%
say where they get feel stopped or
 
04:20:03.189 --> 04:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
whatever get a warning I think there are
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that look like they
 
04:20:07.429 --> 04:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
might be
 
04:20:09.469 --> 04:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants as a lot of people
 
04:20:11.149 --> 04:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
like to refer to people that are that
 
04:20:13.590 --> 04:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
are trying to get into this country I
 
04:20:15.109 --> 04:20:15.119 align:start position:0%
think you might find out that a lot of
 
04:20:18.830 --> 04:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
the people that do get stopped are
 
04:20:21.070 --> 04:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
people that when we collect their
 
04:20:25.030 --> 04:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
citizenship data are people who are US
 
04:20:28.349 --> 04:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
citizens and I know a lot of people that
 
04:20:31.030 --> 04:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
are US citizens that look like they
 
04:20:33.070 --> 04:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
might be migrants they might even speak
 
04:20:35.870 --> 04:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
Spanish all the time and I think the
 
04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
data if if you collect it will be will
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
prove whether there is or not not what
 
04:20:42.429 --> 04:20:42.439 align:start position:0%
somebody's opinion is of whether it's
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
there or not I that's what I believe you
 
04:20:46.750 --> 04:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
need the data so let's just collect the
 
04:20:50.309 --> 04:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
data and make sure we can use the data
 
04:20:53.510 --> 04:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
correctly the issue I have and I'm I'm
 
04:20:55.870 --> 04:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
having um it's becoming more difficult
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
to get over is we keep referencing this
 
04:21:01.950 --> 04:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
this um people who look like illegal
 
04:21:03.670 --> 04:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
immigrants we're talking about the
 
04:21:07.469 --> 04:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
Canadian border and
 
04:21:10.109 --> 04:21:10.119 align:start position:0%
what do Canadians look like I I I'm I'm
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're we're transposing a
 
04:21:15.030 --> 04:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
southern border issue to the northern
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
border I are are are police trying to
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
find brown people out in the middle of
 
04:21:22.750 --> 04:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
the woods I mean I'm trying to figure
 
04:21:24.429 --> 04:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
out where we're getting this allegation
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
this or this suspicion that it may be
 
04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
happening when um we're talking about
 
04:21:32.469 --> 04:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
Canada which is
 
04:21:32.479 --> 04:21:33.990 align:start position:0%
Canada which is
99.999%

04:21:33.990 --> 04:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
99.999%
 
04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
um Caucasian I think so I I get my data
 
04:21:40.590 --> 04:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
from a representative who is a brown
 
04:21:43.590 --> 04:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
person who has been stopped and and on
 
04:21:46.349 --> 04:21:46.359 align:start position:0%
the Canadian border people that live up
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
north of Lone I mean they they do the
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
stops I mean when the when the US they
 
04:21:52.630 --> 04:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
come in here they go 100 miles South of
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
the Border so there's a lot of people
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
that live in Northern New Hampshire yeah
 
04:21:59.229 --> 04:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
that may or may not look like immigrants
 
04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
and if it turns out that that's not
 
04:22:02.469 --> 04:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
happening then fine let's just collect
 
04:22:04.510 --> 04:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
the data and I will say one more thing
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
about the data because we had we've had
 
04:22:08.910 --> 04:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
this discussion before with the police
 
04:22:10.830 --> 04:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
and the police can at least the state
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
police cuz I went to a briefing one time
 
04:22:15.269 --> 04:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
and asked about what do they see on
 
04:22:18.590 --> 04:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
there and and it's usually white and I
 
04:22:19.990 --> 04:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
don't know what all of them are but one
 
04:22:22.710 --> 04:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
of them is unknown so there's a drop-
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
down list where they can collect it so
 
04:22:26.469 --> 04:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
if they can collect the data and we get
 
04:22:28.710 --> 04:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
the L we're spending money to get that
 
04:22:30.870 --> 04:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
data then look at the data and see what
 
04:22:33.910 --> 04:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
the data tells you that's all I'm asking
 
04:22:37.790 --> 04:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
for um representative
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
s oh I'm sorry wait a minute actually
 
04:22:41.790 --> 04:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
representative Balden had her hand up
 
04:22:45.109 --> 04:22:45.119 align:start position:0%
first do you remember
 
04:22:48.870 --> 04:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay on the issue of country aborigin
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
does anyone else in this committee
 
04:22:53.910 --> 04:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
recall when the person who will be
 
04:22:57.070 --> 04:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
speaking next shared that her country of
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
origin due to being an army brat is not
 
04:23:04.710 --> 04:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
the United States and the problems that
 
04:23:07.990 --> 04:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
that presents and also so just
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
remembering that Russia has hundreds of
 
04:23:14.590 --> 04:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
ethnicities of some sort so country of
 
04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
origin isn't informative as far
 
04:23:21.710 --> 04:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
as data
 
04:23:25.030 --> 04:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
on on Behavior that's based on what you
 
04:23:27.349 --> 04:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
see I think that it's not informative
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong repres Jam you
 
04:23:30.870 --> 04:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
meant origin like as where you started
 
04:23:33.109 --> 04:23:33.119 align:start position:0%
your trip not where you necessarily
 
04:23:36.389 --> 04:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
hailed from is it that's correct okay
 
04:23:38.030 --> 04:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay so in other words I think he meant
 
04:23:40.670 --> 04:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
like where you coming from right now not
 
04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
where you your family comes from if you
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
were coming across the border because in
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
my mind I'm visiting this on the border
 
04:23:49.030 --> 04:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not thinking about people driving
 
04:23:51.510 --> 04:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
through a Starbucks 90 miles from the
 
04:23:53.990 --> 04:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
border so that's my bad on that starting
 
04:23:57.030 --> 04:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
to sound like like a potential Fourth
 
04:23:58.830 --> 04:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment issue what country are you
 
04:24:00.910 --> 04:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
coming from it's like were you at the
 
04:24:03.309 --> 04:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
bar tonight Etc no I mean when you're
 
04:24:04.750 --> 04:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
going through a border checkpoint you
 
04:24:06.229 --> 04:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
have to answer those questions
 
04:24:09.550 --> 04:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
representative s thank you and uh just
 
04:24:11.670 --> 04:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
to correct representative Bin's memory
 
04:24:13.149 --> 04:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
it is true that I was not born in the
 
04:24:14.710 --> 04:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
United States because my father worked
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
for United States uh AI usaid which um
 
04:24:23.469 --> 04:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
is an attorney for them um not no um but
 
04:24:25.950 --> 04:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
um what I was going to say is if the the
 
04:24:27.550 --> 04:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
issue so my understanding of the term
 
04:24:30.429 --> 04:24:30.439 align:start position:0%
country of origin is is what's your uh
 
04:24:32.189 --> 04:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
essentially place of birth as what's
 
04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
your personal origin not necessarily
 
04:24:35.950 --> 04:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
where you came from that particular day
 
04:24:39.630 --> 04:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
or month or year um but if if that's
 
04:24:42.309 --> 04:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
really the big issue is that those that
 
04:24:44.710 --> 04:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
phrase is not included in the list could
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
we not simply request an amendment for
 
04:24:48.510 --> 04:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
Monday and then revote or continue this
 
04:24:52.670 --> 04:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
to Monday to add in race ethnicity and
 
04:24:55.349 --> 04:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
country of origin into that list because
 
04:24:57.550 --> 04:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
again much of that data is already being
 
04:24:59.910 --> 04:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
collected we're not asking for new data
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
we're simply ask the the bill as I
 
04:25:04.590 --> 04:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
interpret it is saying you're collecting
 
04:25:06.590 --> 04:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
the data already you have to give it to
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
us and and so if the goal is for us to
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
be responsible about how we're using the
 
04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
people's money and to make sure that
 
04:25:17.229 --> 04:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
we're not you know stealing from those
 
04:25:19.710 --> 04:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
people who claim taxation is that other
 
04:25:22.149 --> 04:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
word um that that we're using their
 
04:25:22.159 --> 04:25:25.469 align:start position:0%
word um that that we're using their
money

04:25:25.469 --> 04:25:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:27.149 --> 04:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
responsibly did you just make a
 
04:25:30.429 --> 04:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
Voldemort reference um Trooper Ma you
 
04:25:32.149 --> 04:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
made a mistake of staying in here I
 
04:25:33.790 --> 04:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
would you mind coming up and I would
 
04:25:35.469 --> 04:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
like to ask a couple questions if you
 
04:25:40.510 --> 04:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:40.520 --> 04:25:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
glad

04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
glad
 
04:25:44.030 --> 04:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
to good after Mr chairman and members of
 
04:25:45.030 --> 04:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for having me
 
04:25:49.710 --> 04:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:52.109 --> 04:25:52.119 align:start position:0%
available there's a debate on as you've
 
04:25:54.189 --> 04:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
heard on what information is
 
04:25:56.910 --> 04:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
collected I'd like to get a better
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
understanding for the committee of what
 
04:26:01.510 --> 04:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about not necessarily the
 
04:26:03.309 --> 04:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
the what information but what is the
 
04:26:05.070 --> 04:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
scenario we're envisioning here where
 
04:26:07.309 --> 04:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
this information are we talking about
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
are you working with border patrol
 
04:26:12.750 --> 04:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
agents um are we explain to me what this
 
04:26:16.830 --> 04:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
scenario this bill in um is is
 
04:26:20.229 --> 04:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
addressing as far as the the field I
 
04:26:21.910 --> 04:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
have not read the bill in its entirety
 
04:26:23.349 --> 04:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for that I'm here for
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
two that are following this one however
 
04:26:28.510 --> 04:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
what I can speak to from um a a road
 
04:26:29.750 --> 04:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint or working the road
 
04:26:32.070 --> 04:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
standpoint is you have a couple of
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
schools of thought and and what I've
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
heard from some testimony here today I
 
04:26:35.760 --> 04:26:37.269 align:start position:0%
heard from some testimony here today I
think

04:26:37.269 --> 04:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
if the committee determines that that
 
04:26:42.030 --> 04:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
data should be collected it should be
 
04:26:43.590 --> 04:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
everything if we're talking about
 
04:26:45.670 --> 04:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
country of origin and race I suppose
 
04:26:47.269 --> 04:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
that's important because it paints a
 
04:26:49.590 --> 04:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
bigger picture than only collecting one
 
04:26:52.189 --> 04:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
or the other however from a practical
 
04:26:54.990 --> 04:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint I ask the committee
 
04:26:57.309 --> 04:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
this the way that I see race or
 
04:26:59.830 --> 04:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
ethnicity is a physical characteristic
 
04:27:01.750 --> 04:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
by which to help identify a person
 
04:27:03.510 --> 04:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
should they not show up in court for a
 
04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle summons or a criminal
 
04:27:05.199 --> 04:27:06.990 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle summons or a criminal
complaint

04:27:06.990 --> 04:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
04:27:09.830 --> 04:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
and so that is what I guess race means
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
to me as an officer that indicates these
 
04:27:14.990 --> 04:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
things or asks the questions of these
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
folks um in preparing charging
 
04:27:18.239 --> 04:27:19.790 align:start position:0%
folks um in preparing charging
documents

04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
documents
 
04:27:21.950 --> 04:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
if what you'll have is a couple of
 
04:27:23.309 --> 04:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
schools of thought out there from a
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
practical standpoint you'll have
 
04:27:26.830 --> 04:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
Troopers and officers that will ask the
 
04:27:29.309 --> 04:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
question on the side of the road to say
 
04:27:31.710 --> 04:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me sir ma'am what is your race
 
04:27:33.550 --> 04:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
what is your weight we have officers and
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
Troopers that don't want to indicate
 
04:27:36.670 --> 04:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
that on the summons
 
04:27:39.469 --> 04:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh for obvious reasons and so we run
 
04:27:42.590 --> 04:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
into a real life scenario of how many
 
04:27:44.870 --> 04:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
unknowns are we going to get in this
 
04:27:47.750 --> 04:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
data and what value does the unknown
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
value provide none um and so you know I
 
04:27:53.229 --> 04:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
asked the committee to consider if
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to mandate that folks
 
04:27:58.510 --> 04:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
working a northern border Alliance uh
 
04:28:00.550 --> 04:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
detail or within that program if we're
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
if we're mandated to collect that of
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
course all we can do is ask the the
 
04:28:07.469 --> 04:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
contact of say whether it's a driver uh
 
04:28:09.429 --> 04:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
pedestrian whatever the case may be what
 
04:28:10.870 --> 04:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
is your race what is your country of
 
04:28:12.550 --> 04:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
origin if they refuse to answer those
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
things I don't think there's anything
 
04:28:15.950 --> 04:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
mandating that they answer those but we
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
hope that they're going to be truthful
 
04:28:19.790 --> 04:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
and give us that information or is it
 
04:28:21.510 --> 04:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of the committee to
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
understand and learn what my perspective
 
04:28:26.189 --> 04:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
is or my educated guess is as to that
 
04:28:28.469 --> 04:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
person's race let's say I guess those
 
04:28:30.510 --> 04:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
are the two questions that I may have or
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
or cause you to pause and think about in
 
04:28:34.750 --> 04:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
the collection of this from a practical
 
04:28:36.510 --> 04:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint what it's going going to tell
 
04:28:39.630 --> 04:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
you um and
 
04:28:42.910 --> 04:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
so I think that's probably a difficult
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
thing if we're dealing with a driver I
 
04:28:47.630 --> 04:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
think we have more ability to ask more
 
04:28:49.870 --> 04:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
probing questions I'll say if it's a a
 
04:28:51.309 --> 04:28:51.319 align:start position:0%
pedestrian or somebody that's just
 
04:28:53.550 --> 04:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
walking along Hall Stream Road in
 
04:28:55.870 --> 04:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh do we do we really have the
 
04:28:58.910 --> 04:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
ability to ask those I guess more deep
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
questions you're going to want that
 
04:29:01.590 --> 04:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
because you're going to want to say well
 
04:29:04.109 --> 04:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
how effective is this program how
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
effective is this initiative and so that
 
04:29:09.149 --> 04:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
I see is sort of the trouble with this
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
these these data points a I think if we
 
04:29:13.750 --> 04:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
don't make them mandatory you have the
 
04:29:16.189 --> 04:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
potential of not having the real picture
 
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
if you do now we run into some other
 
04:29:23.109 --> 04:29:23.119 align:start position:0%
legal issues maybe potentially and um it
 
04:29:24.349 --> 04:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
was one other thing I was going to say
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
oh relative to the 30% of the money that
 
04:29:30.149 --> 04:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
we gave back um I never worked any stone
 
04:29:33.950 --> 04:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
garden details um and I know we had
 
04:29:36.189 --> 04:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
several I I think we had several local
 
04:29:38.389 --> 04:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
Partners in that um with the Coos County
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's department and some other
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
agencies uh every police agency is down
 
04:29:45.870 --> 04:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
the state police is down 68 positions I
 
04:29:48.469 --> 04:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
think today and so while yes I think
 
04:29:50.149 --> 04:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
some of that money went back it wasn't
 
04:29:51.670 --> 04:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
because there wasn't the work it was
 
04:29:53.590 --> 04:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
there wasn't necessarily the Troopers to
 
04:29:56.070 --> 04:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
or the officers to do the work and so I
 
04:29:57.790 --> 04:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
can't speak intelligently to that but I
 
04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
would say that certainly the lack of
 
04:30:01.229 --> 04:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
Troopers or officers probably
 
04:30:03.710 --> 04:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
contributed to why the the details or
 
04:30:06.030 --> 04:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
the funding was not spent uh to some
 
04:30:09.030 --> 04:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
extent anyway I don't I don't know
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
exactly but thank you that was very
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
informative could you describe though
 
04:30:16.910 --> 04:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
what a what what happens at one of those
 
04:30:18.670 --> 04:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
details that's what I'm trying to
 
04:30:20.990 --> 04:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
actually get to what's the interaction
 
04:30:23.469 --> 04:30:23.479 align:start position:0%
what's going on is there are is this car
 
04:30:25.830 --> 04:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
stopped along the road what is this is
 
04:30:28.429 --> 04:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
it like an oui checkpoint how is this
 
04:30:30.389 --> 04:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
data going to be collected yeah as I
 
04:30:31.630 --> 04:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
understand this and again I have not
 
04:30:33.309 --> 04:30:33.319 align:start position:0%
been to the the training for the
 
04:30:35.389 --> 04:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
northern border Alliance um I think I
 
04:30:36.670 --> 04:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
put myself on the list but the
 
04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
likelihood of me getting up there slim
 
04:30:39.630 --> 04:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
to none to be able to you know
 
04:30:41.710 --> 04:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
participate in this and so as I
 
04:30:42.950 --> 04:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
understand it we will be conducting
 
04:30:44.590 --> 04:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
normal course of business in other words
 
04:30:46.510 --> 04:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
Troopers have been trained or officers
 
04:30:48.149 --> 04:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
will be trained shortly the locals that
 
04:30:49.469 --> 04:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to partner with on this
 
04:30:52.830 --> 04:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
initiative um and given some guidelines
 
04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
on on on how to operate what I
 
04:30:56.189 --> 04:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
anticipate again not having tended
 
04:30:57.950 --> 04:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
attended that will be much like other
 
04:31:02.189 --> 04:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
grants or uh activity focused details or
 
04:31:05.229 --> 04:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
or overtime or work that we have whereby
 
04:31:07.229 --> 04:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
it's not that we're you know if we see
 
04:31:09.389 --> 04:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
something suspicious we're going to
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
check on it there's going to have to be
 
04:31:14.109 --> 04:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
some articulable suspicion there for us
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
to stop a person to stop a vehicle to
 
04:31:18.790 --> 04:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
take some action I think you know and
 
04:31:20.030 --> 04:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
again I don't know what's gone into the
 
04:31:21.469 --> 04:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
training but the way that I see it is
 
04:31:23.229 --> 04:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
it's not anything above and beyond what
 
04:31:26.189 --> 04:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
we currently do we may have some Intel
 
04:31:27.710 --> 04:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
or some information from the border
 
04:31:30.030 --> 04:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
patrol that is suggestive to the folks
 
04:31:32.550 --> 04:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
that work these what to look for what an
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
illegal crossing looks like you know I
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
don't know what that might be but um or
 
04:31:38.710 --> 04:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
or things to look for you know some
 
04:31:40.269 --> 04:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
trends that they've seen in vehicles
 
04:31:43.590 --> 04:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
that have come across the border or just
 
04:31:46.309 --> 04:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things I suspect so it's
 
04:31:47.670 --> 04:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
probably the training is probably
 
04:31:49.710 --> 04:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
additional information relative to
 
04:31:51.309 --> 04:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
Illegal border crossings and what to
 
04:31:52.990 --> 04:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
look for but outside of that I suspect
 
04:31:54.830 --> 04:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's a normal course of business if I
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
see a vehicle that's speeding I'm going
 
04:31:58.630 --> 04:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
to stop it um and then maybe once I've
 
04:32:00.030 --> 04:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
got the vehicle stopped maybe there's
 
04:32:02.030 --> 04:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
training that suggests that
 
04:32:04.710 --> 04:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
to determine you know if there's any
 
04:32:06.870 --> 04:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
illegal activ of foot relative to an
 
04:32:09.070 --> 04:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
immigration issue or something like that
 
04:32:11.910 --> 04:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
so um that that's how I see these things
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
happening is normal police work as we've
 
04:32:15.870 --> 04:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
always done it in our local towns and
 
04:32:18.349 --> 04:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
communities regardless of this
 
04:32:20.149 --> 04:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
particular initiative with maybe some
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
additional information on what does
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
illegal Crossing and and illegal
 
04:32:26.030 --> 04:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
Crossing look like and what to look for
 
04:32:28.229 --> 04:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
and to address those things now that
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
we've got that heightened level of
 
04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
training it becomes something that's
 
04:32:34.269 --> 04:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
recognizable or noticeable to us from a
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
a reasonable suspicion standpoint so
 
04:32:39.109 --> 04:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually providing extra
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
patrols really is is that so really what
 
04:32:44.109 --> 04:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to have is you've got this
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
money being used to fund extra patrols
 
04:32:50.070 --> 04:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
within the Border area who are going to
 
04:32:51.790 --> 04:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
be conducting normal routine law
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement but these people who are on
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
these directed patrols are going to have
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
additional training to deal with uh
 
04:33:00.670 --> 04:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
immigration issues a general standpoint
 
04:33:02.590 --> 04:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding yes sir okay
 
04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
thank you that that changes a lot for me
 
04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
04:33:06.320 --> 04:33:07.830 align:start position:0%
all right um
representative

04:33:07.830 --> 04:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:10.349 --> 04:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
jamron thank you Mr
 
04:33:14.029 --> 04:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
chairman you're very familiar with the
 
04:33:18.510 --> 04:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
high-intensity oi patrols um when you
 
04:33:20.349 --> 04:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
conduct one of those in let's say in the
 
04:33:22.990 --> 04:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast Area do you collect this data
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
of race and ethnicity we do not the only
 
04:33:29.189 --> 04:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
time we collect those things for certain
 
04:33:32.510 --> 04:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
is on an arrest thank
 
04:33:35.070 --> 04:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
you this is a um just to be clear this
 
04:33:36.830 --> 04:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
is a an executive session uh he's
 
04:33:39.230 --> 04:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
helping us out um we're not going to put
 
04:33:41.349 --> 04:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
him through the rig so any other
 
04:33:42.670 --> 04:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
questions that are important that we
 
04:33:45.629 --> 04:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
haven't already dealt with that are
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
technical okay thank you thank you for
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
letting me help clarify that I won't
 
04:33:51.789 --> 04:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
bother you again thank you um further
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
discussion based on the information
 
04:33:55.949 --> 04:33:55.959 align:start position:0%
we've just heard um representative
 
04:33:58.629 --> 04:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
Murray um I would just like to request
 
04:34:00.830 --> 04:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
that we hold this bill until Monday so
 
04:34:02.830 --> 04:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
we have time to drop an amendment and
 
04:34:05.390 --> 04:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
also at the beginning of the hearing
 
04:34:06.990 --> 04:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
someone who testified had showed me
 
04:34:08.949 --> 04:34:08.959 align:start position:0%
internal policy that the state police
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
had regarding reporting so they are
 
04:34:12.910 --> 04:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
already doing reporting and from what I
 
04:34:14.510 --> 04:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
can remember there were only one or two
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
items that were different from what's in
 
04:34:18.189 --> 04:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
my bill but I can't remember off the top
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
of my head what those were so I would
 
04:34:20.910 --> 04:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
just like to be able to locate that
 
04:34:22.629 --> 04:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
policy and share with the committee
 
04:34:28.189 --> 04:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:30.830 --> 04:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
vote we'll uh we'll recess this till

technical issues of using a paint on a a
 
04:35:39.670 --> 04:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
tree or fence post or stick or rock as
 
04:35:42.869 --> 04:35:42.879 align:start position:0%
was suggested in the bill um I am a
 
04:35:44.269 --> 04:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
color blind
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
person um I also am a Avid hiker and I
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
do go places where the Trailblazers are
 
04:35:53.629 --> 04:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
purple uh I have an issue with if
 
04:35:55.869 --> 04:35:55.879 align:start position:0%
somebody moves and sells their property
 
04:36:00.349 --> 04:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
to a new land owner that um the do Blaze
 
04:36:02.551 --> 04:36:02.561 align:start position:0%
would still be on the trees and very
 
04:36:05.150 --> 04:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to remove uh I also
 
04:36:08.910 --> 04:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
believe that having a sign uh which is
 
04:36:12.269 --> 04:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
current statute leaves the opportunity
 
04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
for somebody to tell what activities are
 
04:36:16.830 --> 04:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
permitted and what are restricted on
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
their property such as ATV use fishing
 
04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
hunting trapping um hiking uh there are
 
04:36:26.109 --> 04:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
many activities that we do in the
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
outdoors here in New Hampshire and I
 
04:36:31.390 --> 04:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
feel that signage is the better option
 
04:36:34.709 --> 04:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
um and there are resources through the
 
04:36:37.670 --> 04:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
fishing game department and others to
 
04:36:41.310 --> 04:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
assist in posting property the legal way
 
04:36:44.949 --> 04:36:44.959 align:start position:0%
I don't see that as a as a very large uh
 
04:36:47.470 --> 04:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
impediment to a
 
04:36:49.150 --> 04:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
landowner would you like to speak to
 
04:36:54.150 --> 04:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:54.160 --> 04:36:56.590 align:start position:0%
 
Pro

04:36:56.590 --> 04:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
Pro
 
04:37:02.429 --> 04:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
um I agree with most of with all of that
 
04:37:05.590 --> 04:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just leave it at that
 
04:37:07.750 --> 04:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
all right okay we'll come back to you
 
04:37:12.629 --> 04:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:16.230 --> 04:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
discussion okay I'll go okay he remember
 
04:37:17.709 --> 04:37:17.719 align:start position:0%
it came back
 
04:37:20.910 --> 04:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
around so we heard from uh fishing game
 
04:37:24.109 --> 04:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
and and the um timber people that they
 
04:37:26.510 --> 04:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
had do have problems with the
 
04:37:30.029 --> 04:37:30.039 align:start position:0%
paint um and seems to me that they are
 
04:37:30.039 --> 04:37:30.990 align:start position:0%
paint um and seems to me that they are
more

04:37:30.990 --> 04:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:37:33.551 --> 04:37:33.561 align:start position:0%
experienced uh with hearing these
 
04:37:35.150 --> 04:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
problems and understanding these
 
04:37:39.429 --> 04:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
problems so if there's an issue um you
 
04:37:41.750 --> 04:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
even know some people got information
 
04:37:44.590 --> 04:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
from Maine that there was no problems uh
 
04:37:48.269 --> 04:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
we found that there is some controversy
 
04:37:49.990 --> 04:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh on the other side of that saying that
 
04:37:52.450 --> 04:37:52.460 align:start position:0%
there are problems with the paint
 
04:37:52.460 --> 04:37:54.189 align:start position:0%
there are problems with the paint
[Music]

04:37:54.189 --> 04:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:37:57.390 --> 04:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
so I think this needs to go away um and
 
04:38:03.189 --> 04:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:07.150 --> 04:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:08.910 --> 04:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
well uh thank you Mr
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
chairman uh my I just agree with what
 
04:38:13.869 --> 04:38:13.879 align:start position:0%
representative jamen and representative
 
04:38:15.269 --> 04:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
pu said the only thing that I have to
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
add is that as you had mentioned and
 
04:38:19.629 --> 04:38:19.639 align:start position:0%
it's what I was thinking of as well is
 
04:38:22.029 --> 04:38:22.039 align:start position:0%
that this has been Kings land for a long
 
04:38:24.670 --> 04:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
time far beyond uh the United States of
 
04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
America itself and I would worry about
 
04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
the chipping away at that culture of
 
04:38:33.150 --> 04:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
King's land from bills like this and I
 
04:38:34.709 --> 04:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
will be voting for The itl for that
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
reason re I believe in common
 
04:38:39.869 --> 04:38:39.879 align:start position:0%
use thank you I I actually I'll I'll say
 
04:38:42.670 --> 04:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
this I I was I was quasi in favor of
 
04:38:45.230 --> 04:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
this bill um several times now CU it's
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
it's come back and this time what
 
04:38:51.551 --> 04:38:51.561 align:start position:0%
bothered me was the testimony that was
 
04:38:54.029 --> 04:38:54.039 align:start position:0%
clearly designed to to thwart hunting
 
04:38:56.429 --> 04:38:56.439 align:start position:0%
and I'm a Hunter but I'm not that that
 
04:39:00.150 --> 04:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
crazy a hunter but I hunt and to to to I
 
04:39:01.949 --> 04:39:01.959 align:start position:0%
don't like bills that circumnavigate
 
04:39:05.109 --> 04:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
their purpose to do something else um
 
04:39:06.750 --> 04:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
I've said this on many occasions about
 
04:39:09.670 --> 04:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
many things there's proper ways to go
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
after something you don't like and if
 
04:39:13.949 --> 04:39:13.959 align:start position:0%
you want to put that up for a vote then
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
let's discuss that but don't you know
 
04:39:18.429 --> 04:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
don't do something to my leg and tell me
 
04:39:21.189 --> 04:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
it's raining um and that's what I felt
 
04:39:24.551 --> 04:39:24.561 align:start position:0%
would happened there um and I also want
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
while I'm thinking of it the testimony
 
04:39:28.990 --> 04:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
that the representative put forward um
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
regarding uh regarding shooting uh or
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
not ending well for federal agents on
 
04:39:36.910 --> 04:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
his property I will be complaining to
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
the speaker about that that was
 
04:39:39.868 --> 04:39:39.878 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and I hope everyone on
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
this committee took exception to that um
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
so that's where I'm at I liked it and
 
04:39:48.350 --> 04:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
then I didn't um representative s so
 
04:39:49.788 --> 04:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
first I'm left wondering if you hunt
 
04:39:52.990 --> 04:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
wkey wabbits but separately from that I
 
04:39:56.230 --> 04:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
think um you know aside from my passion
 
04:39:57.910 --> 04:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
for the color purple and loving the
 
04:40:00.708 --> 04:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
color purple where I'm really stuck with
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is I am conflicted between the
 
04:40:05.470 --> 04:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
idea that people should have the rights
 
04:40:08.430 --> 04:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
to protect their property and have their
 
04:40:10.550 --> 04:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
property be their own you know the land
 
04:40:13.030 --> 04:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
that I purchase should be mine and the
 
04:40:15.390 --> 04:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
this is a build that says may it it not
 
04:40:17.150 --> 04:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
that I shall so I don't have to use
 
04:40:18.990 --> 04:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
purple paint I can continue to use the
 
04:40:21.070 --> 04:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
yellow but if the purple blazes just
 
04:40:22.830 --> 04:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
mean simply no trespassing then that
 
04:40:24.670 --> 04:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
would also indicate none of those other
 
04:40:27.230 --> 04:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
activities would be allowed and I
 
04:40:30.270 --> 04:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
guess again my brain is not at its best
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
today but trying to narrow down the how
 
04:40:35.550 --> 04:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
we're saying the common good in this
 
04:40:37.948 --> 04:40:37.958 align:start position:0%
particular case outweighs the right of
 
04:40:39.788 --> 04:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
the property owner and I I definitely
 
04:40:42.868 --> 04:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
took exception to that comment but
 
04:40:45.430 --> 04:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's where I was really um getting
 
04:40:48.788 --> 04:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
stuck in into the language
 
04:40:50.990 --> 04:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
so repr
 
04:40:54.910 --> 04:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um I guess to
 
04:40:58.390 --> 04:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
the point of Maine I would just you know
 
04:41:01.070 --> 04:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
say if there's really a problem I don't
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
understand why they wouldn't have
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
repealed this law after such an extended
 
04:41:07.270 --> 04:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
period of time and um like
 
04:41:09.910 --> 04:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative s pointed out this is um
 
04:41:12.110 --> 04:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
not a shell I don't really see the issue
 
04:41:14.550 --> 04:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
with um offering property owners more
 
04:41:16.070 --> 04:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
options especially because it is a
 
04:41:17.788 --> 04:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
physically strenuous activity for many
 
04:41:19.390 --> 04:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
of the elderly property owners in the
 
04:41:21.750 --> 04:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
state to Traverse miles of their
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
property and nail up signs on trees that
 
04:41:26.670 --> 04:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
is damaging to the trees and the plastic
 
04:41:28.670 --> 04:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
signs are damaging to the environment so
 
04:41:31.310 --> 04:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
this seems like it's a way to address
 
04:41:33.788 --> 04:41:33.798 align:start position:0%
several different concerns and I'll also
 
04:41:35.350 --> 04:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
name that I grew up hunting and my dad's
 
04:41:37.788 --> 04:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
a hunter and I'm at all no way against
 
04:41:40.030 --> 04:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
you know the Hunting Community um in
 
04:41:41.670 --> 04:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
fact I'm a former vegan started eating
 
04:41:44.590 --> 04:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
meat again um but I do think that we
 
04:41:46.628 --> 04:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
should give Property Owners um the
 
04:41:49.070 --> 04:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
ability to mark their property this way
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
if they so choose to do so and if other
 
04:41:52.910 --> 04:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
property owners want to continue using
 
04:41:56.030 --> 04:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:58.910 --> 04:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
can rep
 
04:41:58.920 --> 04:42:00.470 align:start position:0%
can rep
representative

04:42:00.470 --> 04:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:42:03.628 --> 04:42:03.638 align:start position:0%
roads thank you Mr chairman the the one
 
04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
question that I had asked
 
04:42:09.230 --> 04:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
was if we start having more than one
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
option is that going to cause confusion
 
04:42:14.430 --> 04:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of people think well
 
04:42:16.430 --> 04:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's ridiculous but I I actually
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
disagree that this has been the norm
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
for I I don't even know how long but I
 
04:42:24.910 --> 04:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
do remember being little and saying what
 
04:42:27.070 --> 04:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
does that mean you know this no trespass
 
04:42:28.990 --> 04:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
but I do know that it meant for me not
 
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
to go there and your property rights in
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this isn't this law is not
 
04:42:35.590 --> 04:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
going to change what your property
 
04:42:37.990 --> 04:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
rights are and
 
04:42:40.590 --> 04:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
the you know the you're allowed to go
 
04:42:42.670 --> 04:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
there unless it's posted that that's the
 
04:42:44.190 --> 04:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
way it is it's still going to be that
 
04:42:45.990 --> 04:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
way so all of a sudden this new argument
 
04:42:48.628 --> 04:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
over well it's my
 
04:42:50.708 --> 04:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
property it was that way last week it's
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to be that way tomorrow regardless
 
04:42:54.190 --> 04:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
if you use purple paint or not and it
 
04:42:57.390 --> 04:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
did seem to me that the given the
 
04:42:58.830 --> 04:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
options I feel like we're trying to fix
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
something that's not
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
broken represent
 
04:43:07.510 --> 04:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
Pro didn't you say this way he did oh it
 
04:43:09.510 --> 04:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
was represent Murray he okay I mean
 
04:43:11.830 --> 04:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
Murphy yep thank you um I just wanted to
 
04:43:13.750 --> 04:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
say that I thoroughly agree with
 
04:43:17.470 --> 04:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
representative selig um this is an
 
04:43:20.110 --> 04:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
option and so that means that people are
 
04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
not forced to put up purple stripes um
 
04:43:26.550 --> 04:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
we heard that the signs can be um
 
04:43:29.708 --> 04:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
written to indicate whatever um can be
 
04:43:31.788 --> 04:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
and even if that there was a um a
 
04:43:34.110 --> 04:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
concern raised about um Hunters maybe
 
04:43:36.030 --> 04:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
from the area not knowing what purple
 
04:43:38.110 --> 04:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
stripes mean but if there's an option to
 
04:43:40.350 --> 04:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
post those signs there's also the option
 
04:43:42.070 --> 04:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
to indicate on those signs what the
 
04:43:44.788 --> 04:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
purple lines mean um so you could you
 
04:43:47.788 --> 04:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
know that wouldn't I I think be a warry
 
04:43:50.470 --> 04:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
and and I agree you know we we have a
 
04:43:52.230 --> 04:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
culture in New Hampshire and we've done
 
04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
things the way we've done them for a
 
04:43:55.750 --> 04:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
long time and I don't think anybody's up
 
04:43:58.510 --> 04:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
to change that but I don't think that
 
04:44:01.550 --> 04:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
property owners um
 
04:44:05.070 --> 04:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
should should feel that they can't host
 
04:44:10.110 --> 04:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
their property because there's a um a an
 
04:44:14.430 --> 04:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
expectation that they have to somehow um
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
be be um concerned
 
04:44:20.830 --> 04:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
about the way things we do here in New
 
04:44:22.470 --> 04:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't want to change that
 
04:44:23.788 --> 04:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
that's true but we also don't want to
 
04:44:25.948 --> 04:44:25.958 align:start position:0%
take the rights of property owners away
 
04:44:28.110 --> 04:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
and you know this is this again I see it
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
as an option people don't have to do it
 
04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
if they don't want to um and there are
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
certainly ways to make it known through
 
04:44:37.110 --> 04:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
fishing game and other uh ways of you
 
04:44:40.270 --> 04:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
know what those purple um lines would be
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
on on trees so um I I'm I'm going to
 
04:44:47.510 --> 04:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
vote to support this bill representative
 
04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
Newman oh I'm sorry yeah Newman I'm also
 
04:44:53.070 --> 04:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
going to uh support this bill for the
 
04:44:54.868 --> 04:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
same reasons I just think it's simpler
 
04:44:56.590 --> 04:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
it's an option and I don't think it's
 
04:44:58.670 --> 04:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
all that confusing and the fact that 21
 
04:45:01.390 --> 04:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
other states have it they haven't been
 
04:45:03.990 --> 04:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
repealed either and I'd also like to
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
correct one thing I believe there was
 
04:45:09.270 --> 04:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
testimony that if you were convicted of
 
04:45:11.350 --> 04:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
this crime it would affect your federal
 
04:45:14.310 --> 04:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
pension as a federal pensioner it
 
04:45:16.510 --> 04:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the only crimes that affect
 
04:45:18.830 --> 04:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
federal pensions are if it's disloyalty
 
04:45:21.628 --> 04:45:21.638 align:start position:0%
the United States treason and couple of
 
04:45:23.470 --> 04:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
others so well that just means you
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to run for president in
 
04:45:28.030 --> 04:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh in Colorado
 
04:45:30.750 --> 04:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
um representative man we'll wait on the
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court on that
 
04:45:35.868 --> 04:45:35.878 align:start position:0%
one so I understand all this talk about
 
04:45:37.510 --> 04:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
having the option that sounds great I'm
 
04:45:40.310 --> 04:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
for options however I asked a specific
 
04:45:42.910 --> 04:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
question in the testimony was given and
 
04:45:45.470 --> 04:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's the same as my experience this only
 
04:45:47.190 --> 04:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
applies to methods of posting your
 
04:45:48.708 --> 04:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
property it doesn't apply to the
 
04:45:51.990 --> 04:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
criminal trespass statute that requires
 
04:45:53.910 --> 04:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
knowingly and you are not going to
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
convict anyone for trespassing on your
 
04:45:57.070 --> 04:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
property because they didn't see a
 
04:45:58.948 --> 04:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
purple stripe it's just not going to
 
04:46:01.628 --> 04:46:01.638 align:start position:0%
happen there's not enough there to prove
 
04:46:03.830 --> 04:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
that person knowingly trespassed with
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
just purple paint as opposed to a sign
 
04:46:07.990 --> 04:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
so you can make it an option I'm Aller
 
04:46:09.070 --> 04:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
options and
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
freedoms but in order to convict anyone
 
04:46:14.110 --> 04:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
of trespassing it's not going to be
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
enough in my opinion thank you thank you
 
04:46:17.600 --> 04:46:19.948 align:start position:0%
enough in my opinion thank you thank you
representative

04:46:19.948 --> 04:46:19.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:46:24.910 --> 04:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
Muse the very fact that we impose a
 
04:46:28.430 --> 04:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
posting requirement on a landowner who
 
04:46:30.750 --> 04:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't want people trespassing on their
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
property um is really unique I mean I
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to post put a sign on my car
 
04:46:39.910 --> 04:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
saying stay out of my car I don't have
 
04:46:42.070 --> 04:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
to post a sign on my house saying stay
 
04:46:43.110 --> 04:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
out of my
 
04:46:47.310 --> 04:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
house um for the life of me I I can't
 
04:46:49.548 --> 04:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
understand how we can talk about
 
04:46:52.910 --> 04:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
property rights one way in the context
 
04:46:55.868 --> 04:46:55.878 align:start position:0%
of one kind of property and then we have
 
04:46:58.750 --> 04:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
this whole different way of talking
 
04:47:00.990 --> 04:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
about it and understanding it when it's
 
04:47:03.390 --> 04:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
a different kind of property and it's
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
all property
 
04:47:07.708 --> 04:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
I don't I I don't understand this we may
 
04:47:11.628 --> 04:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
have a culture uh and that's fine if
 
04:47:14.190 --> 04:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
people if people want to do this if they
 
04:47:16.510 --> 04:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
want to open their lands up to people
 
04:47:19.070 --> 04:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
for for hiking for swimming for hunting
 
04:47:22.110 --> 04:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
whatever that's awesome you know and and
 
04:47:23.548 --> 04:47:23.558 align:start position:0%
I think we should we should encourage
 
04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
people to do that but people who do not
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
want other people tromping around in
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
their property should not have other
 
04:47:32.030 --> 04:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
people trapping around on their property
 
04:47:34.390 --> 04:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
now just the other day um one one of the
 
04:47:36.910 --> 04:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
things that we passed um in in our house
 
04:47:40.030 --> 04:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
session was a law that allows uh Hunters
 
04:47:42.070 --> 04:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
to use different kinds of
 
04:47:42.080 --> 04:47:43.670 align:start position:0%
to use different kinds of
guns

04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
guns
 
04:47:47.150 --> 04:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
um a higher caliber uh in you know a
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
higher caliber firearms and hunting
 
04:47:53.150 --> 04:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
we're starting to see um you know a push
 
04:47:55.750 --> 04:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
by more people to use things like AR-15s
 
04:47:58.230 --> 04:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
for hunting I think people have very
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
good reasons I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
 
04:48:03.040 --> 04:48:07.390 align:start position:0%
good reasons I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
sorry

04:48:07.390 --> 04:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:09.948 --> 04:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
we have very good reasons people have
 
04:48:11.270 --> 04:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
very good reasons and they have their
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
own reasons for wanting to keep other
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
people off their
 
04:48:18.708 --> 04:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
property um and we may we don't have to
 
04:48:20.948 --> 04:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
like them we don't have to agree with
 
04:48:25.350 --> 04:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
them but I think we have to respect them
 
04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to do under the law
 
04:48:29.948 --> 04:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
not to create exceptions where
 
04:48:33.590 --> 04:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
exceptions don't exist all this law does
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
is simply provide another way for a
 
04:48:39.190 --> 04:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
property owner to make their feelings
 
04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
clear about how they want their land to
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
be used that is it and I really don't
 
04:48:47.830 --> 04:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
see the issue with it thank you
 
04:48:47.840 --> 04:48:49.270 align:start position:0%
see the issue with it thank you
represent

04:48:49.270 --> 04:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:48:51.708 --> 04:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you Mr chair so the
 
04:48:53.510 --> 04:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
difference in that is if I walk up to
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
your home and your car I know I don't
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
belong in there but if I'm on
 
04:49:00.548 --> 04:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
conservation land and I happened upon
 
04:49:02.190 --> 04:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
your land by accident because it borders
 
04:49:04.510 --> 04:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
it I may not know that that's why the
 
04:49:06.548 --> 04:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
reposting is required in order to
 
04:49:08.948 --> 04:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
convict somebody of Criminal Trespass
 
04:49:10.670 --> 04:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
that's the difference I know your car I
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
can't go in it I know your house I can't
 
04:49:14.590 --> 04:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
go in it I may not know your 100 Acre
 
04:49:16.030 --> 04:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
property that a buts conservation land
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
is off limits unless it's posted that's
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative Stone thank
 
04:49:23.948 --> 04:49:23.958 align:start position:0%
you uh in regards to this issue uh
 
04:49:25.910 --> 04:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
education was mentioned on how to inform
 
04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
the public of the new uh requirements
 
04:49:30.390 --> 04:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
used utilizing a fishing game and i'
 
04:49:32.310 --> 04:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
just like to point out that in 2023
 
04:49:34.430 --> 04:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
168,000 licenses were were issued to
 
04:49:36.350 --> 04:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
include non-resident and Resident that's
 
04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
a very small percentage of a population
 
04:49:40.470 --> 04:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
that comes through New Hampshire uh to
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
try to inform them of this new purple
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
marking in addition uh an individual
 
04:49:46.030 --> 04:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
land owner has the option of prohibiting
 
04:49:47.708 --> 04:49:47.718 align:start position:0%
hunting but allowing other activities to
 
04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
take part of their property such as ohrv
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh snow machines and various other
 
04:49:54.948 --> 04:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
activities but they may be totally
 
04:49:57.310 --> 04:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
against trapping or hunting of animals
 
04:49:58.990 --> 04:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
at least with a sign it's definitive and
 
04:50:01.390 --> 04:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
it gives you proper notice when you do
 
04:50:04.150 --> 04:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
come upon the property a purple Mark
 
04:50:06.070 --> 04:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't discriminate with what you can
 
04:50:08.190 --> 04:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
do or what you can't do only saying that
 
04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
you're prohibited in its
 
04:50:12.670 --> 04:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
entirety thank you I okay that I think
 
04:50:14.230 --> 04:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
everyone's had a chance to speak repr
 
04:50:16.670 --> 04:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
Balon go
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
ahead thanks for letting me drag this on
 
04:50:24.230 --> 04:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
um so if I understand correctly the only
 
04:50:27.030 --> 04:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
way to get a conviction is to prove that
 
04:50:29.230 --> 04:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
they know that they knew that they
 
04:50:32.270 --> 04:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't trespass that they were
 
04:50:36.030 --> 04:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
trespassing and men R they and if I
 
04:50:36.040 --> 04:50:37.230 align:start position:0%
trespassing and men R they and if I
understand

04:50:37.230 --> 04:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:50:40.990 --> 04:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
correctly it would probably be necessary
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
for them to repeatedly do this for the
 
04:50:47.948 --> 04:50:47.958 align:start position:0%
property owner to be frustrated enough
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
to want them arrested or
 
04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
charged and so in theory once we have
 
04:50:57.510 --> 04:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
multiple times of them walking past
 
04:51:02.030 --> 04:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
purple paint they know and the evidence
 
04:51:04.110 --> 04:51:04.120 align:start position:0%
is there that they know and it's sounds
 
04:51:06.190 --> 04:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
more like this bill is about making sure
 
04:51:09.390 --> 04:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
that people who don't have the physical
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
ability to post the kind of sign that's
 
04:51:14.830 --> 04:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
required by law can still pursue a
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
conviction as long as they're
 
04:51:21.070 --> 04:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
posting under what the law permits like
 
04:51:23.548 --> 04:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
if that's I don't know that
 
04:51:28.350 --> 04:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
that's a significant problem um it it's
 
04:51:30.990 --> 04:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
just another way to communicate your
 
04:51:33.948 --> 04:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
preferences should it ever come to be a
 
04:51:35.910 --> 04:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
situation where your only option that
 
04:51:38.270 --> 04:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
you have left is to press charges that
 
04:51:38.280 --> 04:51:40.190 align:start position:0%
you have left is to press charges that
doesn't

04:51:40.190 --> 04:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
04:51:42.310 --> 04:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
seem I don't know why that would be
 
04:51:45.230 --> 04:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
problematic thanks thank
 
04:51:48.350 --> 04:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
you um everyone's had a chance to speak
 
04:51:50.070 --> 04:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to just steal a quick last
 
04:51:52.350 --> 04:51:52.360 align:start position:0%
word for myself I I am I'm not going to
 
04:51:55.310 --> 04:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
really discuss the the the semantics of
 
04:51:58.230 --> 04:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
the bill but I want to go back just
 
04:52:01.070 --> 04:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
again to to the history of the people
 
04:52:03.470 --> 04:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
that founded this country just came from
 
04:52:06.750 --> 04:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
a country where during a famine they
 
04:52:09.390 --> 04:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
would sneak into the king's land and
 
04:52:11.868 --> 04:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
kill a deer to feed their family and
 
04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
they would be publicly executed for
 
04:52:15.788 --> 04:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
trespassing on the king's land and
 
04:52:18.510 --> 04:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
taking the king's deer the people here
 
04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
said we're going to you know what you
 
04:52:21.750 --> 04:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
can own your own land but we're going to
 
04:52:24.030 --> 04:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
assume it's open to everyone to hunt and
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
use for our
 
04:52:28.390 --> 04:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
enjoyment unless
 
04:52:31.110 --> 04:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise posted so they we made it so
 
04:52:33.030 --> 04:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
you had you could post it but it wasn't
 
04:52:34.750 --> 04:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
it wasn't exactly the easiest thing in
 
04:52:36.910 --> 04:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
the world whether we've evolved now to
 
04:52:38.910 --> 04:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
decide we're going to go back to the
 
04:52:41.590 --> 04:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
land owners rights over the people who
 
04:52:43.350 --> 04:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
don't I would remind us that the vast
 
04:52:45.350 --> 04:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
majority of New Hampshire citizens do
 
04:52:47.868 --> 04:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
not own property they may never own
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
property they can't afford it they never
 
04:52:53.350 --> 04:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
will so if if this catches on it becomes
 
04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
much easier to post your land and we
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
decide we see people we don't like to
 
04:53:00.070 --> 04:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
look at them um we know we're concerned
 
04:53:02.708 --> 04:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
about um profiling up in the woods of
 
04:53:04.750 --> 04:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
the north it it you know people are
 
04:53:06.830 --> 04:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
going to get that way and as further
 
04:53:08.948 --> 04:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
baniz us I think we should continue to
 
04:53:11.230 --> 04:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
share our property and share our land
 
04:53:13.030 --> 04:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
and if you definitely don't want someone
 
04:53:15.750 --> 04:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
there you can do it and you can post it
 
04:53:17.110 --> 04:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
um but I just don't think we should be
 
04:53:19.070 --> 04:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
making it that much easier to keep
 
04:53:20.670 --> 04:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
people who can't afford a piece of
 
04:53:22.510 --> 04:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
property from being able to use the
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
outdoors with that I'm going to ask the
 
04:53:26.030 --> 04:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role the motion on the
 
04:53:28.030 --> 04:53:28.040 align:start position:0%

Monday morning okay because we're up
 
04:54:44.628 --> 04:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
against the deadline and with that I
 
04:54:46.548 --> 04:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
close the executive session and wait a
 
04:54:48.990 --> 04:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
minute who made the motion to itl
 
04:54:50.750 --> 04:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative Jamon um I'll need your
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%

04:54:54.590 --> 04:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
you and that's it for the day and I will
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:02.400 --> 05:04:56.948 align:start position:0%
 
Monday

05:04:56.948 --> 05:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:59.868 --> 05:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that
 
05:05:02.990 --> 05:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Muse has an amendment
 
05:05:06.830 --> 05:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
that basically replaces the bill and I'm
 
05:05:12.510 --> 05:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:14.590 --> 05:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much during
 
05:05:17.750 --> 05:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
testimony of the bill we heard um uh I
 
05:05:19.948 --> 05:05:19.958 align:start position:0%
think the the the consensus is we may
 
05:05:21.670 --> 05:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
have something here but there are some
 
05:05:24.868 --> 05:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
issues with it um and uh representative
 
05:05:28.110 --> 05:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
Ms essentially has gone back over uh his
 
05:05:30.190 --> 05:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
bill and one of the things I've I've
 
05:05:32.868 --> 05:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
asked him to do is to make changes uh to
 
05:05:34.830 --> 05:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
the bill and and that this has come back
 
05:05:37.030 --> 05:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
to us in the form of a full Bill
 
05:05:39.830 --> 05:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment so what would what I think
 
05:05:41.430 --> 05:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
would be a good way to start would just
 
05:05:44.270 --> 05:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
be to ask representative bus to come up
 
05:05:46.830 --> 05:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
and just walk us through uh the changes
 
05:05:50.230 --> 05:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
that he's made and I I know there we had
 
05:05:51.750 --> 05:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
there were changes around there were
 
05:05:53.590 --> 05:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
issues around things like the effective
 
05:05:56.230 --> 05:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
date uh and and several other things
 
05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:01.400 --> 05:06:04.948 align:start position:0%
 
up

05:06:04.948 --> 05:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
please join us we're not nearly as
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:15.230 --> 05:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittees great thank you um yeah
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
the the the changes or the the concerns
 
05:06:23.708 --> 05:06:23.718 align:start position:0%
that that I heard were most of them were
 
05:06:28.750 --> 05:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
around um funding um and the potential
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
impact this bill might have on um the
 
05:06:34.350 --> 05:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
need need for the various departments
 
05:06:38.230 --> 05:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
that were identified to have to hire
 
05:06:40.830 --> 05:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
either hire new Personnel or or buy or
 
05:06:42.070 --> 05:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
buy new
 
05:06:42.080 --> 05:06:43.670 align:start position:0%
buy new
equipment

05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
05:06:48.070 --> 05:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
um and um so what what what I've done
 
05:06:51.948 --> 05:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
with this with this amendment is
 
05:06:54.548 --> 05:06:54.558 align:start position:0%
um the what we've done is we've pushed
 
05:06:57.750 --> 05:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
the effective date of the changes in
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
statute that we were recommending and if
 
05:07:01.990 --> 05:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
you remember from my testimony I
 
05:07:04.110 --> 05:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the Lion Share of the
 
05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
bill sections 2 through 23 of the bill
 
05:07:12.390 --> 05:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
um involves changes in statute that
 
05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
would allow various agencies to be able
 
05:07:19.628 --> 05:07:19.638 align:start position:0%
to collect um collect um
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
fingerprints um what we've done is we've
 
05:07:24.190 --> 05:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
delayed in the bill in the amendment
 
05:07:26.830 --> 05:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
we've delayed the effective date of that
 
05:07:30.110 --> 05:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
of those changes until June 30th of
 
05:07:33.910 --> 05:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
2025 so the end of the current budget
 
05:07:37.990 --> 05:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
cycle um but what we have are continuing
 
05:07:42.590 --> 05:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
to do is allow the task force that this
 
05:07:45.150 --> 05:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
bill or an amendment would
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
create to Begin work as soon as uh
 
05:07:52.110 --> 05:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
possible after the bill is signed into
 
05:07:55.350 --> 05:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
law and the the rationale for that is
 
05:07:57.628 --> 05:07:57.638 align:start position:0%
that if the bill is signed in the law
 
05:08:03.150 --> 05:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
for example in you know July 1st um
 
05:08:05.868 --> 05:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
the the bill requires that the task
 
05:08:10.750 --> 05:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
force um produce its initial report by
 
05:08:13.788 --> 05:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
November 1st of this year and that
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
presumably would be in that report if
 
05:08:19.948 --> 05:08:19.958 align:start position:0%
any agency had a cons had a need for
 
05:08:21.788 --> 05:08:21.798 align:start position:0%
additional funding that would be
 
05:08:24.350 --> 05:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
identified in that report and then that
 
05:08:26.470 --> 05:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
could then be included in the budget
 
05:08:29.750 --> 05:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's being proposed for the next
 
05:08:33.948 --> 05:08:33.958 align:start position:0%
bium um so that any agency that felt
 
05:08:36.190 --> 05:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
they needed to either hire additional
 
05:08:39.270 --> 05:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
people or purchase additional equipment
 
05:08:42.868 --> 05:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
um they would have the ability once the
 
05:08:45.390 --> 05:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
statute goes into effect at the end of
 
05:08:48.628 --> 05:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
June to then purchase the material
 
05:08:51.390 --> 05:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
purchase what they need in the in the S
 
05:08:53.270 --> 05:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh succeeding fiscal
 
05:08:56.430 --> 05:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
year um so that is that is the major
 
05:09:00.830 --> 05:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
change we made um you know I I spoke the
 
05:09:01.868 --> 05:09:01.878 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
05:09:04.030 --> 05:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
Service serves was the one that had been
 
05:09:08.030 --> 05:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
the most concerned about that um after
 
05:09:10.590 --> 05:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing we got together and we
 
05:09:12.990 --> 05:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
talked about exactly what I described
 
05:09:14.948 --> 05:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
and they they appeared to be very
 
05:09:19.030 --> 05:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
agreeable to that um and um so we're
 
05:09:21.150 --> 05:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
moving forward with that in the
 
05:09:25.510 --> 05:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
amendment the other change in the bill
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
um is more of a housekeeping U matter um
 
05:09:34.390 --> 05:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
in one of of the intentions of this bill
 
05:09:38.150 --> 05:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
was to get uniformity
 
05:09:42.510 --> 05:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
in the language in statute as it as it
 
05:09:47.830 --> 05:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
empowers different agencies to um to
 
05:09:50.110 --> 05:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
collect um
 
05:09:52.310 --> 05:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
fingerprints and and what we noticed
 
05:09:53.548 --> 05:09:53.558 align:start position:0%
when we were doing that and
 
05:09:55.868 --> 05:09:55.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we didn't finish we didn't
 
05:09:57.470 --> 05:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
do as thorough a job as we would have
 
05:09:59.110 --> 05:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
liked Before the bill was submitted but
 
05:10:01.110 --> 05:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
in doing this final review we noticed
 
05:10:02.670 --> 05:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
that there were
 
05:10:04.948 --> 05:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
inconsistent other inconsistencies that
 
05:10:07.788 --> 05:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
we didn't that that we didn't notice so
 
05:10:10.868 --> 05:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
what we have done is if you look at if
 
05:10:13.830 --> 05:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
you look on page
 
05:10:18.430 --> 05:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
three um in line
 
05:10:21.830 --> 05:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
13 um you'll see some italicized
 
05:10:26.230 --> 05:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
language there we have made sure that
 
05:10:30.750 --> 05:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
that language is put in place in every
 
05:10:33.750 --> 05:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
RSA that empowers a particular
 
05:10:35.788 --> 05:10:35.798 align:start position:0%
department so that it's
 
05:10:38.548 --> 05:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
consistent and what the language says is
 
05:10:41.470 --> 05:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
that fingerprints uh may be taken by a
 
05:10:44.310 --> 05:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
qualified law enforcement agency an
 
05:10:46.390 --> 05:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
authorized employee of the Department of
 
05:10:49.150 --> 05:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
Safety or an authorized employee of the
 
05:10:51.510 --> 05:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
Department of in this in the example
 
05:10:53.030 --> 05:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration but it would be
 
05:10:56.030 --> 05:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
any department and that that and that
 
05:10:57.510 --> 05:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
that position would be approved by the
 
05:10:58.990 --> 05:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner of depart of the Department
 
05:11:01.030 --> 05:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
of Safety and that L that last bit of
 
05:11:02.350 --> 05:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
language they're approved by the
 
05:11:04.390 --> 05:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of Safety
 
05:11:06.830 --> 05:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
is important because there is still
 
05:11:08.430 --> 05:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
going to need to be
 
05:11:11.750 --> 05:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
some basic level of training and and
 
05:11:13.030 --> 05:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
competence that the individuals are
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
going to have and and and the department
 
05:11:17.670 --> 05:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
of safety as the agency that's
 
05:11:20.470 --> 05:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for interacting with the FBI
 
05:11:23.030 --> 05:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
they still want to have some um
 
05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility for that um so that and
 
05:11:28.190 --> 05:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
that's now consistent in each of the the
 
05:11:31.390 --> 05:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
RSA references that we have in here
 
05:11:33.788 --> 05:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
other than that the bills is is the same
 
05:11:38.470 --> 05:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:41.868 --> 05:11:41.878 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative Muse the
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:11:45.750 --> 05:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
I believe also expressed some concerns
 
05:11:49.070 --> 05:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
over the fact that um they may have to
 
05:11:51.868 --> 05:11:51.878 align:start position:0%
do this a lot and there may be uh you
 
05:11:53.310 --> 05:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
know some significant additional
 
05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
training that's required is that one of
 
05:11:58.150 --> 05:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
the issues that you would expect to deal
 
05:11:59.990 --> 05:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
with or or you would expect the task
 
05:12:01.548 --> 05:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
force to deal with whatever the final
 
05:12:03.628 --> 05:12:03.638 align:start position:0%
recomend commendations would be for the
 
05:12:06.030 --> 05:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
implementation uh kind of across the
 
05:12:07.868 --> 05:12:07.878 align:start position:0%
board within different
 
05:12:10.590 --> 05:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
agencies yeah exactly I mean that you
 
05:12:13.390 --> 05:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
know that would be my I would Envision
 
05:12:15.270 --> 05:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
the the members of the task force
 
05:12:16.628 --> 05:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
getting together and if the Health and
 
05:12:18.510 --> 05:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
Human Services had a particular concern
 
05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
about you know training um that they
 
05:12:23.390 --> 05:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
need additional training that that would
 
05:12:25.868 --> 05:12:25.878 align:start position:0%
be identified the department of safety
 
05:12:29.110 --> 05:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
would um you know respond to that if
 
05:12:30.868 --> 05:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
they needed additional resources that
 
05:12:32.708 --> 05:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
would be included in the report and then
 
05:12:34.470 --> 05:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
that would be presumably included in the
 
05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:46.990 --> 05:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
you just for clarification so what I'm
 
05:12:48.670 --> 05:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
looking at is each section talks about
 
05:12:50.750 --> 05:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
each different department if you will in
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
the statute that relates to that
 
05:12:54.628 --> 05:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
department so and it's all all the same
 
05:12:57.868 --> 05:12:57.878 align:start position:0%
I know there was a concern about shall
 
05:12:59.670 --> 05:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
have we fixed that with the time frame
 
05:13:01.350 --> 05:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
being implemented I know Department of
 
05:13:03.510 --> 05:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
Heth and Services were afraid
 
05:13:05.910 --> 05:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
that if this was implemented and they
 
05:13:08.270 --> 05:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
weren't up to to speed with it people
 
05:13:10.150 --> 05:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
would come to see them expecting that
 
05:13:12.628 --> 05:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
they they're up to speed with it I I I
 
05:13:14.670 --> 05:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
think we have I think by delaying the
 
05:13:16.430 --> 05:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
effective date of the statute I mean it
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
does give it gives the entities an
 
05:13:21.470 --> 05:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get up to speed I mean I
 
05:13:23.310 --> 05:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
think there in all honesty there's
 
05:13:24.788 --> 05:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
probably still going to be a little bit
 
05:13:27.548 --> 05:13:27.558 align:start position:0%
of a period where you know if somebody
 
05:13:29.110 --> 05:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
walked into the Department of Health and
 
05:13:32.590 --> 05:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
Human Services on July 1st of 2025 five
 
05:13:34.510 --> 05:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
they may not have everything in place
 
05:13:39.270 --> 05:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
that they need but um you know I I I I
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
that uh they they did not have a chance
 
05:13:55.868 --> 05:13:55.878 align:start position:0%
to see it before the me meeting but it
 
05:13:57.788 --> 05:13:57.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's consistent with everything
 
05:13:59.788 --> 05:13:59.798 align:start position:0%
that we talked about when we when we met
 
05:13:59.798 --> 05:14:00.670 align:start position:0%
that we talked about when we when we met
with

05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:14:00.680 --> 05:14:03.628 align:start position:0%
with
them

05:14:03.628 --> 05:14:03.638 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:14:03.638 --> 05:14:05.868 align:start position:0%
them
I

05:14:05.868 --> 05:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:08.030 --> 05:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
asked representative G right you have a
 
05:14:10.830 --> 05:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
question yeah um I don't know why but I
 
05:14:13.830 --> 05:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
had a notation here um in the section
 
05:14:15.430 --> 05:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
that talked about the task force shall
 
05:14:17.868 --> 05:14:17.878 align:start position:0%
report its initial findings and any
 
05:14:20.110 --> 05:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations for proposed legislation
 
05:14:22.990 --> 05:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
to the Speaker of the House da da da by
 
05:14:24.390 --> 05:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
November 1st
 
05:14:27.990 --> 05:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
2024 and my note that I made said DHS
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
don't have the resource for November the
 
05:14:34.910 --> 05:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:36.990 --> 05:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
just be before you answer that
 
05:14:38.910 --> 05:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
representative let me just is is there

1197 there are representatives from the
 
05:14:57.868 --> 05:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety here and the
 
05:14:59.350 --> 05:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Revenue Administration
 
05:15:02.110 --> 05:15:02.120 align:start position:0%

conversation happy to good afternoon
 
05:15:13.788 --> 05:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
Lindsay step I'm the commissioner at the
 
05:15:15.548 --> 05:15:15.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration so
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
we're obviously one of the agencies that
 
05:15:18.548 --> 05:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
are required to perform background
 
05:15:21.868 --> 05:15:21.878 align:start position:0%
checks on our employees um we worked
 
05:15:23.670 --> 05:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
with representative Ms um on this
 
05:15:26.310 --> 05:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
amendment and and we're comfortable um
 
05:15:28.670 --> 05:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
with how this bill reads it makes the
 
05:15:30.548 --> 05:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
language within our statute consistent
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
with all the other statutes shs as to
 
05:15:34.150 --> 05:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
who can perform the background checks
 
05:15:36.590 --> 05:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable in terms of the timing
 
05:15:38.230 --> 05:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
um we are a member of the task force and
 
05:15:40.830 --> 05:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
we're happy to do that as well and I'm
 
05:15:42.150 --> 05:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions about the
 
05:15:43.788 --> 05:15:43.798 align:start position:0%
process and what we do and why we do it
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
if that's
 
05:15:48.110 --> 05:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
helpful representative Lindsay
 
05:15:52.910 --> 05:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
stpp last name is Step s PP first name
 
05:15:55.628 --> 05:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
Lindsay and this isn't really a question
 
05:15:57.310 --> 05:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
this just maybe to answer what you had
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
you might be asking the same thing that
 
05:16:01.548 --> 05:16:01.558 align:start position:0%
I had because DHHS had a specific
 
05:16:03.390 --> 05:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
concern about the time frame the
 
05:16:04.670 --> 05:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
November time frame but I think that's
 
05:16:08.390 --> 05:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
been answered by it being June
 
05:16:11.230 --> 05:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
now I know that's that was the other one
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
I did Mark that as well at the one at
 
05:16:18.350 --> 05:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
the very end this is the one that
 
05:16:21.390 --> 05:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
correct the resource issue that DHHS may
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
have been speaking about was could have
 
05:16:25.788 --> 05:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
been budget my my guess is it was budget
 
05:16:28.030 --> 05:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
and financial to actually do the
 
05:16:30.990 --> 05:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
implementation um in this fiscal year so
 
05:16:33.390 --> 05:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
actually pushing the effective date out
 
05:16:36.470 --> 05:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
would seem to help that a lot
 
05:16:38.910 --> 05:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
okay yeah from our agency's perspective
 
05:16:40.310 --> 05:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
the change in the effective date I think
 
05:16:42.070 --> 05:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
is helpful it allows the task force to
 
05:16:45.190 --> 05:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
get underway start to address any
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns as the sponsor
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned potential funding problems or
 
05:16:51.708 --> 05:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
funding issues that we need to address
 
05:16:53.708 --> 05:16:53.718 align:start position:0%
in the budget but the effective date
 
05:16:58.150 --> 05:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
Ming being moved back to um June 30
 
05:17:00.470 --> 05:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
20255 allows us to address those things
 
05:17:02.708 --> 05:17:02.718 align:start position:0%
in the task force beforehand and then as
 
05:17:04.708 --> 05:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
he mentioned the final report from the
 
05:17:10.150 --> 05:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
task force will occur um 2 months after
 
05:17:12.430 --> 05:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
the effective date so we'll again be
 
05:17:14.868 --> 05:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
able to comment on anything that um we
 
05:17:16.390 --> 05:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
need to address anything that the task
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
force needs to with respect to this
 
05:17:18.000 --> 05:17:26.628 align:start position:0%
force needs to with respect to this
going

05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:28.788 --> 05:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
live I was trying to
 
05:17:32.510 --> 05:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
write so if if I just may ask a quick
 
05:17:34.548 --> 05:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
question this was something that I asked
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
when we we heard this in the committee
 
05:17:38.830 --> 05:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
and the answer then was they didn't
 
05:17:40.190 --> 05:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
think this would affected at all but
 
05:17:41.990 --> 05:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
there was actually a subcommittee I'm
 
05:17:44.110 --> 05:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
sorry it was a study committee that was
 
05:17:46.990 --> 05:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
made for the purpose of
 
05:17:48.788 --> 05:17:48.798 align:start position:0%
centralized background checks
 
05:17:50.350 --> 05:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
fingerprints and I think it had more to
 
05:17:53.548 --> 05:17:53.558 align:start position:0%
do with schools did you have you heard
 
05:17:54.990 --> 05:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
anything about that because I'm just
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
wondering if this would kind of address
 
05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
that situation that subcommittee I was
 
05:18:01.868 --> 05:18:01.878 align:start position:0%
on it but we've never met or sorry study
 
05:18:04.190 --> 05:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
committee we've never met so I think for
 
05:18:06.670 --> 05:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
our purposes I'm not sure that that
 
05:18:09.070 --> 05:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
would so for the reason why we perform
 
05:18:10.788 --> 05:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
background checks uh fingerprinted
 
05:18:12.070 --> 05:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
background checks at the Department of
 
05:18:14.510 --> 05:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue is because um our employees have
 
05:18:17.190 --> 05:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
access to data that we receive from the
 
05:18:20.070 --> 05:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
IRS the IRS has a lot of regulations and
 
05:18:22.030 --> 05:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
rules as you can imagine around their
 
05:18:24.830 --> 05:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
data and so in order for me to allow an
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
employee to see IRS data I have to
 
05:18:31.430 --> 05:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
confirm um I have to perform a
 
05:18:33.670 --> 05:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted background check I have to
 
05:18:35.830 --> 05:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
do that upon employment and then I have
 
05:18:39.910 --> 05:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
to do that every 10 years so I think for
 
05:18:42.150 --> 05:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
our purposes even if there was a
 
05:18:44.830 --> 05:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
centralized check I think the IRS would
 
05:18:47.270 --> 05:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
likely still require that I perform it
 
05:18:49.830 --> 05:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
at employment and at the 10year Mark
 
05:18:51.548 --> 05:18:51.558 align:start position:0%
sure thank you thank
 
05:18:54.350 --> 05:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
you does anybody have any um questions
 
05:18:58.110 --> 05:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
for Miss stpp she's she's here okay if
 
05:18:59.830 --> 05:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
you if you don't mind we might need you
 
05:19:01.628 --> 05:19:01.638 align:start position:0%
to if you don't have any place to go if
 
05:19:03.190 --> 05:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
you wanted to stick around just in case
 
05:19:04.750 --> 05:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
a couple questions come up but if you do
 
05:19:06.750 --> 05:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
have to go we totally understand because
 
05:19:08.788 --> 05:19:08.798 align:start position:0%
we like having standby some sometimes we
 
05:19:11.830 --> 05:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
rails is is there anybody else here um
 
05:19:19.548 --> 05:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:21.390 --> 05:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
1197 oh you thought you were going to
 
05:19:27.110 --> 05:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:29.230 --> 05:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
there I think we all probably have three
 
05:19:31.270 --> 05:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
or four things in the fire right now
 
05:19:32.708 --> 05:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
kind of losing track where I'm mat to be
 
05:19:34.350 --> 05:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
honest with
 
05:19:38.990 --> 05:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:42.030 --> 05:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
bit there you go sorry my name is
 
05:19:43.788 --> 05:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
Christine Shay and I am the
 
05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
administrator of the criminal records
 
05:19:47.788 --> 05:19:47.798 align:start position:0%
unit which is within the State Police
 
05:19:50.910 --> 05:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and we are the unit
 
05:19:53.750 --> 05:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's actually directly in charge of
 
05:19:57.670 --> 05:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
the fingerprints within the state and we
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
worked very hard with representative Ms
 
05:20:00.718 --> 05:20:02.150 align:start position:0%
worked very hard with representative Ms
on

05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:20:03.868 --> 05:20:03.878 align:start position:0%
putting together what we thought would
 
05:20:06.788 --> 05:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
be the best for cleaning up the rsas
 
05:20:09.910 --> 05:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
across the board so they would all say
 
05:20:13.070 --> 05:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
the same thing and allow the flexibility
 
05:20:15.270 --> 05:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
well it's right now we're in a great
 
05:20:18.270 --> 05:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
spot with appointments it would allow
 
05:20:20.990 --> 05:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
that flexibility moving forward if
 
05:20:23.708 --> 05:20:23.718 align:start position:0%
something were to happen again like Co
 
05:20:26.910 --> 05:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
and executive orders so the language
 
05:20:30.270 --> 05:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
would be in place to enact that um as
 
05:20:32.110 --> 05:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
far as training that would be something
 
05:20:34.788 --> 05:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
we would be responsible for cuz we want
 
05:20:37.708 --> 05:20:37.718 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all the demographics
 
05:20:40.190 --> 05:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
everything that's collected is
 
05:20:43.070 --> 05:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
correct so that would be something we'll
 
05:20:47.708 --> 05:20:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.788 --> 05:20:49.798 align:start position:0%
on and I don't know if you can answer
 
05:20:51.708 --> 05:20:51.718 align:start position:0%
this but do I understand correctly that
 
05:20:53.350 --> 05:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
the education department is already
 
05:20:55.868 --> 05:20:55.878 align:start position:0%
doing this yes so they have the
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
authority that they can so a lot of
 
05:21:01.788 --> 05:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
superintendant will do Inc car or some
 
05:21:05.310 --> 05:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
of them do have live skin machines okay
 
05:21:08.350 --> 05:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
and how is that working out um it's
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
again a training thing that was enacted
 
05:21:15.310 --> 05:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
quite a while ago um where we do need to
 
05:21:16.910 --> 05:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
have more training and that's why we had
 
05:21:20.310 --> 05:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
the language in here per the department
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
of safety commissioner because that way
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
we can kind of oversee who is going to
 
05:21:28.750 --> 05:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
be taking those prints and we can ensure
 
05:21:30.628 --> 05:21:30.638 align:start position:0%
that we are physically the ones training
 
05:21:43.230 --> 05:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:46.230 --> 05:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
y representative Harry GTH did you have
 
05:21:51.430 --> 05:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay yes you may no I I would like to
 
05:21:58.030 --> 05:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
just um kind of follow up on on
 
05:21:59.868 --> 05:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
representative manion's question about
 
05:22:03.708 --> 05:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:08.310 --> 05:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
um I I met with um I met with the the
 
05:22:12.708 --> 05:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
individual in the um SAU for my town to
 
05:22:17.390 --> 05:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
talk about um you know this process and
 
05:22:21.230 --> 05:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
um and that's what got me interested in
 
05:22:24.548 --> 05:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
doing this bill
 
05:22:27.470 --> 05:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
um that
 
05:22:30.110 --> 05:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
there's I gu I would characterize this
 
05:22:33.670 --> 05:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
bill as kind of a first step in what I
 
05:22:36.390 --> 05:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
would what I hope will be a longer term
 
05:22:38.548 --> 05:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
process to try to automate and speed up
 
05:22:42.548 --> 05:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
the process the situation with the with
 
05:22:45.510 --> 05:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
in our in our seu I think is an example
 
05:22:48.510 --> 05:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
of what's happening around the state the
 
05:22:51.788 --> 05:22:51.798 align:start position:0%
the SAU um they took the initiative
 
05:22:56.070 --> 05:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
to um purchase equipment to capture
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
fingerprints electronically so they
 
05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
don't use ink
 
05:23:02.910 --> 05:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
anymore but because of the way the
 
05:23:05.190 --> 05:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
system is currently set up you know my
 
05:23:07.030 --> 05:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
first reaction was okay great you got
 
05:23:08.708 --> 05:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
the you got these now digital you should
 
05:23:11.948 --> 05:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
be able to just you know you know upload
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
it to a file send it in and it'll get
 
05:23:19.030 --> 05:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
approved um that's not what happens um
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
because um after talking with um you
 
05:23:24.548 --> 05:23:24.558 align:start position:0%
know the department of safety I think
 
05:23:27.070 --> 05:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
they I they may have purchased the wrong
 
05:23:29.788 --> 05:23:29.798 align:start position:0%
machine so what ends up happening now is
 
05:23:31.470 --> 05:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
they have this wonderful machine that
 
05:23:33.628 --> 05:23:33.638 align:start position:0%
captures fingerprints digitally they
 
05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
print out a car and they they type in
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
all the information on the demographics
 
05:23:40.310 --> 05:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
of the candidate um so it's all there
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
digitally and then they print off the
 
05:23:46.390 --> 05:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
card and then they mail the card to the
 
05:23:48.628 --> 05:23:48.638 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Safety the criminal
 
05:23:50.948 --> 05:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
records unit who then has to go in
 
05:23:53.670 --> 05:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
reenter the data and and process
 
05:23:57.390 --> 05:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
everything um so yes the Department of
 
05:24:00.070 --> 05:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
Education um school officials are
 
05:24:02.230 --> 05:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
authorized to collect the information
 
05:24:04.110 --> 05:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
and they're doing that but there's a lot
 
05:24:06.030 --> 05:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
of work that we still need to do to kind
 
05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
of make that work much smooth more
 
05:24:11.830 --> 05:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
smoothly and and in my testimony I I
 
05:24:13.990 --> 05:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
kind of mentioned that you know my
 
05:24:15.750 --> 05:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
initial thought was well that can't be
 
05:24:17.470 --> 05:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
that hard you know let's just upload it
 
05:24:19.470 --> 05:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
push a couple buttons b b bada boom bada
 
05:24:23.548 --> 05:24:23.558 align:start position:0%
bing done and it's not that easy and so
 
05:24:27.150 --> 05:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
my hope is that what what this task
 
05:24:31.430 --> 05:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
force can do is start
 
05:24:33.548 --> 05:24:33.558 align:start position:0%
identifying some of those additional
 
05:24:36.708 --> 05:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
steps that we need to take so that we
 
05:24:40.030 --> 05:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
can you know make that happen we should
 
05:24:42.750 --> 05:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
be able to make that happen U given the
 
05:24:45.510 --> 05:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
technology it just requires some work
 
05:24:49.230 --> 05:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to require some money um but
 
05:24:51.868 --> 05:24:51.878 align:start position:0%
um it's not something that we can do
 
05:24:54.110 --> 05:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
overnight and when I first started
 
05:24:56.910 --> 05:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
talking with the Department of Safety um
 
05:24:58.910 --> 05:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
after much prodding for me about no come
 
05:25:00.190 --> 05:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
on we got to be able to do more than
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
that come on got to be able to do more
 
05:25:05.110 --> 05:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
than that they kind of dug in and said
 
05:25:07.590 --> 05:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
no this is an important First Step that
 
05:25:11.070 --> 05:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
we need to do um and I I think I was
 
05:25:12.788 --> 05:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
maybe able to convince him that you know
 
05:25:14.230 --> 05:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay let's do that but let's also have
 
05:25:15.948 --> 05:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
this task force to start looking at this
 
05:25:18.270 --> 05:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
so that's so this it's a it's a much
 
05:25:24.270 --> 05:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:25.948 --> 05:25:25.958 align:start position:0%
hopefully so I've been in law
 
05:25:27.270 --> 05:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement for 30 years and I know when
 
05:25:29.350 --> 05:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
Department I worked at we went to
 
05:25:30.868 --> 05:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
basically just an inkless system system
 
05:25:32.910 --> 05:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
which is a Live Scan that prints the
 
05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
card out and we send it in we now have
 
05:25:37.548 --> 05:25:37.558 align:start position:0%
an aphis system which will is connected
 
05:25:40.230 --> 05:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
to the this the system if you will is
 
05:25:42.070 --> 05:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
that more what you're looking for like
 
05:25:43.230 --> 05:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
an apist type system where it's
 
05:25:45.230 --> 05:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
automatically sent through or just
 
05:25:50.030 --> 05:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
a so what happens currently with um you
 
05:25:51.948 --> 05:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
look at school districts they're not
 
05:25:55.510 --> 05:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to connect to our apis system
 
05:25:57.548 --> 05:25:57.558 align:start position:0%
because obviously there has to be a lot
 
05:26:00.948 --> 05:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
of Protections in order to do so and as
 
05:26:03.470 --> 05:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
Captain Mazy spoke about the other day
 
05:26:06.150 --> 05:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of one-way messaging to
 
05:26:08.910 --> 05:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that they're not able to tap in
 
05:26:11.150 --> 05:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
to the actual criminal side of the house
 
05:26:13.750 --> 05:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
because they're not authorized to do so
 
05:26:14.948 --> 05:26:14.958 align:start position:0%
only law
 
05:26:17.990 --> 05:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement um so when we say that's
 
05:26:19.868 --> 05:26:19.878 align:start position:0%
going to take time that's part of a
 
05:26:22.548 --> 05:26:22.558 align:start position:0%
bigger picture as far as getting that
 
05:26:24.910 --> 05:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
piece in there that we need to be able
 
05:26:29.350 --> 05:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
to do but it is an ays system um which
 
05:26:31.868 --> 05:26:31.878 align:start position:0%
you take the electronic fingerprints and
 
05:26:35.150 --> 05:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
on our side all we need is the tracking
 
05:26:37.350 --> 05:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
number the individual number for those
 
05:26:40.868 --> 05:26:40.878 align:start position:0%
prints and we can see it on our side
 
05:26:44.670 --> 05:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
without them having to send a card in
 
05:26:46.310 --> 05:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
the technology might be there the one
 
05:26:47.948 --> 05:26:47.958 align:start position:0%
way but you just have to implement that
 
05:26:49.948 --> 05:26:49.958 align:start position:0%
and make sure it's working correct
 
05:26:51.788 --> 05:26:51.798 align:start position:0%
correct and that's from law enforement
 
05:26:54.708 --> 05:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's working with our vendor
 
05:26:56.910 --> 05:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
um along with some other agencies just
 
05:26:59.390 --> 05:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
to ensure that those protections are in
 
05:27:07.990 --> 05:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:11.670 --> 05:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much thank you thank
 
05:27:13.110 --> 05:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
05:27:15.430 --> 05:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
you okay well there's nobody else out
 
05:27:15.440 --> 05:27:16.190 align:start position:0%
you okay well there's nobody else out
there

05:27:16.190 --> 05:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:27:19.788 --> 05:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
so um what do you guys
 
05:27:22.230 --> 05:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
think make a
 
05:27:25.030 --> 05:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
motion make a motion yeah sure let me
 
05:27:26.590 --> 05:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
just write that on here because Karen's
 
05:27:28.390 --> 05:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
going to be I don't have the exact form
 
05:27:29.628 --> 05:27:29.638 align:start position:0%
she was going to bring it but if I put
 
05:27:31.190 --> 05:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
it here I can trans transer whenever I
 
05:27:32.990 --> 05:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
get the exact
 
05:27:34.990 --> 05:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
form representative Muse you're
 
05:27:37.270 --> 05:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
recognized make motion I would like to
 
05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh move a recommendation for um uh
 
05:27:43.110 --> 05:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
approving Amendment
 
05:27:49.150 --> 05:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
2024 0597 H I'll second that
 
05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:01.310 --> 05:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
05978 okay so the motion is um a to pass
 
05:28:30.750 --> 05:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:33.510 --> 05:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh by moving uh the effective date uh
 
05:28:36.030 --> 05:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
out it seems to have addressed uh some
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
of the concerns around uh resource
 
05:28:40.070 --> 05:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
issues in New Hampshire we always have
 
05:28:42.990 --> 05:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
concerns around resource issues um but I
 
05:28:45.868 --> 05:28:45.878 align:start position:0%
think the combination of the task force
 
05:28:49.150 --> 05:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
uh to really uh Focus uh and prioritize
 
05:28:52.430 --> 05:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
on on next steps within the agencies and
 
05:28:55.590 --> 05:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
um actually not having to uh to actually
 
05:28:58.110 --> 05:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
do a lot of the implementation for this
 
05:29:01.110 --> 05:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh in this in the current fiscal year um
 
05:29:04.070 --> 05:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
is really a good compromise that uh you
 
05:29:06.910 --> 05:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
know that allows us to move forward uh
 
05:29:08.670 --> 05:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
with what sounds like our our much
 
05:29:10.670 --> 05:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
needed changes that are going to provide
 
05:29:12.030 --> 05:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
a lot more flexibility for the
 
05:29:13.868 --> 05:29:13.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety as well as other
 
05:29:15.868 --> 05:29:15.878 align:start position:0%
departments uh when it comes to this
 
05:29:19.030 --> 05:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
issue so um I think that this is uh this
 
05:29:20.990 --> 05:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
is a really good change a really good
 
05:29:25.150 --> 05:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment and uh um I'm happy to have uh
 
05:29:27.150 --> 05:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
put my name on it uh right under
 
05:29:27.160 --> 05:29:28.910 align:start position:0%
put my name on it uh right under
representative

05:29:28.910 --> 05:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:29:31.310 --> 05:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
Ms very well well said representative
 
05:29:32.948 --> 05:29:32.958 align:start position:0%
Manion do you have anything to say I
 
05:29:34.190 --> 05:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
agree with everything representative
 
05:29:37.590 --> 05:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
Muse just said uh representative Newman
 
05:29:40.270 --> 05:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
can you
 
05:29:44.390 --> 05:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
please I'm sorry it's okay go ahead um I
 
05:29:45.868 --> 05:29:45.878 align:start position:0%
think the amendment addresses all the
 
05:29:48.350 --> 05:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
concerns that I heard during the uh
 
05:29:51.910 --> 05:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
first hearing so um I think this is the
 
05:29:54.350 --> 05:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:57.150 --> 05:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
go all right sounds good uh
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
representative Newman did you have
 
05:30:00.990 --> 05:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
anything to say no I don't and I
 
05:30:03.430 --> 05:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
apologize somebody gave me a phone to
 
05:30:04.750 --> 05:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
plug in
 
05:30:09.030 --> 05:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
and okay so uh we don't have a clerk
 
05:30:12.350 --> 05:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
right so we can just just call this I

bill which I believe everyone in the
 
05:39:56.548 --> 05:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:58.910 --> 05:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
correct this basically uh addresses some
 
05:40:00.548 --> 05:40:00.558 align:start position:0%
of the issues with the returning of
 
05:40:04.310 --> 05:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
firearms for both uh domestic related

173b and 633 3A orders in addition to
 
05:40:10.510 --> 05:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
other circumstances may have resulted in

Firearms being seized by law
 
05:40:15.910 --> 05:40:15.920 align:start position:0%

okay we'll put him on the spot that way
 
05:41:16.150 --> 05:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's better coming from

05:41:20.910 --> 05:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:20.920 --> 05:41:26.190 align:start position:0%
 
do

05:41:26.190 --> 05:41:26.200 align:start position:0%

yeah thank you very much Captain yes
 
05:41:29.670 --> 05:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the
 
05:41:31.390 --> 05:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um again my name is Victor
 
05:41:34.150 --> 05:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
Muzzy Captain with the uh State Police
 
05:41:35.430 --> 05:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
in charge of the Justice information
 
05:41:37.110 --> 05:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
Bureau in and happen to oversee the
 
05:41:39.468 --> 05:41:39.478 align:start position:0%
gunline um relative to the amendment I
 
05:41:41.510 --> 05:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
think the state police is our position
 
05:41:44.070 --> 05:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
on the bill would be neutral um as a
 
05:41:47.230 --> 05:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
matter of practical application on uh
 
05:41:47.240 --> 05:41:48.510 align:start position:0%
matter of practical application on uh
lines

05:41:48.510 --> 05:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:41:52.230 --> 05:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
30 really I'll say from lines 28 to 31
 
05:41:56.990 --> 05:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:00.110 --> 05:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
um my thoughts on on that from a again a
 
05:42:02.468 --> 05:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
practical application in my experience
 
05:42:07.030 --> 05:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
with the courts is um often times when
 
05:42:09.750 --> 05:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh when a check what gets referred to as
 
05:42:12.670 --> 05:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
a NYX check um oftentimes that check for
 
05:42:14.548 --> 05:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
us is is checking several things of
 
05:42:16.948 --> 05:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
which the Nyx indices um is one of those
 
05:42:20.788 --> 05:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
checks and oftentimes um we may require
 
05:42:22.990 --> 05:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
further followup or further research or
 
05:42:26.030 --> 05:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
further investigation with what we found
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
um from that initial
 
05:42:31.350 --> 05:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
inquiry in in most cases 10 business
 
05:42:34.230 --> 05:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
days is reasonable um I think the issue
 
05:42:36.350 --> 05:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
or the the possible practical
 
05:42:38.910 --> 05:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
application or technical issue here is
 
05:42:40.990 --> 05:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
on line 31 where it says the department
 
05:42:43.230 --> 05:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
of safety lines 30 and 31 the department
 
05:42:45.310 --> 05:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
of safety shall provide a proceed
 
05:42:47.948 --> 05:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
response to the requesting Court um and
 
05:42:50.230 --> 05:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's a result of if the NX check is
 
05:42:51.868 --> 05:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
inconclusive and the department of
 
05:42:53.788 --> 05:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
safety cannot explicitly demonstrate
 
05:42:56.310 --> 05:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
that the individual is prohibited in my
 
05:42:58.628 --> 05:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
mind those words mean we've we have a
 
05:43:01.948 --> 05:43:01.958 align:start position:0%
definitive answer um and so what this
 
05:43:04.190 --> 05:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
says to me is if it's not
 
05:43:06.350 --> 05:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
definitive uh then the answer has to be
 
05:43:07.830 --> 05:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
yes and that's a little concerning
 
05:43:09.270 --> 05:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
because there may be some information
 
05:43:11.788 --> 05:43:11.798 align:start position:0%
that the judges should take into
 
05:43:14.310 --> 05:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
consideration um when they're making a
 
05:43:15.868 --> 05:43:15.878 align:start position:0%
determination or having a hearing on the
 
05:43:19.750 --> 05:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
matter and so if if shall was changed to
 
05:43:22.910 --> 05:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
May that would allow us to uh provide
 
05:43:25.310 --> 05:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
what information we do have for the
 
05:43:27.670 --> 05:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
judges consideration because my fear
 
05:43:29.670 --> 05:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
again judges being judges the law says
 
05:43:32.030 --> 05:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
shall I'm only speculating that they're
 
05:43:33.788 --> 05:43:33.798 align:start position:0%
if they get a letter from me because
 
05:43:35.510 --> 05:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
I've had to provide a letter that says
 
05:43:37.548 --> 05:43:37.558 align:start position:0%
proceed then they're going to assume
 
05:43:38.788 --> 05:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
that if it's not a red light it's a
 
05:43:40.070 --> 05:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
green light well it might be a yellow
 
05:43:42.070 --> 05:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
light and I guess changing one word from
 
05:43:48.270 --> 05:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:51.030 --> 05:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
versus as I read this now again if it's
 
05:43:52.788 --> 05:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
not a no it's a yes well it might be a
 
05:43:54.788 --> 05:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
maybe and I just would like the judge to
 
05:43:56.868 --> 05:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
take that maybe into consideration and I
 
05:43:58.270 --> 05:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
think with that one word change that
 
05:44:01.190 --> 05:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
that is possibility currently the way
 
05:44:02.390 --> 05:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's written I don't believe that would
 
05:44:03.670 --> 05:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
be a
 
05:44:06.590 --> 05:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
possibility thank you Captain uh anyone
 
05:44:10.548 --> 05:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:13.430 --> 05:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
captain could you uh give some oversight
 
05:44:15.430 --> 05:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
to how it's currently done for the
 
05:44:16.910 --> 05:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
returning of firearms and we'll use the
 
05:44:19.070 --> 05:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
example of a 173b
 
05:44:21.868 --> 05:44:21.878 align:start position:0%
situation to use that as an example step
 
05:44:23.150 --> 05:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
walk us through the steps of how an
 
05:44:24.948 --> 05:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
individual would get their firearms back
 
05:44:27.990 --> 05:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
if they're in state police custody yep
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:44:32.390 --> 05:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
I I can speak to the gunline portion of
 
05:44:34.948 --> 05:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
that and and the check that is performed
 
05:44:36.390 --> 05:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
is the exact same check as when you're
 
05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
purchasing a firearm um as far as the
 
05:44:40.590 --> 05:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
databases that are queried and the check
 
05:44:42.948 --> 05:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
that is done everyone refers to it as a
 
05:44:45.548 --> 05:44:45.558 align:start position:0%
NYX check NYX is one of the indices that
 
05:44:47.190 --> 05:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
we check there's several others for
 
05:44:49.510 --> 05:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
various things that may be prohibitors
 
05:44:50.948 --> 05:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
or may may rise to the level of a
 
05:44:53.390 --> 05:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
Prohibition so for all intents and
 
05:44:56.350 --> 05:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
purposes the the check itself is done
 
05:44:57.708 --> 05:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
exactly the same way as it would be if
 
05:44:59.590 --> 05:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
you were purchasing a firearm as as it
 
05:45:02.628 --> 05:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
is for returning of firearms um if that
 
05:45:04.350 --> 05:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
answers the question could you just tell
 
05:45:06.548 --> 05:45:06.558 align:start position:0%
the committee who actually oversees the
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
operations of
 
05:45:10.868 --> 05:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
Nicks uh Lieutenant Mary Bia is the
 
05:45:13.030 --> 05:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
direct supervisor and I'm the captain
 
05:45:14.628 --> 05:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
over the lieuten I was referring to the
 
05:45:16.990 --> 05:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
actual agency oh I'm sorry the FBI thank
 
05:45:18.788 --> 05:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
you the FBI are there any additional
 
05:45:20.350 --> 05:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
checks that are done through the New
 
05:45:22.190 --> 05:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gun line through the
 
05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
department of safety other than
 
05:45:27.750 --> 05:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
Nicks well we check everything I guess
 
05:45:29.190 --> 05:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
and what I mean by that is we do a
 
05:45:30.430 --> 05:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
driver's license check in the first
 
05:45:31.670 --> 05:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
instance to make sure that that is a
 
05:45:33.510 --> 05:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
valid credential that's been provided
 
05:45:34.910 --> 05:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
typically that's in the confines of an
 
05:45:37.708 --> 05:45:37.718 align:start position:0%
FFL if we're getting Court documentation
 
05:45:41.150 --> 05:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
that that's that's obviously um noting
 
05:45:42.830 --> 05:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
the subject's name and date of birth and
 
05:45:44.230 --> 05:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
things we're taking that as the official
 
05:45:46.030 --> 05:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
documentation so we're not necessarily
 
05:45:47.430 --> 05:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
doing a license check in that particular
 
05:45:49.270 --> 05:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
instance but we're checking triple I
 
05:45:50.830 --> 05:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
we're checking the instate wanted files
 
05:45:52.350 --> 05:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
we're checking uh
 
05:45:56.468 --> 05:45:56.478 align:start position:0%
ncks um and our protection order
 
05:45:59.190 --> 05:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
files that we get on a daily basis so
 
05:46:00.670 --> 05:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
there's several things that we're
 
05:46:02.310 --> 05:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
looking at to come to an overall
 
05:46:05.110 --> 05:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
determination it's not just the Nicks
 
05:46:08.270 --> 05:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
indices that makes sense thank you does
 
05:46:10.910 --> 05:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions yet on the
 
05:46:12.350 --> 05:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
procedure on how it's currently being
 
05:46:15.670 --> 05:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:18.468 --> 05:46:18.478 align:start position:0%
property representative Muse what what
 
05:46:20.590 --> 05:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
is the role of the local agency who may
 
05:46:23.310 --> 05:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
have act who may actually have the uh uh
 
05:46:25.670 --> 05:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
the weapons currently stored yeah and so
 
05:46:27.670 --> 05:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
I can't what I can speak to is typically
 
05:46:29.468 --> 05:46:29.478 align:start position:0%
the state police unless unless it's our
 
05:46:32.310 --> 05:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
criminal case the State Police gun line
 
05:46:33.990 --> 05:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
typically does return of firearms
 
05:46:36.830 --> 05:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
pursuant to superior court orders um and
 
05:46:39.070 --> 05:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
so I can't speak to the process that a
 
05:46:42.868 --> 05:46:42.878 align:start position:0%
local agency uh employs for the purpose
 
05:46:46.468 --> 05:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
of returning Firearms
 
05:46:50.510 --> 05:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess I can't speak to that this
 
05:46:52.628 --> 05:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
bill though it or this this amendment
 
05:46:55.430 --> 05:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
would actually apply uh just to the
 
05:46:57.548 --> 05:46:57.558 align:start position:0%
state police in for return of firearm
 
05:46:59.430 --> 05:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
situations or would it also apply to
 
05:47:01.190 --> 05:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
local agencies as well I think it would
 
05:47:02.948 --> 05:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
apply to local agencies that would end
 
05:47:04.830 --> 05:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
up coming through the state police so
 
05:47:06.868 --> 05:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
it's really going to apply to everybody
 
05:47:08.468 --> 05:47:08.478 align:start position:0%
the language in here certainly has a
 
05:47:10.310 --> 05:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
couple of mandates for the Department of
 
05:47:11.868 --> 05:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
Safety and and
 
05:47:15.030 --> 05:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm not I was not I I worked for a
 
05:47:16.590 --> 05:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
local agency before I came on the state
 
05:47:18.230 --> 05:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
police 19 years ago and I I don't know
 
05:47:20.270 --> 05:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
that I was ever involved in the process
 
05:47:22.948 --> 05:47:22.958 align:start position:0%
uh at a at a while at that local agency
 
05:47:25.270 --> 05:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
for return of firearms
 
05:47:28.350 --> 05:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
but I suspect the process is similar and
 
05:47:30.430 --> 05:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
often times the gun line you know my gun
 
05:47:33.030 --> 05:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
line becomes a resource for the local
 
05:47:34.190 --> 05:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
departments when they have a question
 
05:47:36.670 --> 05:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
about a record or an out ofate record or
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
something like that they may be looking
 
05:47:39.510 --> 05:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
at to help determinate you know make the
 
05:47:41.990 --> 05:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
determination as to what that record is
 
05:47:42.000 --> 05:47:44.390 align:start position:0%
determination as to what that record is
telling

05:47:44.390 --> 05:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:47.468 --> 05:47:47.478 align:start position:0%
them and one one more question that I
 
05:47:51.990 --> 05:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
have the the the 10 days that seem to be
 
05:47:54.750 --> 05:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
set up as a deadline for receiving uh
 
05:48:02.468 --> 05:48:02.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:06.030 --> 05:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
um what this basically seems to be
 
05:48:09.390 --> 05:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
saying is that if the information is is
 
05:48:11.548 --> 05:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
inconclusive essentially if
 
05:48:14.150 --> 05:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
you what it what it seems to do is it
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
seems to authorize returning of the
 
05:48:19.150 --> 05:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
returning of weapons potentially in a
 
05:48:22.030 --> 05:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
situation where you're still not quite
 
05:48:25.868 --> 05:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
sure if this individual um is okay to
 
05:48:27.868 --> 05:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
return weapons to is that that that
 
05:48:30.310 --> 05:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
that's my reading of it uh is that the
 
05:48:32.948 --> 05:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
way you read it as well it is and I
 
05:48:34.670 --> 05:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
think in the interest of due process you
 
05:48:37.030 --> 05:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
have to put a time limit on it and so I
 
05:48:39.390 --> 05:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not so concerned about the 10 days
 
05:48:41.030 --> 05:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
because in all honesty in from a
 
05:48:43.510 --> 05:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
practical standpoint in most cases we
 
05:48:45.190 --> 05:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
probably can get that answer within 10
 
05:48:48.708 --> 05:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
days a definitive yes or no
 
05:48:51.350 --> 05:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
um so but there are instances certainly
 
05:48:53.150 --> 05:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
where we can't and most of those
 
05:48:54.830 --> 05:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
instances where we can't is because
 
05:48:59.150 --> 05:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
we're relying on another state um to get
 
05:49:00.350 --> 05:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
in some cases and they're just
 
05:49:02.990 --> 05:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
non-responsive and we have no authority
 
05:49:04.788 --> 05:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
over them to mandate a response we try
 
05:49:07.750 --> 05:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
to flag it and make it
 
05:49:10.868 --> 05:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
uh you know a priority getting their
 
05:49:10.878 --> 05:49:12.270 align:start position:0%
uh you know a priority getting their
attention

05:49:12.270 --> 05:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
attention
 
05:49:14.910 --> 05:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
but so that's the concern I think again
 
05:49:17.390 --> 05:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
in 90% of cases 10 days is probably long
 
05:49:18.868 --> 05:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
enough to make a determination and in
 
05:49:20.948 --> 05:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
the interest of due process and and and
 
05:49:23.110 --> 05:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know Speedy due process the 10 days
 
05:49:26.948 --> 05:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
seems reasonable it's really more what I
 
05:49:28.548 --> 05:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
perceive to be the issue with the judges
 
05:49:30.628 --> 05:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
is if they get a shall proceed from us
 
05:49:32.910 --> 05:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
we're the state police so we must know
 
05:49:34.590 --> 05:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
this thing says shall proceed because
 
05:49:37.030 --> 05:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
this particular bill says so or RSA
 
05:49:39.628 --> 05:49:39.638 align:start position:0%
eventually says so um really what I'm
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
trying to say to I think to illustrate
 
05:49:43.230 --> 05:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
what you're asking is let me just
 
05:49:45.150 --> 05:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
provide what I have to the judge and the
 
05:49:47.468 --> 05:49:47.478 align:start position:0%
judge can make a a determination and
 
05:49:49.750 --> 05:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
what I do provide may be inconclusive
 
05:49:52.070 --> 05:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
but at least that the judge has got some
 
05:49:54.670 --> 05:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
more information rather than a simple
 
05:49:57.628 --> 05:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
proceed so this to me reads that well if
 
05:50:00.190 --> 05:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
it's if it's not a red light it's a
 
05:50:03.910 --> 05:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
green light and so um but it may not
 
05:50:06.310 --> 05:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily you know be a green light we
 
05:50:08.750 --> 05:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
just haven't gotten to the red light yet
 
05:50:11.110 --> 05:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's like stuck at
 
05:50:14.708 --> 05:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
yellow does this seem to be the the kind
 
05:50:16.990 --> 05:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
of situation where you would require a
 
05:50:20.110 --> 05:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
court hearing rather than just issuing a
 
05:50:23.110 --> 05:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
a proceed order I think it's probably a
 
05:50:24.708 --> 05:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
good idea I think the intent is that
 
05:50:26.628 --> 05:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
that would happen anyway as I understand
 
05:50:28.868 --> 05:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
it that the police department would get
 
05:50:30.910 --> 05:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
notified of the hearing and could it
 
05:50:32.190 --> 05:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
could appear at that hearing if there
 
05:50:34.548 --> 05:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
were a question um I just want to make
 
05:50:36.430 --> 05:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
sure that the law would allow for that
 
05:50:40.070 --> 05:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
process to happen um versus everyone's
 
05:50:42.468 --> 05:50:42.478 align:start position:0%
busy everyone's doing a million things
 
05:50:43.948 --> 05:50:43.958 align:start position:0%
the court you know I I Envision the
 
05:50:45.590 --> 05:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
clerk of court slipping a piece of paper
 
05:50:47.868 --> 05:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
into the judge into the file that says
 
05:50:49.190 --> 05:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
we've got a proceed letter from the
 
05:50:52.430 --> 05:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
state police on this and and you know
 
05:50:54.430 --> 05:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
while we could in that instance you know
 
05:50:56.350 --> 05:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
provide that follow-up information is
 
05:50:59.070 --> 05:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
the judge going to look at that where
 
05:51:01.310 --> 05:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
this would potentially say shall provide
 
05:51:04.190 --> 05:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
a proceed letter I realize this this the
 
05:51:05.670 --> 05:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is to put us light
 
05:51:07.190 --> 05:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
years ahead of where we currently are I
 
05:51:10.270 --> 05:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
just don't want to create situation
 
05:51:13.310 --> 05:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
where we're not allowing for
 
05:51:16.230 --> 05:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
that which would the May would alleviate
 
05:51:17.910 --> 05:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
that I believe the May is a step in the
 
05:51:20.150 --> 05:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
right direction in helping alleviate
 
05:51:23.310 --> 05:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
that yes thank you representative gathri
 
05:51:27.150 --> 05:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
so um I understand the 10 what's
 
05:51:30.868 --> 05:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
happening now like before this bill what
 
05:51:33.910 --> 05:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
are we doing five day or 30day there
 
05:51:36.150 --> 05:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
there is no time frame on it I think
 
05:51:37.868 --> 05:51:37.878 align:start position:0%
depending upon when the hearing may be
 
05:51:39.750 --> 05:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
and other things we are being again
 
05:51:40.990 --> 05:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
we're being asked I think from the
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
Superior Court standpoint and we do a
 
05:51:46.150 --> 05:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
check and provide whatever results we
 
05:51:48.750 --> 05:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
have back we have a form that I think we
 
05:51:50.670 --> 05:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
fax back to the clerk of court that
 
05:51:52.390 --> 05:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
tells us basically the results of of
 
05:51:54.390 --> 05:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
that particular check if it's not a
 
05:51:56.590 --> 05:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
superior court um that's reaching out
 
05:51:58.390 --> 05:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
then I that I believe the local police
 
05:52:01.670 --> 05:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
are handling that at their level not on
 
05:52:04.990 --> 05:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:11.310 --> 05:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:13.628 --> 05:52:13.638 align:start position:0%
question uh Chief Goldstein would you
 
05:52:15.910 --> 05:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
like to speak to the uh local uh
 
05:52:19.708 --> 05:52:19.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:22.510 --> 05:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
currently come on down sir thank
 
05:52:26.708 --> 05:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:28.868 --> 05:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
Captain for the record
 
05:52:30.628 --> 05:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
uh David Goldstein chief of police city
 
05:52:33.628 --> 05:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
of Franklin been a police officer for 44
 
05:52:36.750 --> 05:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
years um everything the captain said is
 
05:52:40.510 --> 05:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
correct I ditto uh concise aidite and um
 
05:52:45.830 --> 05:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
on point uh our concern here is that uh
 
05:52:49.190 --> 05:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
what's happening is this the sh if it
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
were a May would go toward what we would
 
05:52:54.350 --> 05:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
be able to work with a little bit more
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
comfortably um the way that this is
 
05:52:59.468 --> 05:52:59.478 align:start position:0%
written it puts the onus on the state
 
05:53:01.750 --> 05:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
police to generate the information but
 
05:53:03.708 --> 05:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
then that information has to come to me
 
05:53:06.390 --> 05:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
or whomever I delegate to take care of
 
05:53:07.830 --> 05:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
that in this case it would probably be
 
05:53:09.670 --> 05:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
my prosecutor and my legal
 
05:53:14.628 --> 05:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
secretary um a 10day um a 10day uh time
 
05:53:17.270 --> 05:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
frame or 10 business days really works
 
05:53:20.548 --> 05:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
out to about two weeks give or take uh
 
05:53:24.270 --> 05:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
but again uh I've seen in the past in my
 
05:53:26.750 --> 05:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
experience um when I for example might
 
05:53:28.670 --> 05:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
deny a uh firearm
 
05:53:31.750 --> 05:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh licensed to carry in the old days uh
 
05:53:33.670 --> 05:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
it could take more than a few days to
 
05:53:37.590 --> 05:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
get before a judge um I think the J the
 
05:53:40.868 --> 05:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
Judiciary would have to um be trained in
 
05:53:43.948 --> 05:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
this as well uh because Franklin for
 
05:53:45.310 --> 05:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
example would be going to Franklin
 
05:53:47.390 --> 05:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
circuit court and we'd be asking the
 
05:53:49.948 --> 05:53:49.958 align:start position:0%
judge to make a decision uh that he or
 
05:53:51.948 --> 05:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
she might not be ready to make at that
 
05:53:53.868 --> 05:53:53.878 align:start position:0%
point but it does fall to them the
 
05:53:57.030 --> 05:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
Judiciary to do that um they are as
 
05:53:58.708 --> 05:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
strapped for
 
05:54:00.868 --> 05:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
individuals as much as the rest of us
 
05:54:03.628 --> 05:54:03.638 align:start position:0%
are from a local point of view um the
 
05:54:05.750 --> 05:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
state police is doing us a service by
 
05:54:08.270 --> 05:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
generating the information that we need
 
05:54:10.310 --> 05:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
but my question then becomes between
 
05:54:12.948 --> 05:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
that time and when I'm ready to go to
 
05:54:15.390 --> 05:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
court is anything else happen so our
 
05:54:18.430 --> 05:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
process would be not only a ncks check
 
05:54:20.468 --> 05:54:20.478 align:start position:0%
but a local records check to make sure
 
05:54:22.708 --> 05:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
that the individual hadn't engaged in in
 
05:54:24.990 --> 05:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
prohibitive Behavior between point a and
 
05:54:29.030 --> 05:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
point B if that makes sense um so
 
05:54:31.670 --> 05:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
again the uh as the amendment or
 
05:54:33.788 --> 05:54:33.798 align:start position:0%
amending this to May versus shell would
 
05:54:37.030 --> 05:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
help us uh as well so I can answer
 
05:54:38.548 --> 05:54:38.558 align:start position:0%
questions for and chief you're aware
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
that uh this is a court proceeding that
 
05:54:42.310 --> 05:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
would be generated so that an individual
 
05:54:44.310 --> 05:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
filing a motion would have to go to
 
05:54:45.830 --> 05:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
court have a hearing date and all
 
05:54:48.150 --> 05:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
parties would be noticed as typical
 
05:54:50.750 --> 05:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
exactly and and to be quite Frank how
 
05:54:52.830 --> 05:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
many times have we seen
 
05:54:55.150 --> 05:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
someone subpoena to court or given a
 
05:54:56.468 --> 05:54:56.478 align:start position:0%
notice of a court date and then for
 
05:54:58.910 --> 05:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
whatever reason that has to be continued
 
05:55:02.350 --> 05:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
and continued and continued again uh for
 
05:55:04.390 --> 05:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
example in juvenile law there are very
 
05:55:07.990 --> 05:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
very specific time frames and even there
 
05:55:09.990 --> 05:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
cases can be continued as long as both
 
05:55:12.548 --> 05:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
parties agree so this is something that
 
05:55:15.948 --> 05:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
while certainly uh a Herculean attempt
 
05:55:18.150 --> 05:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
to try to fix an a problem that may
 
05:55:20.708 --> 05:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
exist uh and a legitimate attempt we
 
05:55:22.788 --> 05:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
still have to consider the reality of
 
05:55:26.430 --> 05:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
the situation that 10 days may work 10
 
05:55:28.110 --> 05:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
business days may work and is the cap
 
05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
and said 90% of the time sure sure that
 
05:55:32.670 --> 05:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
probably is true but what about the
 
05:55:35.110 --> 05:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
other 10% of the
 
05:55:38.110 --> 05:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
time anybody have any questions for the
 
05:55:42.230 --> 05:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
chief the question is yes right now
 
05:55:45.990 --> 05:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
today usually how long would it take
 
05:55:49.070 --> 05:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's 10 days on this um in this
 
05:55:51.788 --> 05:55:51.798 align:start position:0%
amendment again it would depend on it we
 
05:55:53.430 --> 05:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
try to get the guns we don't want the
 
05:55:54.788 --> 05:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
guns I'm going to be quite Frank with
 
05:55:58.350 --> 05:55:58.360 align:start position:0%
you we do not want them and I would uh I
 
05:56:00.350 --> 05:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
think I can State uh somewhat
 
05:56:02.150 --> 05:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
unequivocally that my colleagues don't
 
05:56:04.070 --> 05:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
want to store the guns either that's not
 
05:56:07.110 --> 05:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
our business um so we will make this
 
05:56:09.910 --> 05:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
happen as quickly as possible uh if we
 
05:56:11.590 --> 05:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
need to do another NYX check to give the
 
05:56:14.830 --> 05:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
guns back that's only a couple of days
 
05:56:21.510 --> 05:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:23.990 --> 05:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
part he's saying it's a couple days why
 
05:56:27.270 --> 05:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
are we to 10 that's if he you're going
 
05:56:28.788 --> 05:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
through the local AG agency if you go
 
05:56:30.270 --> 05:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
through a court to request a court
 
05:56:32.868 --> 05:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
hearing they actually have to notice all
 
05:56:34.390 --> 05:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
parties involved so that the hearing is
 
05:56:36.510 --> 05:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
pushed out for the hearing day it gives
 
05:56:38.070 --> 05:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity if and correct me if I'm
 
05:56:38.910 --> 05:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
wrong Chief but it would give the
 
05:56:41.548 --> 05:56:41.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the uh say in a 173b
 
05:56:43.830 --> 05:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
case for an example the uh the victim
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
could be noticed then you would have the
 
05:56:47.910 --> 05:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh resting or not resting agency but the
 
05:56:49.830 --> 05:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh law local law enforcement agency
 
05:56:50.948 --> 05:56:50.958 align:start position:0%
would be noticed so that they could go
 
05:56:52.070 --> 05:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
speak of the hearing if they have an
 
05:56:54.350 --> 05:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
issue so all parties would be noticed of
 
05:56:55.948 --> 05:56:55.958 align:start position:0%
the hearing date if no one shows up
 
05:56:57.990 --> 05:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
except for the defendant then that's
 
05:56:59.190 --> 05:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
obviously going to make for a short
 
05:57:01.230 --> 05:57:01.240 align:start position:0%
hearing and per perhaps I wasn't clear
 
05:57:03.910 --> 05:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
and I apologize so what might happen is
 
05:57:06.230 --> 05:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh you would like your guns back now you
 
05:57:08.150 --> 05:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
come to me and say I want my guns back
 
05:57:10.430 --> 05:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
and my prosecutor will say you've got to
 
05:57:12.830 --> 05:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
go to court get the court order and
 
05:57:14.788 --> 05:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
we'll give you your guns back no problem
 
05:57:16.830 --> 05:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
as long as everything is is the way that
 
05:57:18.510 --> 05:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
it should be that's when it would only
 
05:57:19.990 --> 05:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
take a short period of time because then
 
05:57:21.948 --> 05:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
I've got a piece of paper from the court
 
05:57:23.628 --> 05:57:23.638 align:start position:0%
that says it's okay to give the guns
 
05:57:25.468 --> 05:57:25.478 align:start position:0%
back that
 
05:57:28.468 --> 05:57:28.478 align:start position:0%
simple so you have followup yeah go
 
05:57:32.310 --> 05:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
ahead so with that said so in in this
 
05:57:34.670 --> 05:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
bill we're gonna we're not going to be
 
05:57:36.468 --> 05:57:36.478 align:start position:0%
doing that because he's
 
05:57:39.390 --> 05:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
no he's still no there's there's still
 
05:57:40.750 --> 05:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
it's still an Avenue the only thing this
 
05:57:42.670 --> 05:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
bill really does as a practical matter
 
05:57:45.110 --> 05:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
is at a 10day window to the court
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
correct so there's still background
 
05:57:48.150 --> 05:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
checks being done it's the law
 
05:57:49.868 --> 05:57:49.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement communicated to me that I
 
05:57:53.110 --> 05:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
spoke with when working on the bill and
 
05:57:55.548 --> 05:57:55.558 align:start position:0%
with Tim MCU is that it was imperative
 
05:57:57.830 --> 05:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
that they had a court document that
 
05:57:59.868 --> 05:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
showed the due process for the returning
 
05:58:01.868 --> 05:58:01.878 align:start position:0%
of firearms that they could put either
 
05:58:04.150 --> 05:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
electronically or in a hard file so that
 
05:58:05.948 --> 05:58:05.958 align:start position:0%
there was any further issues they said
 
05:58:07.628 --> 05:58:07.638 align:start position:0%
hey here's here's the judge's order that
 
05:58:10.070 --> 05:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
said we had to return the Firearms so
 
05:58:11.868 --> 05:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
the due process would be there to return
 
05:58:13.990 --> 05:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
Firearms it would not be immediate it
 
05:58:16.110 --> 05:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
would be the 10day hearing it is frames
 
05:58:17.670 --> 05:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
in the work for that the guard reils for
 
05:58:19.310 --> 05:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
the court would have the 10 days to hold
 
05:58:21.910 --> 05:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing and as uh we've heard
 
05:58:23.868 --> 05:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
testimony it's not uncommon for a judge
 
05:58:25.390 --> 05:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
that if he's not satisfied what he has
 
05:58:27.708 --> 05:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
for information to continue that hearing
 
05:58:29.788 --> 05:58:29.798 align:start position:0%
until he receives the uh documentation
 
05:58:31.708 --> 05:58:31.718 align:start position:0%
he wants uh one of the issues that has
 
05:58:33.468 --> 05:58:33.478 align:start position:0%
been brought up and I don't know if the
 
05:58:34.750 --> 05:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
chief would like to respond to it or
 
05:58:36.788 --> 05:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
maybe the captain but there are times
 
05:58:38.548 --> 05:58:38.558 align:start position:0%
under Nicks when a check is done and
 
05:58:39.868 --> 05:58:39.878 align:start position:0%
they reach out to another state that
 
05:58:41.708 --> 05:58:41.718 align:start position:0%
they may never receive a response from
 
05:58:43.270 --> 05:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
that state which you really have to
 
05:58:45.708 --> 05:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
balance out individual uh rights to
 
05:58:47.708 --> 05:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
property versus uh government
 
05:58:50.430 --> 05:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
inefficiency or neglect I would
 
05:58:53.230 --> 05:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
agree yeah and I I I would agree and
 
05:58:54.830 --> 05:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
that was the concern here is that often
 
05:58:57.030 --> 05:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
times if it's a state issue then we can
 
05:58:58.468 --> 05:58:58.478 align:start position:0%
get that answer because we have local
 
05:59:00.150 --> 05:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
people that we can reach out to if I'm
 
05:59:02.030 --> 05:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
reaching out to Nevada some other state
 
05:59:03.350 --> 05:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
that is like oh yeah we'll get to you
 
05:59:05.070 --> 05:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
and whenever and that's to the point of
 
05:59:06.868 --> 05:59:06.878 align:start position:0%
the due processes we have to put a time
 
05:59:08.548 --> 05:59:08.558 align:start position:0%
frame on it I just want to make sure
 
05:59:09.948 --> 05:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
that whatever we have within that time
 
05:59:11.190 --> 05:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
frame we're able to provide the judge
 
05:59:13.070 --> 05:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
with that information to either then
 
05:59:14.868 --> 05:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
continue it to allow for that additional
 
05:59:16.390 --> 05:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
time or to say Okay I I don't think
 
05:59:17.868 --> 05:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
there's anything of concern there based
 
05:59:19.468 --> 05:59:19.478 align:start position:0%
upon X Y and Z and and we're going to
 
05:59:21.310 --> 05:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to return the Firearms I I
 
05:59:22.868 --> 05:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
think the time frame is a good idea I
 
05:59:24.708 --> 05:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
just think my experience has been often
 
05:59:27.350 --> 05:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
times we wait forever it feels like for
 
05:59:28.830 --> 05:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
other states to get back to us or other
 
05:59:31.270 --> 05:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
agencies to get back to us to give us
 
05:59:32.708 --> 05:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
the correct information we need to make
 
05:59:34.628 --> 05:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
a determination often times just a
 
05:59:36.310 --> 05:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
conviction record or a criminal record
 
05:59:38.910 --> 05:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
does not speak to the depth that we need
 
05:59:40.910 --> 05:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
to make a determination for drug charges
 
05:59:43.390 --> 05:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
or for fam familial relationships if
 
05:59:45.468 --> 05:59:45.478 align:start position:0%
it's an assault case and that's where we
 
05:59:47.430 --> 05:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
have to reach out to police departments
 
05:59:49.990 --> 05:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes to get the police report
 
05:59:51.990 --> 05:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
to understand is this a qualifying or a
 
05:59:54.310 --> 05:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
disqualifying in this case relationship
 
05:59:55.590 --> 05:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
and so those are the things that that
 
05:59:58.788 --> 05:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
often take up a lot of time and
 
06:00:01.070 --> 06:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
um just take longer than they probably
 
06:00:02.430 --> 06:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
should because although they're urgent
 
06:00:04.070 --> 06:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
to us they're not urgent to that other
 
06:00:05.270 --> 06:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
that other state or that other agency
 
06:00:07.788 --> 06:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
we're having to reach out to one thing
 
06:00:09.750 --> 06:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask you is can you kind of
 
06:00:11.750 --> 06:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
give a rundown on what happens if say an
 
06:00:13.548 --> 06:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
individual comes back as being a
 
06:00:15.270 --> 06:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
prohibited in individual to purchase a
 
06:00:17.390 --> 06:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
firearm or possess a firearm and they've
 
06:00:18.830 --> 06:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
already received it because the days
 
06:00:21.190 --> 06:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
have it lapsed underneath the Brady Law
 
06:00:23.110 --> 06:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
what is a mechanism for dealing with an
 
06:00:25.150 --> 06:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
individual that has a firearm that the
 
06:00:26.708 --> 06:00:26.718 align:start position:0%
background check comes back later and
 
06:00:29.948 --> 06:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
says they are now prohibited correct so
 
06:00:31.750 --> 06:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
from the FFL standpoint I realize it's a
 
06:00:33.110 --> 06:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
little off base from from the attent
 
06:00:35.070 --> 06:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
here but um what happens is the dealer
 
06:00:37.750 --> 06:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
will call the purchaser and say hey we
 
06:00:39.310 --> 06:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
got you get we got your background check
 
06:00:40.910 --> 06:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
back you're you're going to be denied we
 
06:00:42.990 --> 06:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
need you to return the firearm if that
 
06:00:45.670 --> 06:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen the ATF gets notified um
 
06:00:47.110 --> 06:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
and then it's on the ATF and their
 
06:00:48.670 --> 06:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility to then go retrieve that
 
06:00:50.430 --> 06:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
firearm and we make notice to them that
 
06:00:52.390 --> 06:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
or the between us and the FFL notice is
 
06:00:54.830 --> 06:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
made that um you know that this person
 
06:00:57.510 --> 06:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
is TE technically a denial and and that
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
retrieval of that firearm begins from
 
06:01:02.510 --> 06:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
from the atfs say so thank you anyone
 
06:01:04.868 --> 06:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
else have any question representative
 
06:01:07.628 --> 06:01:07.638 align:start position:0%
Muse when you look at the the current
 
06:01:11.708 --> 06:01:11.718 align:start position:0%
process um and this newly proposed
 
06:01:15.350 --> 06:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
process um are there how would you
 
06:01:17.590 --> 06:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
compare them in terms of the
 
06:01:19.910 --> 06:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
protectiveness of the victim because
 
06:01:21.948 --> 06:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
these do involve uh folks who had
 
06:01:24.230 --> 06:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
weapons taken away from them uh because
 
06:01:27.110 --> 06:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
they're under a restraining order so the
 
06:01:29.868 --> 06:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
the safety of the person you know that
 
06:01:32.110 --> 06:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
the court decided should be protected
 
06:01:33.868 --> 06:01:33.878 align:start position:0%
you know seems to be an important
 
06:01:35.788 --> 06:01:35.798 align:start position:0%
consideration here I'm just wondering is
 
06:01:38.510 --> 06:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
it is it the same is it different in
 
06:01:41.510 --> 06:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
some way we're always concerned for the
 
06:01:42.868 --> 06:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
victim first and
 
06:01:46.030 --> 06:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
foremost but again we have to follow the
 
06:01:48.868 --> 06:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
rules that are set for us so if a court
 
06:01:51.030 --> 06:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
tells me or tells whomever in my
 
06:01:53.750 --> 06:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
department they can have the guns back
 
06:01:55.628 --> 06:01:55.638 align:start position:0%
that's the way that it is and the onus
 
06:01:57.948 --> 06:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
falls on the court at that point
 
06:02:01.270 --> 06:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have really the the right or
 
06:02:03.310 --> 06:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility to deny someone their
 
06:02:05.270 --> 06:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
firearms just
 
06:02:07.390 --> 06:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
because for the most part I mean you
 
06:02:09.948 --> 06:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
know we can take guns if we have to in a
 
06:02:11.670 --> 06:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
protective mode but then there's a whole
 
06:02:14.190 --> 06:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
process that follows that uh for all
 
06:02:15.628 --> 06:02:15.638 align:start position:0%
intents and purposes or we can get them
 
06:02:17.910 --> 06:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
out of the house type of thing but
 
06:02:19.948 --> 06:02:19.958 align:start position:0%
that's more on the local that would be
 
06:02:22.430 --> 06:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
more on the local side other than the
 
06:02:23.868 --> 06:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
and not to speak for the captain but
 
06:02:25.430 --> 06:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
having spent 23 years in the State
 
06:02:27.830 --> 06:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
Police uh other than the the individual
 
06:02:29.590 --> 06:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
troops would deal with some of these
 
06:02:32.190 --> 06:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
issues uh when they work in in different
 
06:02:34.868 --> 06:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities if that makes sense I
 
06:02:36.510 --> 06:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
guess another way of of maybe asking
 
06:02:39.430 --> 06:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
that question is is is there anything in
 
06:02:41.590 --> 06:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
the way that this change is written
 
06:02:46.190 --> 06:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's actually more protective of uh
 
06:02:48.590 --> 06:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
the people that we're trying to protect
 
06:02:50.670 --> 06:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh than the current
 
06:02:54.788 --> 06:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
statute that might be a little bit of a
 
06:02:57.070 --> 06:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
qualitative answer than a quantitative
 
06:02:57.080 --> 06:02:58.110 align:start position:0%
qualitative answer than a quantitative
one

06:02:58.110 --> 06:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:03:01.110 --> 06:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
but by putting a particular time frame
 
06:03:03.750 --> 06:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
on it making sure the Judiciary knows
 
06:03:06.270 --> 06:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
what its responsibilities are we can
 
06:03:08.230 --> 06:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
contribute to that certainly we we're
 
06:03:09.750 --> 06:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
offering as much protection to the
 
06:03:12.510 --> 06:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
victims as we can legally give them does
 
06:03:15.628 --> 06:03:15.638 align:start position:0%
that make sense hope thank you question
 
06:03:16.788 --> 06:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
for the
 
06:03:19.270 --> 06:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
captain under uh New Hampshire law and
 
06:03:20.750 --> 06:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
federal law to your best of your
 
06:03:22.548 --> 06:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
knowledge uh what happens if a
 
06:03:24.628 --> 06:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
restraining order expires is there any
 
06:03:26.548 --> 06:03:26.558 align:start position:0%
prohibitions if there's no other
 
06:03:28.110 --> 06:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on individual from purchase
 
06:03:30.310 --> 06:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
a firearm that next
 
06:03:32.670 --> 06:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
day no and I think that's one of those
 
06:03:35.110 --> 06:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
loophole areas where if if they're going
 
06:03:37.150 --> 06:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
to purchase a firearm and the and the
 
06:03:39.390 --> 06:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
order is expired we're doing the ncks
 
06:03:41.270 --> 06:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
check or the check at the time the
 
06:03:43.230 --> 06:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
purchase is made so if that if that
 
06:03:44.868 --> 06:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
order is expired it's out of the system
 
06:03:46.230 --> 06:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
so to speak we're not going to see it
 
06:03:48.030 --> 06:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a proceed on that
 
06:03:50.670 --> 06:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
purchase relative to this topic it may
 
06:03:52.190 --> 06:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
be a little bit muddier because now
 
06:03:53.708 --> 06:03:53.718 align:start position:0%
we've got guns in possession of the
 
06:03:55.430 --> 06:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
police and how do we return those things
 
06:03:57.510 --> 06:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
and it can't just simply be I'm to speak
 
06:03:58.948 --> 06:03:58.958 align:start position:0%
for the chief but I work for a local PD
 
06:04:01.350 --> 06:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
and we're taking each other's roles here
 
06:04:03.750 --> 06:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
yeah um but we're not just going to have
 
06:04:06.390 --> 06:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
a a a defendant or an arreste show up at
 
06:04:08.030 --> 06:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
the police station and say I'd like my
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
guns back and you know and just give
 
06:04:10.468 --> 06:04:10.478 align:start position:0%
them to them you know what I mean that
 
06:04:12.150 --> 06:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's that is obviously what this
 
06:04:14.430 --> 06:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
process would would would detail so
 
06:04:15.910 --> 06:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
that's kind of one of those areas where
 
06:04:17.708 --> 06:04:17.718 align:start position:0%
are you are you do you own it currently
 
06:04:19.390 --> 06:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
are you purchasing it and it's I don't
 
06:04:20.948 --> 06:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
want to say a loophole but the
 
06:04:23.468 --> 06:04:23.478 align:start position:0%
difference in in process I guess as to
 
06:04:25.030 --> 06:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
but to clarify at the end of the day it
 
06:04:26.510 --> 06:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
still gives the ability to possess a
 
06:04:28.670 --> 06:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
firearm yes if in absence of any
 
06:04:30.670 --> 06:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
protective order correct so it makes it
 
06:04:32.868 --> 06:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
kind of a moot
 
06:04:35.590 --> 06:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
point representative Manion yes so they
 
06:04:37.628 --> 06:04:37.638 align:start position:0%
just commented so
 
06:04:39.430 --> 06:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
basically same things happen if they
 
06:04:41.110 --> 06:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
want to buy a gun they can go buy one
 
06:04:42.948 --> 06:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
but you're under a court order to take
 
06:04:45.190 --> 06:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
the weapons it's my understanding you
 
06:04:46.948 --> 06:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
would need a court order to return them
 
06:04:47.990 --> 06:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
even though the same thing's going to
 
06:04:49.590 --> 06:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
happen having the gun it's not
 
06:04:50.868 --> 06:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily with it's a gun or not
 
06:04:52.190 --> 06:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
there's a court order to take that
 
06:04:53.990 --> 06:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
property you got to need a court order
 
06:04:55.430 --> 06:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
to give it back to them correct to
 
06:04:56.910 --> 06:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
protect the department from liability
 
06:04:59.230 --> 06:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
06:05:03.390 --> 06:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:06.350 --> 06:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions yes I do representative G
 
06:05:09.430 --> 06:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
based on what you just said so today you
 
06:05:12.030 --> 06:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
don't need a court order is that part of
 
06:05:14.868 --> 06:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
the issue you can just to purchase a gun
 
06:05:16.628 --> 06:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
you don't need a court order if the guns
 
06:05:18.270 --> 06:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
are in police possession I think is what
 
06:05:19.468 --> 06:05:19.478 align:start position:0%
we're saying then you would need a court
 
06:05:22.190 --> 06:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
order to return those and that's today
 
06:05:24.628 --> 06:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
correct so I think her confusion is she
 
06:05:26.548 --> 06:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand the process really
 
06:05:29.430 --> 06:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
and it is it is complicated so you get a
 
06:05:31.830 --> 06:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
restraining order to put on against you
 
06:05:33.590 --> 06:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
um and it expires let's say a temporary
 
06:05:35.310 --> 06:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
expires in 30 days you could petition
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
the court to get your Firearms back upon
 
06:05:40.670 --> 06:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
expiration of that order so the theory
 
06:05:43.430 --> 06:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
is is that order expired the state no
 
06:05:45.590 --> 06:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
longer has a right to possess to keep my
 
06:05:48.670 --> 06:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
weapons from me the department saying I
 
06:05:51.310 --> 06:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
agree with you but a court ordered me to
 
06:05:52.708 --> 06:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
take them the court has to order me to
 
06:05:54.390 --> 06:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
give them back to you so they have some
 
06:05:56.510 --> 06:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
documentation to protect them but
 
06:05:58.390 --> 06:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
however the the case today is you still
 
06:06:00.150 --> 06:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
need a court order to take them away and
 
06:06:02.030 --> 06:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
a court order to give them back so and
 
06:06:03.590 --> 06:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening today this just
 
06:06:06.030 --> 06:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
puts a time frame on it so you know the
 
06:06:07.590 --> 06:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
judge isn't schedule a hearing out three
 
06:06:09.030 --> 06:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
months from now or six months from now
 
06:06:11.310 --> 06:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what this is for okay if
 
06:06:13.750 --> 06:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
that am I if I'm missing anything there
 
06:06:15.788 --> 06:06:15.798 align:start position:0%
no I think you got it yeah just to
 
06:06:18.310 --> 06:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
clarify the purpose of this bill is to
 
06:06:20.910 --> 06:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
establish guard rails establish the due
 
06:06:22.750 --> 06:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
process required that most law
 
06:06:24.270 --> 06:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies spoke that they
 
06:06:26.190 --> 06:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
wanted something from a judge
 
06:06:28.070 --> 06:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
authorizing return turn weapons to
 
06:06:30.868 --> 06:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
safeguard their liability interests that
 
06:06:32.590 --> 06:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
was one of the very big sticking points
 
06:06:34.310 --> 06:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we had I think on the previous Bill
 
06:06:37.310 --> 06:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:41.030 --> 06:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
week um would uh you like to speak to
 
06:06:45.230 --> 06:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:47.628 --> 06:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
Pamela come on
 
06:06:55.468 --> 06:06:55.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:58.390 --> 06:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
you good after afternoon um do I need to
 
06:07:01.990 --> 06:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
State my name or it's fine okay Pamela
 
06:07:04.270 --> 06:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
um so I think we just reiterate the
 
06:07:06.270 --> 06:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
concerns raised by both the department
 
06:07:09.350 --> 06:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
in safety and um Chief Goldstein we just
 
06:07:12.750 --> 06:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
really want to make sure that um safety
 
06:07:14.430 --> 06:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
is the priority here when it comes to
 
06:07:16.230 --> 06:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
return of firearms and that the
 
06:07:18.350 --> 06:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate checks are in place I know
 
06:07:20.708 --> 06:07:20.718 align:start position:0%
um this build um keep maintains the
 
06:07:23.670 --> 06:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
current process already in uh 173b and
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
633a 3A um but that's just our priority
 
06:07:29.830 --> 06:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
here is just making sure and so I think
 
06:07:31.868 --> 06:07:31.878 align:start position:0%
if the May
 
06:07:34.110 --> 06:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation um would address those
 
06:07:36.548 --> 06:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
concerns and ensure that the judge has
 
06:07:38.230 --> 06:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
the adequate information to make the
 
06:07:39.750 --> 06:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
right determination that someone isn't
 
06:07:41.990 --> 06:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
legally prohibited um and could be a
 
06:07:45.350 --> 06:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
danger then that probably is fine that
 
06:07:46.990 --> 06:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
that is just our priority is that the
 
06:07:50.070 --> 06:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
safety of victims so does having the uh
 
06:07:52.468 --> 06:07:52.478 align:start position:0%
judicial process of going before a court
 
06:07:54.670 --> 06:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
to have that has jurisdiction over the
 
06:07:58.750 --> 06:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
issue would that satisfy your agency
 
06:08:00.190 --> 06:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
yeah we feel very strongly that the
 
06:08:02.110 --> 06:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
court order piece and everything is
 
06:08:03.390 --> 06:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
maintained so we just really want a
 
06:08:08.150 --> 06:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
clear-cut process um for this and as you
 
06:08:09.910 --> 06:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
probably know the parties would be
 
06:08:11.628 --> 06:08:11.638 align:start position:0%
involved in being noticed for that
 
06:08:13.070 --> 06:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
proceeding so that they could weigh in
 
06:08:14.390 --> 06:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
on any evidence that they felt they
 
06:08:16.390 --> 06:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
should you be required to tell the judge
 
06:08:19.110 --> 06:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
if they feel if there a continuing issue
 
06:08:21.868 --> 06:08:21.878 align:start position:0%
yes yeah we just yeah again we
 
06:08:23.390 --> 06:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate the process laid out
 
06:08:25.548 --> 06:08:25.558 align:start position:0%
currently in statute and so we just want
 
06:08:27.310 --> 06:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that nothing
 
06:08:29.150 --> 06:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
moving forward would supersede that or
 
06:08:31.548 --> 06:08:31.558 align:start position:0%
take away any of the current safeguards
 
06:08:33.548 --> 06:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
so um we appreciate the conversation
 
06:08:35.830 --> 06:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
that was taking place this afternoon
 
06:08:37.830 --> 06:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much does anyone else
 
06:08:40.628 --> 06:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
have any oh I do sorry representative I
 
06:08:44.270 --> 06:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
do have a question just so I uh just so
 
06:08:46.270 --> 06:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
I understand you completely so basically
 
06:08:47.868 --> 06:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you and your
 
06:08:51.150 --> 06:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
organization are okay if on line 31 page
 
06:08:54.750 --> 06:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
one we Chang that shell to a May and
 
06:08:57.708 --> 06:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
that in a situation where
 
06:08:57.718 --> 06:08:59.230 align:start position:0%
that in a situation where
um

06:08:59.230 --> 06:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:03.030 --> 06:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh there there's uncertainty around
 
06:09:05.110 --> 06:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
whether a proceed should be issued that
 
06:09:08.830 --> 06:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
should trigger a hearing a court hearing
 
06:09:12.070 --> 06:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
so um I am still running The Language by
 
06:09:14.990 --> 06:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
a few Folks at my organization but with
 
06:09:17.468 --> 06:09:17.478 align:start position:0%
the um recommendations from the state
 
06:09:19.670 --> 06:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
police and chief Goldstein we're
 
06:09:21.910 --> 06:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable because we have the same
 
06:09:25.110 --> 06:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
concern that that uh Captain muzy yeah
 
06:09:27.390 --> 06:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
maybe you can help jump in we we right
 
06:09:28.910 --> 06:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
now what he was saying with the red
 
06:09:30.948 --> 06:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
light green light and maybe we just
 
06:09:32.830 --> 06:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
really want to make sure that if there's
 
06:09:34.670 --> 06:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
any do you want to just jump in yeah I
 
06:09:37.030 --> 06:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think it's cause for
 
06:09:39.390 --> 06:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
requiring a hearing I think it's just
 
06:09:40.830 --> 06:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
the hearing is already going to happen
 
06:09:43.868 --> 06:09:43.878 align:start position:0%
it's just the ability for the for the
 
06:09:46.150 --> 06:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
fear is that the sh is going to tie the
 
06:09:49.430 --> 06:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
judges hands also of okay only allowing
 
06:09:51.468 --> 06:09:51.478 align:start position:0%
the state police to say proceed or not
 
06:09:54.230 --> 06:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
and we just simply want to present them
 
06:09:56.230 --> 06:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
with whatever information we may have so
 
06:09:57.350 --> 06:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
not that we're looking for another
 
06:10:00.230 --> 06:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
hearing in you know in in that process
 
06:10:03.070 --> 06:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
but just simply not again tying our
 
06:10:05.390 --> 06:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
hands that if it's not a no it's a yes
 
06:10:06.750 --> 06:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
we just want to be able to allow the
 
06:10:08.548 --> 06:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
maybe and say here here's what we have
 
06:10:10.310 --> 06:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
judge in the interest of this person's
 
06:10:12.910 --> 06:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
due process um maybe we don't have
 
06:10:14.430 --> 06:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
everything and now it's on the judge to
 
06:10:16.948 --> 06:10:16.958 align:start position:0%
say okay weighing their due process with
 
06:10:18.310 --> 06:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
what we do have for information let's
 
06:10:20.070 --> 06:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
make the best educated decision we can
 
06:10:21.990 --> 06:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
for what we have for information right
 
06:10:23.910 --> 06:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
here and right now I realize the judges
 
06:10:25.390 --> 06:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
too probably want to have the full
 
06:10:28.548 --> 06:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
answer but you know in the Live Free or
 
06:10:30.190 --> 06:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
Die State we also have to have due
 
06:10:31.990 --> 06:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
process for these people that are not
 
06:10:33.468 --> 06:10:33.478 align:start position:0%
possessing their guns that maybe should
 
06:10:36.390 --> 06:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
be um and so I think in the interest of
 
06:10:39.430 --> 06:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
both of those Arenas it's just simply
 
06:10:42.350 --> 06:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
allowing for us to give that additional
 
06:10:45.310 --> 06:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
input I would feel better if that input
 
06:10:49.070 --> 06:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
was allowed versus again I know that
 
06:10:51.830 --> 06:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
even if the sh remained there's there's
 
06:10:54.670 --> 06:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
some theory that the judge could still
 
06:10:57.150 --> 06:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
take that information however
 
06:10:59.910 --> 06:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
shall is a shall so that says that I the
 
06:11:01.390 --> 06:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
State Department of Safety have to issue
 
06:11:02.948 --> 06:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
a shall proed letter and if that's all
 
06:11:05.590 --> 06:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
the time the judge has to read that's
 
06:11:06.830 --> 06:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
what they're going to have whereas the
 
06:11:09.190 --> 06:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
May opens up the door for me to explain
 
06:11:11.030 --> 06:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
myself you know judge we have a charge
 
06:11:13.390 --> 06:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
out of Brockton district court in
 
06:11:15.030 --> 06:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we've reached out three
 
06:11:16.670 --> 06:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
different occasions for that inform and
 
06:11:18.070 --> 06:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
then if the judge decides okay we're
 
06:11:19.350 --> 06:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to continue this
 
06:11:21.270 --> 06:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
hearing for another 10 days so the state
 
06:11:23.990 --> 06:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
police can demand an answer from that
 
06:11:26.110 --> 06:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
entity I think it just allows some
 
06:11:28.350 --> 06:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
flexib abbility in those probably
 
06:11:30.230 --> 06:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
limited cases where it's really going to
 
06:11:32.750 --> 06:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
be needed again 90% of cases we'll have
 
06:11:35.030 --> 06:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
an answer within 10 days this is a
 
06:11:38.150 --> 06:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
non-issue the other 10% we may get
 
06:11:39.628 --> 06:11:39.638 align:start position:0%
dragged on for some time and we just
 
06:11:41.430 --> 06:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
want the ability to be able to provide
 
06:11:43.230 --> 06:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
that information again if the judge says
 
06:11:45.030 --> 06:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
Nope 10 days is it I'm going to make a
 
06:11:47.230 --> 06:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
decision with what I've got fine we can
 
06:11:50.030 --> 06:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
at least have in good conscience said
 
06:11:51.670 --> 06:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
there's more to information here judge
 
06:11:53.468 --> 06:11:53.478 align:start position:0%
we just don't have all of it that's all
 
06:11:55.990 --> 06:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
no extra hearing and I have um part of
 
06:11:58.150 --> 06:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
the Court protocols for the current
 
06:11:59.468 --> 06:11:59.478 align:start position:0%
process and I'd be happy to share that
 
06:12:01.350 --> 06:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
with you just to kind of better
 
06:12:03.350 --> 06:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully better illustrate um what I
 
06:12:05.948 --> 06:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
was trying to articulate but um I Echo
 
06:12:08.110 --> 06:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
what Captain muzy said I think that
 
06:12:10.510 --> 06:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
would help actually some of the other uh
 
06:12:11.750 --> 06:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee who are
 
06:12:13.510 --> 06:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
struggling who would struggle to
 
06:12:15.750 --> 06:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
understand this is is contrasting the
 
06:12:19.468 --> 06:12:19.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:21.190 --> 06:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
protocol I've been in the business for
 
06:12:22.990 --> 06:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
30 years and I'm still learning trying
 
06:12:24.310 --> 06:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
to get it's
 
06:12:26.628 --> 06:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
complicated this so and just just to
 
06:12:28.628 --> 06:12:28.638 align:start position:0%
clarify the the May would allow the
 
06:12:30.150 --> 06:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
state police to give a letter of
 
06:12:32.708 --> 06:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
explanation if you will on where they're
 
06:12:34.990 --> 06:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
at if they can't provide a proceed
 
06:12:36.670 --> 06:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
response so it' be able to give more
 
06:12:39.310 --> 06:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
information to just the shell well shell
 
06:12:42.030 --> 06:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
issue uh proceed the issue becomes I
 
06:12:43.590 --> 06:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
think if you have a defense attorney at
 
06:12:46.510 --> 06:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
a hearing and it's going to argue your
 
06:12:49.270 --> 06:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
honor law says shall the state police
 
06:12:50.948 --> 06:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
has to give you a proceed letter did
 
06:12:54.590 --> 06:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
they do that you know what I mean and so
 
06:12:58.110 --> 06:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
that's very narrow and it's it's tying
 
06:12:59.590 --> 06:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
everyone's hands and I think you know
 
06:13:00.910 --> 06:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
you you are going to have that argument
 
06:13:02.910 --> 06:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
in good faith again this person has due
 
06:13:05.990 --> 06:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
process rights owed to them um and and
 
06:13:07.910 --> 06:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
the the question becomes not whether the
 
06:13:10.030 --> 06:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
judge is going to consider it but
 
06:13:11.310 --> 06:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
whether an attorney can make a good
 
06:13:12.788 --> 06:13:12.798 align:start position:0%
argument to say you don't need to
 
06:13:14.548 --> 06:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
consider it your honor the law says we
 
06:13:16.270 --> 06:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
they shall they can't they couldn't make
 
06:13:18.788 --> 06:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
a conclusion and they shall issue a
 
06:13:21.430 --> 06:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
proceed letter and so thereby that
 
06:13:22.948 --> 06:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
defense attorney isn't wrong under the
 
06:13:24.350 --> 06:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
letter of of the way it's currently
 
06:13:25.350 --> 06:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
written and
 
06:13:28.868 --> 06:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
so the May will allow us to give
 
06:13:31.510 --> 06:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
whatever information we do have and
 
06:13:34.310 --> 06:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
prohibit that technical argument in my
 
06:13:35.830 --> 06:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
mind from being made by a defense
 
06:13:38.070 --> 06:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
attorney that says it's either a red
 
06:13:39.270 --> 06:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
light green light your honor they didn't
 
06:13:40.788 --> 06:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
give the information oh the onus is on
 
06:13:43.150 --> 06:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
the department of safety or whomever too
 
06:13:44.548 --> 06:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
bad so sad for
 
06:13:47.070 --> 06:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
them if that makes
 
06:13:51.070 --> 06:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
sense anyone else have any questions or
 
06:13:54.270 --> 06:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you once
 
06:13:56.910 --> 06:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
again committee discussion
 
06:14:00.070 --> 06:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh this bill as it is
 
06:14:02.910 --> 06:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
written definitely in my opinion strikes
 
06:14:05.750 --> 06:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
a balance between the individual rights
 
06:14:08.548 --> 06:14:08.558 align:start position:0%
of a defendant and also the protection
 
06:14:10.868 --> 06:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
rights of a victim and the rights of the
 
06:14:13.868 --> 06:14:13.878 align:start position:0%
state to ensure all three shareholders
 
06:14:16.350 --> 06:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
are involved in due
 
06:14:19.548 --> 06:14:19.558 align:start position:0%
process and to be Expediting that due
 
06:14:22.468 --> 06:14:22.478 align:start position:0%
process the state has no legal interest
 
06:14:24.030 --> 06:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
in property once it's been seized if
 
06:14:27.150 --> 06:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
there are no uh prohibits or uh under
 
06:14:29.750 --> 06:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
any other orders and the state should
 
06:14:30.788 --> 06:14:30.798 align:start position:0%
not be in the business of just
 
06:14:33.590 --> 06:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining property just because and I
 
06:14:35.310 --> 06:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
and I think the DU notice given to
 
06:14:37.910 --> 06:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
everyone for hearings gives the local
 
06:14:39.990 --> 06:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
agencies that may be involved as well an
 
06:14:41.270 --> 06:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come and speak if they
 
06:14:43.070 --> 06:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
have valid concerns at a hearing held
 
06:14:46.030 --> 06:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
before a judge uh I just see this bill
 
06:14:47.628 --> 06:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
as kind of really addressing some of the
 
06:14:49.270 --> 06:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
issues that we've been hearing about in
 
06:14:52.190 --> 06:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
the last week or so and with that anyone
 
06:14:54.468 --> 06:14:54.478 align:start position:0%
else have anything like to
 
06:14:57.270 --> 06:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
add just for clarification so we all
 
06:14:59.270 --> 06:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
understand this bill doesn't change the
 
06:15:03.230 --> 06:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
process it just gives timeline so uh
 
06:15:04.868 --> 06:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
things are done quicker than they
 
06:15:06.788 --> 06:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
currently do are done is that is that
 
06:15:08.270 --> 06:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
how I'm understand it yeah basically it
 
06:15:09.910 --> 06:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
just frames in guardrails so that the
 
06:15:12.230 --> 06:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
the courts can't really push it out uh
 
06:15:14.510 --> 06:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
to Crazy amounts of time uh you're
 
06:15:16.110 --> 06:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
holding individuals property that have
 
06:15:18.548 --> 06:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
no legal basis to really be holding it's
 
06:15:19.990 --> 06:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
imperative to get that property returned
 
06:15:21.030 --> 06:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
to their owners if they're not a
 
06:15:22.868 --> 06:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
prohibited person I guess it's that
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
really that
 
06:15:25.200 --> 06:15:27.948 align:start position:0%
really that
simple

06:15:27.948 --> 06:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
simple
 
06:15:31.110 --> 06:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
I do want to say that this is not the
 
06:15:33.468 --> 06:15:33.478 align:start position:0%
not the way we typically do things so
 
06:15:36.868 --> 06:15:36.878 align:start position:0%
the um uh the original bill was was very
 
06:15:39.070 --> 06:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
different um from the one that's in
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
front of us now the original Bill
 
06:15:43.830 --> 06:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
actually would have uh uh required uh
 
06:15:46.070 --> 06:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
the state police to do background checks
 
06:15:48.628 --> 06:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
uh for all firearms uh in New Hampshire
 
06:15:49.948 --> 06:15:49.958 align:start position:0%
not not just
 
06:15:53.788 --> 06:15:53.798 align:start position:0%
handguns uh so when I originally saw the
 
06:15:55.910 --> 06:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
amendment I was a little bit surprised
 
06:15:59.190 --> 06:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
um that it actually replaces that um
 
06:16:02.430 --> 06:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
with something totally different so one
 
06:16:04.910 --> 06:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
of the things that I'm sort of thinking
 
06:16:06.948 --> 06:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
over are all the times in my own head
 
06:16:08.430 --> 06:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
when I've heard a problem come in front
 
06:16:10.110 --> 06:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
of this committee and I get an idea for
 
06:16:13.948 --> 06:16:13.958 align:start position:0%
a great bill and I have to park it
 
06:16:16.670 --> 06:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
because Bill filing time was back in
 
06:16:20.670 --> 06:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
September um so I I think one of the
 
06:16:23.830 --> 06:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
things that uh that I uh have to do some
 
06:16:26.190 --> 06:16:26.200 align:start position:0%
serious thinking about is whether or or
 
06:16:28.270 --> 06:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
not we're doing the rest of the
 
06:16:30.390 --> 06:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee a disservice and the public a
 
06:16:33.510 --> 06:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
disservice um if we'd Simply Be
 
06:16:36.510 --> 06:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
recommending that this bill be accepted
 
06:16:40.590 --> 06:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
um without uh a a formal public hearing
 
06:16:43.468 --> 06:16:43.478 align:start position:0%
because this in effect is a completely
 
06:16:45.430 --> 06:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
different bill from the bill that was
 
06:16:48.510 --> 06:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
originally proposed to us and um I'm not
 
06:16:52.430 --> 06:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
an expert on house procedure but um I
 
06:16:54.150 --> 06:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
would say this bill is sort of in the
 
06:16:57.948 --> 06:16:57.958 align:start position:0%
family of what we kind of of what we do
 
06:16:59.910 --> 06:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
but um I think a good argument could be
 
06:17:03.430 --> 06:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
made it's it's not germine to the to the
 
06:17:08.948 --> 06:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
original bill at hand um uh so I I I
 
06:17:11.548 --> 06:17:11.558 align:start position:0%
understand and I appreciate um you know
 
06:17:13.270 --> 06:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
the arguments and the positions I I
 
06:17:14.788 --> 06:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work that representative
 
06:17:17.868 --> 06:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
Stone has done on this I I recognize
 
06:17:19.628 --> 06:17:19.638 align:start position:0%
that this is a good faith attempt to
 
06:17:23.430 --> 06:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
kind of move us forward in another area
 
06:17:27.230 --> 06:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
um but it's I it's just something I need
 
06:17:29.750 --> 06:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
to do a little bit more thinking about
 
06:17:34.190 --> 06:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:38.030 --> 06:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
it represent gas right yeah why there
 
06:17:40.830 --> 06:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
change the type
 
06:17:44.310 --> 06:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
of the you mean the firearm the initial
 
06:17:46.468 --> 06:17:46.478 align:start position:0%
bill oh the initial bill the problem
 
06:17:48.070 --> 06:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
with the initial bill is we had as a
 
06:17:50.390 --> 06:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
state you have to either be a uh point
 
06:17:52.990 --> 06:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
of contact you can't really under the
 
06:17:56.910 --> 06:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines end up uh doing
 
06:17:59.750 --> 06:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
dealer choice in other words as a dealer
 
06:18:01.590 --> 06:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
currently in in New Hampshire if you go
 
06:18:03.230 --> 06:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
to purchase a handgun that's run by the
 
06:18:05.390 --> 06:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
department of safety if you buy a rifle
 
06:18:08.070 --> 06:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's ran strictly under nxs so you're
 
06:18:10.430 --> 06:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
calling the FBI on NX you're calling the
 
06:18:13.230 --> 06:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
state police on the handgun so if you
 
06:18:15.150 --> 06:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
come into an FFL Holder and you buy a
 
06:18:17.190 --> 06:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
handgun and a rifle well guess what
 
06:18:18.948 --> 06:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
you're being ran under the state police
 
06:18:21.750 --> 06:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
for the Department of safety's gun line
 
06:18:24.110 --> 06:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
so really it's not really was that big
 
06:18:26.110 --> 06:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
of a departure it's something something
 
06:18:27.430 --> 06:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's kind of already be currently done
 
06:18:30.110 --> 06:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
if you buy du dual firearms and the gun
 
06:18:32.350 --> 06:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
line currently I think handles a larger
 
06:18:34.628 --> 06:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
majority of handguns now than they used
 
06:18:37.110 --> 06:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
to is the predominant firearms that are
 
06:18:38.750 --> 06:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
purchased and I don't know if the
 
06:18:42.910 --> 06:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:46.468 --> 06:18:46.478 align:start position:0%
that so in 2023 this the gun line now we
 
06:18:48.670 --> 06:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
do handgun and other checks right what's
 
06:18:51.350 --> 06:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
an other check several different things
 
06:18:53.830 --> 06:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
as defined by the FBI and and kind of a
 
06:18:56.628 --> 06:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
sliding scale of those things
 
06:18:58.350 --> 06:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
we did
 
06:19:01.788 --> 06:19:01.798 align:start position:0%
8455 handgun or other checks in 2023 to
 
06:19:05.990 --> 06:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
the FBI's 39,000 and change long gun
 
06:19:08.750 --> 06:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
checks so those numbers over the past 10
 
06:19:10.390 --> 06:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
years seem to have flip-flopped it
 
06:19:14.110 --> 06:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
seemed the FBI um held more checks than
 
06:19:15.750 --> 06:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
we did and and for whatever reason over
 
06:19:17.548 --> 06:19:17.558 align:start position:0%
the past I'll say eight years or so
 
06:19:20.628 --> 06:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
those those numbers have reversed so we
 
06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh we're doing last year we did 85,000
 
06:19:25.868 --> 06:19:25.878 align:start position:0%
to 40,000 now as a follow-up question do
 
06:19:27.868 --> 06:19:27.878 align:start position:0%
you guys also track uh the Dual
 
06:19:29.390 --> 06:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
purchases such as a long gun and handgun
 
06:19:31.788 --> 06:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
or you just primarily do it as a handgun
 
06:19:33.510 --> 06:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
yeah primarily do as a handgun so in our
 
06:19:35.430 --> 06:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
in our current platform um we ask the
 
06:19:36.868 --> 06:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
dealer is it a handgun or other and the
 
06:19:38.708 --> 06:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
dealers know how to answer that based
 
06:19:41.150 --> 06:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
upon you know so we we are only tracking
 
06:19:42.948 --> 06:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
it as a handgun or another if there's
 
06:19:44.310 --> 06:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
another firearm there we do get
 
06:19:46.468 --> 06:19:46.478 align:start position:0%
obviously not noticed on the Multi Sales
 
06:19:49.230 --> 06:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
and things like that but um yeah we
 
06:19:51.110 --> 06:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
don't we're not tracking whether it's a
 
06:19:53.910 --> 06:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
duel at the moment does that answer some
 
06:19:54.750 --> 06:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
of your
 
06:19:57.590 --> 06:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you
 
06:20:01.390 --> 06:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
Captain represent Manion I think um so
 
06:20:02.510 --> 06:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
this isn't a question this is I'm just
 
06:20:04.350 --> 06:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
going to explain so the initial bill is
 
06:20:05.788 --> 06:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
something completely different however
 
06:20:07.708 --> 06:20:07.718 align:start position:0%
we had a bill earlier in the committee
 
06:20:10.910 --> 06:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
that was geared towards this but was
 
06:20:12.948 --> 06:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
needed some work you need some work so
 
06:20:15.230 --> 06:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
rather than do that he just this bill
 
06:20:18.430 --> 06:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
was turned into different language so
 
06:20:19.750 --> 06:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's a complet it's a completely
 
06:20:21.670 --> 06:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
different build basically but using the
 
06:20:23.548 --> 06:20:23.558 align:start position:0%
same and it still Falls underneath the
 
06:20:25.350 --> 06:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh and I believe it is Germaine we might
 
06:20:27.788 --> 06:20:27.798 align:start position:0%
disagree age represent but it's still
 
06:20:30.270 --> 06:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
Nick checks and background checks on 159
 
06:20:35.590 --> 06:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:37.510 --> 06:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
raised and as we all know this is
 
06:20:39.750 --> 06:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
scheduled for Monday for executing so
 
06:20:41.430 --> 06:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know we have the weekend if anyone
 
06:20:44.910 --> 06:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
